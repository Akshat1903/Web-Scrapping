Questions,Answer
"What is dilation and curettage (D and C, D&C)?","'Dilation and curettage (D and C) is a procedure in which the cervix of the uterus is expanded (dilated) so that the uterine lining (''endometrium'') can be removed with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curet or curette. The procedure is performed for a variety of reasons. Most commonly, this surgery is done in order to help determine the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. It can also be done to help determine the degree of abnormality of the ''endometrium'' in ''cancer'' cases or pre-cancerous cells that are detected by an in-office biopsy. D and C are also sometimes necessary to remove tissue after a ''miscarriage''.'  "
Why do they perform a D and C?,"'In general, a D and C is used to help determine the health of the uterine lining or to remove abnormal tissue. Occasionally, the procedure can correct some of the problems in the uterus such as polyps, ''scar tissue'', or tissue overgrowth.'  "
What are reasons not to have a D and C?,"'There are very few contraindications to D and C. Generally, if a patient is too ill to undergo surgery, she should probably not have this procedure. Furthermore, if the patient is unable to move her legs apart, such as with severe ''arthritis'' in the hips, the surgeon may not be able to perform the procedure since it requires enough movement of the legs to accommodate a speculum. If the femal is ''pregnant'' or thinks that she could be pregnant, she should not have the operation unless the D and C is for the purpose of an abortion or to treat a miscarriage.' "
What happens before surgery?,"'Before a D and C, the same general recommendations for other outpatient procedures apply. It is recommended that the patient take nothing by mouth (food, water, etc.) for at least 6 to 8 hours prior to the scheduled operation. Often, the doctor will see the patient the day before surgery to discuss the procedure and potential complications in detail.' "
Are you awake during a D and C?,"'Most D and Cs are done under general anesthesia. The procedure is typically very short, and general anesthetic can be quickly reversed, with the patient going home later the same day. Some patients prefer or require spinal or epidural blocks, but these forms of anesthesia take more time for the anesthesiologist to perform and require more recovery time for the patient. Occasionally, in a very motivated patient, the procedure can be done under a local anesthetic with or without intravenous ''pain'' medication or twilight ''sleep''. Overall, the choice of anesthetic is a generally determined by the surgeon, the anesthesiologist, and the patient.' "
How is a D and C performed?,"'The D&C is done in a hospital operating room, surgery center, or a room in a doctor’s office that is specifically designated for the procedure. Once you have received anesthesia, you will be placed in a position (similar to that for a ''Pap smear''), and the vagina and cervix are cleansed with an antibacterial scrub (usually Betadine). An instrument is used to grasp the upper portion of the cervix, then gradually, the opening to the uterus is widened with metal dilators to about the size of a large pencil.''Once the dilation has been completed, the curette, which is an instrument with a flat metal loop at the end, is inserted into the uterine ''cavity'' and is used to gently scrape the lining of the uterus. When the surgeon feels the gritty layer of cells just above the muscle of the uterus, then he/she knows that the scraping has gone deep enough to sample the tissue adequately. This scraping is done throughout the uterus, and the tissue that is removed is then sent to a pathologist for microscopic examination.''After the surgeon feels that enough tissue has been obtained, that the entire uterine ''cavity'' has been sampled, or that any abnormal growths that were seen on ''ultrasound'' were removed, then the procedure is stopped. Often, the doctor uses a viewing instrument to examine the uterus visually (''hysteroscopy'') prior to the D and C to make the procedure more complete. This is not, however, always necessary.'  "
What are the possible complications of a D and C?,"'The D and C procedure has a low risk of serious complications. It is normal to experience ''vaginal bleeding'' and/or pelvic cramping (similar to menstrual cramping) for a few days following a D and C. Typically, ''over-the-counter'' ''pain'' medications are sufficient for pain control.''The most common complication that can occur is perforation of the uterus with either the dilators or the curette. When this happens, as long as no internal organs (''intestines'', bladder, or rectum) or large blood vessels are damaged, the hole will usually will heal itself without further surgery. The risk for this problem is increased in patients with a narrowed opening to the cervix (cervical stenosis) or in females with distorted internal uterine anatomy. This risk is also increased if the uterus is infected or has undergone previous surgeries such as cesarean sections or myomectomies.''Injury to the cervix is another possible complication. Tears or ''cuts'' in the cervix can usually be treated by application of pressure and application of local medications to stop bleeding. In some cases, ''stitches'' in the cervix may be required, but this is not common.''Other complications, as with any surgery, include bleeding and infection. Most bleeding is mild and resolves on its own. Infection is also rare and can normally be managed with oral antibiotics. Most D and Cs do not require the routine use of post-operative antibiotics. On occasion, in patients with certain ''heart'' defects, the surgeon may give the patient antibiotics before and after the surgery to prevent bacteria from the vagina from infecting the heart valves.'  "
What happens after a D and C?,"'After the surgery, the patient is cared for in a post-anesthesia care unit during recovery from the anesthesia. Most patients can return to normal activities within a few days. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications may be recommended to relieve the mild pain and cramping that may follow. To decrease the chance of developing an infection, doctors advise that patients not use tampons or insert anything into the vagina for two weeks following the surgery, and to abstain from sexual intercourse for the same time period.''The follow-up office care depends on the surgeon. Most doctors have the patient return to the office to make sure that all is well and to discuss the results of the tissue samples that were removed. Usually, this is done 2 to 6 weeks post-operatively. Sometimes, the patient will simply be notified by a phone call with the results, and no direct contact with a health professional is necessary.' "
Why is the D and C procedure becoming less common?,"'In general, the number of D and Cs being performed has declined over the years. This procedure is no longer done to regulate abnormal bleeding patterns in women. Most of these problems are now managed with medications, such as hormones. Ultrasound and other imaging techniques are likewise playing a greater role in helping to evaluate the uterus without surgery.''Probably the single greatest reason for fewer D and Cs is the option of in-office endometrial sampling (biopsy) that can be performed with a very thin ''plastic'' suction curette. This procedure is very quick and easy, and generally is only as painful as a bad menstrual cramp. If the patient is given some oral pain medications before the procedure, the ''cramps'' are minimal. Furthermore, the tissue sample obtained is in many instances as good as that achieved during a D and C surgery.' "
What is dandruff?,"'Dandruff'' (also known as ''seborrheic dermatitis'') is a ''scalp'' condition, usually chronic, in which skin on the scalp forms flakes that are then shed from the scalp. These flakes consist of dead cells, and while it is normal for dead cells to be shed, with ''dandruff'', a large number of these cells are shed at a faster rate than normal and become visible in the hair and on clothing. The cause of ''dandruff'' is not well known; some individuals consider it related to variations in hormone production.' "
Is dandruff contagious?,"'No, dandruff is not ''contagious'' or infectious. However, dandruff may get worse if certain yeasts and/or fungi that normally occur in small numbers on the scalp are increased in numbers. The increase in these microbes can contribute to increased flaking in dandruff. Because most of these organisms are already present on the skin, they are not considered to be contagious causes of dandruff.''However, another term that modifies the word dandruff is ''walking'' dandruff''. This skin condition is usually seen in dog skin infected with small mites. These mites can be transmitted to other animals, including humans; consequently, walking dandruff in ''dogs'', cats, and other animals can be contagious to humans. Walking dandruff in animals (and in humans) can be cured with topical medication to kill mites. This is in no way related to the dandruff that is commonly seen on the scalp of many individuals.' "
How will I know if I have dandruff?,"'A person will know they have dandruff if they see whitish, dry-appearing thin flakes in their hair, on their scalp, or on their clothing. ''Itching'' of the scalp may also be associated with dandruff. Some symptoms and signs of dandruff may improve after a reduction of ''stress''; others may have a reduction in symptoms and signs during the summer months. Usually, a person does not need a medical ''caregiver'' to diagnose dandruff.' "
What causes dandruff?,"""Because the cause of dandruff is unclear and dandruff is not considered to be contagious, the only spread of dandruff is usually on the person's body. In most individuals, dandruff is confined to the scalp. However, dandruff may spread in an individual by occurring all over the scalp and may occur in other areas on the skin (for example, nasal folds on the face)."" "
How to get rid of dandruff: remedies,"'Although there is no cure for dandruff, people can reduce and practically eliminate the symptoms and signs associated with dandruff; some obtain good results with over-the-counter dandruff shampoos that contain zinc pyrithione, salicylic acid or selenium sulfide. However, these shampoos are not a cure for dandruff because such shampoos only cause smaller and less visible flakes to be shed. Frequent washing even with regular shampoo may also reduce dandruff symptoms and signs.''If yeast/fungi that occur normally on skin or scalp are contributing to dandruff symptoms and signs, some doctors recommend 1% ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral'' shampoo) to reduce symptoms,\xa0although there is no credible evidence that this prescription shampoo works better than the over-the-counter variety.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about dandruff?,"'Most people do not need to contact a medical caregiver about dandruff. However, if ''itching'' is increasing and is associated with dandruff, if dandruff shampoo fails to reduce dandruff symptoms, or if inflammation (skin or scalp redness and swelling) and severe skin shedding occurs, contact a physician.' "
What is dandruff?,"'The exact origin of the term is rather obscure. ''Dander'' consists of white to tan flakes found on fur or feathers. ''Ruff'', the second syllable, probably originates from the word ''scurfy'', which means scale arising from the most superficial layer of the skin. In any case, ''dandruff'' ''is the popular term for the small white flakes that conspicuously appear on the shoulders of your black sweater or blouse after your scratch your ''flaky scalp''. This is distinctly different from the much larger white flakes and dead skin cells that can result from ''psoriasis'', a skin disease that can respond to coal tar treatments. ''Dandruff'' is also not from a fungal infection that could respond to ''ketoconazole''. ''Dandruff'' is also distinctly different from ''eczema'' that responds to cortisone creams and ''contact dermatitis'', which is an immune reaction to a chemical or metal.' "
What is dry scalp?,"'Dry ''scalp'' is simply ''dry skin'"" in the densely haired area on the top of one's head. ""'Dry ''scalp'"" is not a medical term and really shouldn't be used to describe any disease involving excess scale noted in the hair. Unlike other parts of the body, the scalp is naturally very oily and greasy. This is true for two reasons:""'I do not believe that dry scalp is a common problem. The belief that excess scale in the scalp is ever due to dryness is almost always incorrect and can lead to mistreatment of the real cause. So for the remainder of the article, I will refrain from using the term ''dry scalp''.' The skin in the scalp area produces more skin grease (sebum) that originates from hair follicles and the skin than any other anatomical region. Realistically, the most anyone washes their hair is once a day, and frequently much less often than that. Shampooing with soap is responsible for removing moisturizing fats (lipids) that naturally accumulate on the scalp and hair to prevent dryness and flaking. It would require multiple washes per day of a hairless scalp to achieve significant drying (xerosis). Dry skin (xerodermatitis) does not just happen because of dry air, but it can occur because of hormones out of balance (such as hypothyroidism) and with increasing age."
What are causes and risk factors for dandruff?,"'The presence of ''dandruff'"" in abundance is a clue to either the presence of an inflammatory skin disease affecting the scalp or a relative lack of shampooing. All skin constantly sheds dead skin cells, if one does not remove them, they will accumulate, appearing as white to yellow flakes on one's clothing. Alternatively, an inflammatory skin disease affecting the scalp, such as ""'seborrhea'' ''dermatitis'' (''eczema''), ''psoriasis'', or a fungal infection, can cause rapid growth of skin cells, producing excess scaling so abundant that it is often impossible to remove it even by shampooing frequently.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of dandruff?,"'Dandruff'"" is a sign of a potential scalp problem if it is present in excess. If one neglects washing one's hair, it is perfectly reasonable to expect to see ""'dandruff''. Simple regular shampooing will resolve the problem. On the other hand, if there is an inflammatory disease that is responsible for the production of excessive scaling, then treatment of this underlying problem can control the production of those unsightly flakes of skin. If a disease is present, dandruff is frequently accompanied by ''itching''.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose dandruff?,"'A physical examination of the scalp skin is necessary to determine if a disease is present. Occasionally, a doctor may remove a portion of the scalp skin surgically so a pathologist can examine it to aid the physician in arriving at the correct diagnosis. Dermatologists have the most expertise in correctly diagnosing and treating scalp diseases.' "
What are treatments and medications for dandruff?,"'The most common scalp disease producing excessive dandruff is ''seborrheic dermatitis''. The cause is unclear (it is believed by some to be due to excess growth of the skin yeasts ''Pityrosporum'' or ''Malassezia''), but a disturbance in the balance between normal scalp microbes has been postulated. It is easily controlled with safe, effective topical medications. ''Seborrheic dermatitis'' is characterized by exacerbations and remissions and recurs if treatment is stopped. There is no known cure.''Medicated, anti-dandruff shampoos containing zinc pyrithione, coal tar, salicylic acid, selenium sulfide, or ''ketoconazole'' are effective at controlling seborrheic dermatitis. It is not unusual to supplement these shampoos with a medium potency topical steroid lotion, solution, or foam applied to the scalp once or twice a day. There is little compelling evidence to suggest that either ''tea tree oil'' products (a single Australian study funded by the ''Tea Tree Oil'' Institute in 2002 using a 5% tea tree oil shampoo reduced dandruff in healthy individuals) or apple cider vinegar is of any benefit in controlling dandruff. Since a variety of other skin diseases can affect the scalp, an examination by a physician with special expertise in treating and diagnosing skin diseases is recommended if nonprescription shampoos are ineffective.' "
What is the prognosis for dandruff?,"'If the dandruff is related to the infrequent use of shampoo, it often can be controlled entirely by more frequent washing. If it is due to seborrheic dermatitis, it is easily controlled with a variety of shampoos and the use of topical steroids products. These products do not cure the problem. If treatment is discontinued, the disease will eventually return. They should use effective treatment just frequently enough to control the problem. Excessive use is just a waste of money and will not improve the long-term outlook. Other scalp diseases causing dandruff require more specific treatments.' "
Is it possible to prevent dandruff?,"'The best ''prevention'' is probably to use an anti-dandruff shampoo (medicated shampoo, such as selenium sulfide shampoo) as your regular shampoo frequently and regularly.' "
What are lice?,"'Lice are small parasites that can affect three areas of the ''human body''. ''Head lice'' (the subject of this article), ''body lice'', and ''pubic lice'' (also known as ''crabs'') are causes by three different but related parasites. Lice infestation occurs only in humans. ''Head lice'' infestation is by far and away the most common version of the three parasitic infections and is very ''contagious'"". Direct contact or sharing of items (fomites) that would touch the infected individual's hair/scalp is the primary mode of transmission from one person to another. Examples would include sharing caps, combs/hairbrushes, headphones, etc."" "
What is dandruff?,"'Dandruff, also called seborrheic dermatitis, is not an infection and not contagious. Rather it is a scalp abnormality that causes dry, scaly flakes to be shed in excess. Another manifestation of seborrheic dermatitis that may affect infants more frequently is commonly called cradle cap. This scalp change appears as scaly scalp areas that have a greasy character rather than the dryness of classical dandruff (which is not usually seen in infants or toddlers).' "
What are the causes and risk factors of lice infestations and dandruff?,"'Lice infestation is a person-to-person transmission of a parasite via contaminated agents (fomites) that facilitate transfer of the agent. Such agents would include caps, combs/hairbrushes, pillows, and headphones. Lice infestation is highly contagious and is very common in the toddler and early childhood grades. Between 6-12 million children from 3-11 years of age will develop a lice infestation annually. Crowded conditions, day care centers, and female gender (more likely to share hair brushes/combs) are risk factors. For reasons not fully understood, African-American hair is less likely to support a lice infection.''The presence of dandruff is extremely common. Many teen and adults have experienced such scalp changes. Some experience repeated exacerbations of the condition and may someday to be demonstrated to have a genetic predisposition to dandruff. Seborrheic dermatitis (cradle cap) is similarly a very common scalp situation found in the infant and toddler. Similar to dandruff, the situation may be of minimal consequence to some and a repeated experience to others. Neither condition reflects ''poor hygiene''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a lice infestation and dandruff?,"'While both lice infestation and dandruff share common signs and symptoms, both may also occasionally appear without symptoms. Common elements include moderate scalp ''itching'' and small (2 mm in length) ivory white/opalescent material on the hairs shaft. Scalp lice infestation tends to occur predominately at the nape of the neck and may demonstrate immature lice (called ""nits"") attached to hair shafts approximately 1-2 cm from the scalp. Mature forms of lice (3-5 mm in length, resembling a mobile sesame seed) may be observed moving over the scalp surface. Dandruff affects the entire scalp and is unique (vs. lice) in that small white flakes are easily demonstrated on the shoulders after rubbing the scalp. The scalp of an infant with cradle cap will characteristically demonstrate the area to have a yellow greasy character that may be loosened and removed by scraping with a fingernail.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose a lice infestation and dandruff?,"'A history and physical examination allow accurate identification of the diagnosis. The characteristic changes in the scalp and examination for nits/mature lice help solidify the diagnosis. A Wood\'s lamp (""black light"") may be used to facilitate demonstration of nits on the hair shaft. It is rare that a specialist (such as a dermatologist) would need to be consulted.' "
What are the treatments for a lice infestation and dandruff?,"'Treatment for lice consists of application of over-the-counter shampoos that contain either ''permethrin'' 1% (Nix, Rid, A200) or ''pyrethrin'' (Pronto). The former agent is generally used in that it kills both nits and adult lice whereas the latter is only lethal against lice (but not nits). In addition, permethrin products continue to be effective for several days after the shampoo is washed out. A repeat shampoo is recommended for both agents seven to 10 days after the first application. A prescription shampoo (''ivermectin'' [Sklice]) is available if the above over-the-counter measures are not effective. ''Nit'' removal from hair shafts using a fine-toothed comb is worthwhile. Combs used to remove fleas from ''dogs'' and cats work well. All potential contact items (combs, caps, etc.) should be washed in water between 120-140 degrees. All other fomites (sofa cushions, pillows, towels, etc.) should be thoroughly vacuumed. The CDC recommends that all family members be screened for lice infestation and treated if demonstrated to be infected. Those not infected do not need to be treated.''Effective treatment of dandruff involves using an anti-dandruff shampoo (Head & Shoulders, T-Gel, etc.) that are effective but may require daily use to establish control of the situation. Infants and toddlers with seborrheic dermatitis (cradle cap) usually respond well to washing the scalp with routine baby shampoos. If the scalp is excessively involved, using the adult anti-dandruff shampoos detailed above may be safely used.' "
What is the prognosis for a lice infestation and for dandruff?,"'Both conditions carry an excellent prognosis. Repeated therapy may be required if the primary problem is not addressed (for example, not sharing hairbrushes). The symptoms (moderate itching of the scalp) are typically bothersome but not severe.' "
Is it possible to prevent a lice infestation and dandruff?,"'Following scalp/hair hygiene by not sharing items that may be contaminated by lice is effective prevention. Dandruff and/or cradle cap are not preventable at this time. However, they are only cosmetic by nature and not contagious and effectively treated by simple measures.' "
What are date rape drugs?,"'Date rape drugs are any type of drug or alcohol used to make rape or sexual assault easier. Drugs or alcohol can make a person confused about what is happening, less able to defend themselves against unwanted sexual contact, or unable to remember what happened. Learn more about how date rape drugs are used.''Many people use the phrase ""date rape."" But the person who commits the crime might not be in a relationship, or on a date, with the victim. Someone who commits date rape can be someone you know well, someone you know through friends, or someone you just met.'  "
What are the most common date rape drugs?,"'People who use date rape drugs or alcohol to commit sexual assault most often use alcohol alone or in combination with other drugs. Learn more about how alcohol is linked to sexual assault.''Someone could use any type of drug, including ''marijuana'', ''cocaine'', or prescription or ''over-the-counter'' drugs like ''antidepressants'', tranquilizers, or sleeping aids to overpower a victim or make them not remember an assault.''Other date rape drugs include flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), and ketamine. These drugs are sometimes called ""club drugs"" because they are often used at dance clubs, concerts, bars, or parties. Most drugs, including club drugs, have nicknames that change over time or are different in different areas of the country.'  "
How are date rape drugs used?,"'Someone can use date rape drugs or alcohol to overpower you so you do not know what is happening or remember the assault. Sometimes date rape drugs are put into a drink without you knowing. Or, you may be drinking alcohol or taking a drug, but someone else makes it stronger without you knowing.' "
What do date rape drugs look like?,"'Some date rape drugs look like regular drinks or other drugs you may be used to seeing. Drugs such as Rohypnol, GHB, GBL, and ketamine may look like pills, liquid, or powders. Often date rape drugs have no color, no smell, and no taste when added to a drink or food. Learn about the most common date rape drugs.'""If someone adds a date rape drug to a drink, it may change the color of a clear drink or make your drink look cloudy. But changes can be hard to see if the drink is dark (such as cola or beer) or if the room is dark. You can't always tell if a drug has been added to your drink just by looking at it or tasting it. Read steps you can take to be safer in social situations where there are drinks."" "
How do date rape drugs and alcohol affect the body?,"'Drugs such as Rohypnol, GHB, GBL, and ketamine are very powerful. They can affect you very quickly, and you might not know that something is wrong. The length of time that the effects last varies. It depends on how much of the drug is in your body and if the drug is mixed with other drugs or alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of drugs even stronger and can cause serious health problems -- even death.''Date rape drugs or too much alcohol can make you:''Drugs and alcohol can cause problems thinking, making decisions, and remembering what happened.' Dizzy Have problems talking or slurred speech Have trouble moving or controlling your muscles Feel nauseous or vomit Have a very slow or very fast heartbeat Sleepy Confused Have trouble breathing Pass out"
How is alcohol linked to sexual assault?,"""People who use date rape drugs or alcohol to commit sexual assault most often use alcohol alone or in combination with other drugs. They may use alcohol as a way to make someone drunk and unable to consent, understand what is happening, or remember the assault. They may take advantage of someone who has already been drinking or pressure them to drink more than they might normally drink. They may also use drugs to increase the alcohol's effects. Drinking alcohol and taking drugs at the same time increases the risk of sexual assault.""'Using alcohol is sometimes linked to sexual assault because:''If you are drunk or passed out you cannot give consent for sexual activity. Without consent, any sexual activity is illegal, no matter how much you had to drink, if you took drugs, or how old you are.' The attacker was drinking. Research shows that up to 3 out of 4 attackers had been drinking alcohol when they sexually assaulted someone. The victim was drinking. Research also shows that about half of sexual assault victims had been drinking. However, this does not mean that drinking causes sexual assault or that the assault is the victim's fault."
What steps can I take to be safer in social situations?,"'Anyone can take steps to be as safe as possible around others:''If you think someone has drugged you or a friend, call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room. Even though it may be difficult, it is important to tell a doctor or nurse what happened and that you might have been drugged so they can test for the right drugs.'  Be aware of drinks in punchbowls or other containers that can be easily ""spiked"" (when alcohol or another drug is added to a drink without permission). Don't accept drinks from other people. If someone offers to get you a drink from a bar or at a party, go with the person to order your drink. Watch your drink as it is poured and carry it yourself. Open your drink yourself. Keep control of it at all times. Don't drink anything that smells strange. Stop drinking any drink that tastes strange. Some date rape drugs may taste salty or bitter, but most are tasteless and odorless. Don't drink more than you want to just because someone else wants you to. Don't drink more than you want to so that someone else will like you or be impressed. Get help right away if you feel drunk and haven't had any alcohol or if you feel like the effects of drinking alcohol are stronger than usual. Find a friend who can help you get to a safe place. Look out for your friends, and ask them to look out for you. You can play a powerful role in helping other people stay safe. If a friend seems out of it, seems much too drunk for the amount of alcohol she drank, is acting out of character, or seems too drunk to stay safe in general, get her to a safe place. Ask your friends to do the same for you. Learn more from the Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network (RAINN) about how you can help prevent sexual assault as a bystander (link is external)."
Are there ways to tell if I might have been drugged and raped?,"""Date rape drugs can make you feel drunk even if you haven't drunk any alcohol. You may also feel like the effects of drinking alcohol are much stronger than usual or more than you expect based on how much you drank.""'Date rape drugs also affect your memory. This can make it difficult to tell if you were drugged and raped. You might not be aware of an attack until many hours later, or you may not remember what happened.''You might have been drugged and raped if:''If you notice any of these signs, and also wake up having no memory of a period of time, or remember having a drink but cannot recall anything after that, you may have been drugged and assaulted.''Learn what to do if you think you have been drugged and raped.'

What is the design of the spine?,"'The vertebrae are the bony building blocks of the spine. Between each of the largest part of the vertebrae are the discs. Ligaments are situated around the spine and discs. The spine has seven vertebrae in the neck (cervical vertebrae of the cervical spine), 12 vertebrae in the mid-back (thoracic vertebrae of the thoracic spine), and five vertebrae in the low back (''lumbar vertebrae'' of the lumbar spine). In addition, in the mid-buttock beneath the fifth lumbar vertebra are five sacral vertebrae -- usually fused as the ''sacrum'' bone followed by the tailbone (''coccyx'').' "
What is the purpose of the spine and its discs?,"'The bony spine is designed so that vertebrae ""stacked"" together can provide a movable support structure. The spine also protects the spinal cord (nervous tissue that extends down the spinal column from the brain) from injury. Each vertebra has a ''bony arch behind the spinal cord that shields the cord\'s nerve tissue. The vertebrae also have a strong bony ""body"" in front of the spinal cord to provide a platform suitable for weight-bearing.''The spinal discs are pads that serve as cushions between each vertebral body that serve to minimize the impact of movement on the spinal column. Because the discs are situated between vertebrae, they are sometimes referred to as intervertebral discs. Each disc is designed like a jelly donut with a central softer component (nucleus pulposus) surrounded by a firmer ring of tissue (annulus fibrosus). With injury or degeneration, this softer component can sometimes rupture (herniate) through the surrounding outer ring (annulus fibrosus) and irritate adjacent nervous tissue. Ligaments are strong fibrous soft tissues that firmly attach bones to bones. Ligaments attach each of the vertebrae and surround each of the discs. When ligaments are injured as the disc degenerates, localized ''pain'' in the area affected can result.' "
What is degenerative disc disease? What causes degenerative disc disease?,"'As we age, the water and protein content of the cartilage of the body changes. This change results in weaker, more fragile, and thin cartilage. Because both the discs and the joints that stack the vertebrae (facet joints) are partly composed of cartilage, these areas are subject to wear and tear over time (degenerative changes). The gradual deterioration of the disc between the vertebrae is referred to as degenerative disc disease, sometimes abbreviated DDD. Wear of the facet cartilage and the bony changes of the adjacent joint is referred to as degenerative facet joint disease or ''osteoarthritis'' of the spine. ''Trauma'' injury to the spine can also lead to degenerative disc disease.''Degeneration of the disc space and its contents is medically referred to as spondylosis. Spondylosis can be noted on X-ray tests or ''MRI'' scanning of the spine as a narrowing of the normal ""disc space"" between the adjacent vertebrae.' "
What are degenerative disc disease symptoms?,"'Degeneration of the disc tissue makes the disc more susceptible to herniation. Degenerative spondylosis is another name for degeneration of disc tissue. Degeneration of the disc can cause local pain in the affected area. Any level of the spine can be affected by disc degeneration. When disc degeneration affects the spine of the neck, it is referred to as cervical disc disease. When the mid-back is affected, the condition is referred to as thoracic disc disease. Disc degeneration that affects the lumbar spine can cause ''low back pain'' (referred to as ''lumbago'') or irritation of a ''spinal nerve'' to cause pain radiating down the leg (''sciatica''). ''Lumbago'' causes pain localized to the low back and is common in older people. ''Degenerative arthritis'' (osteoarthritis) of the facet joints that can be detected with plain X-ray testing is also a cause of localized ''lumbar pain''. The pain from degenerative disc or joint disease of the spine is usually treated conservatively with intermittent heat, rest, rehabilitative exercises, and medications to relieve pain, ''muscle spasm'', and inflammation.'

What are the symptoms of radiculopathy and sciatica?,"'Radiculopathy'' refers to nerve irritation caused by damage to the disc between the vertebrae. This occurs because of degeneration (""wear and tear"") of the outer ring of the disc or because of traumatic injury, or both. ''Weakness'' of the outer ring leads to disc bulging and ''disc herniation''. As a result, the central softer portion of the disc can rupture through the outer ring of the disc and abut the spinal cord or its nerves as they exit the bony spinal column.''It is important to note that many people have degenerative spines without having any symptoms. When nerves are irritated in the neck from degenerative disc disease, the condition is referred to as cervical radiculopathy. This can lead to painful burning or tingling sensations in the arms. When nerves are irritated in the low back from degenerative disc disease, the condition is called ''lumbar radiculopathy'', and it often causes the commonly recognized ""sciatica"" pain that shoots down a lower extremity. This condition can be preceded by a localized low-back aching. Sciatica pain can follow a ""popping"" sensation at onset and be accompanied by numbness and tingling. The pain commonly increases with movements at the waist and can increase with ''coughing'' or ''sneezing''. In more severe instances, lumbar radiculopathy can be accompanied by ''incontinence'' of the bladder and/or bowels.' "
"How do health care professionals diagnose degenerative disc disease, radiculopathy, and sciatica?","'Degenerative disc disease, radiculopathy, and sciatica are suspected when the symptoms described above are noted. The doctor can sometimes detect signs of irritated nerves during the examination. For example, increased radiating pain when the lower extremity is lifted supports the diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy. Nerve testing (''EMG''/''electromyogram'' and NCV/nerve conduction velocity) of the lower extremities can be used to detect the nerve irritation. Health care professionals can visualize degenerative spondylosis using plain film X-ray imaging of the spine, CAT, or MRI scanning. The actual disc herniation can be detected with radiology testing, such as CAT or MRI scanning.' "
"What is the treatment for degenerative disc disease, radiculopathy, and sciatica?","'The treatment of degenerative disc disease, radiculopathy, and sciatica ranges from nonsurgical (medical) management to surgery. Medical management of radiculopathy includes patient education of the condition, medications to relieve pain (''NSAIDs'', analgesics) and muscles spasm (muscle relaxants), ''cortisone injection'' around the spinal cord (epidural injection), physical therapy (heat, exercises, ''massage'', ''ultrasound'', electrical stimulation), chiropractic manipulation and rest (not strict bed rest, but avoiding reinjury). With unrelenting pain, severe impairment of function, or incontinence (which can indicate spinal cord irritation), surgery may be necessary. The operation performed depends on the overall status of the spine and the age and health of the patient. Procedures include removal of the ''herniated disc'' with laminotomy (producing a small hole in the bone of the spine surrounding the spinal cord), laminectomy (removal of the bony wall adjacent to the nerve tissues), by needle technique through the skin (percutaneous discectomy), disc-dissolving procedures (chemonucleolysis), and others.'  "
What is bony encroachment and spinal stenosis?,"'Any condition that results in movement or growth of the bony vertebrae of the spine can limit the space (encroachment) for the adjacent spinal cord and nerves. Causes of bony encroachment of the spinal nerves include foramen narrowing (narrowing of the portal through which the spinal nerve passes from the spinal column, out of the spinal canal to the body), ''spondylolisthesis'' (slipping of one vertebra relative to another), and spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal causing by compression of the nerve roots or spinal cord by bony spurs or other soft tissues in the spinal canal). For example, lumbar ''spinal nerve compression'' in these conditions can lead to sciatica pain that radiates down the lower extremities.'""Spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) can occur at any level of the spine, but it's most common in the lumbar spine of the low back. Symptoms depend on the level affected. For example, ""'lumbar spinal stenosis'' can cause lower-extremity pains that worsen with ''walking'' and are relieved by resting (mimicking poor circulation of the lower extremities).''Treatment of these conditions varies (depending on the severity and condition of the patient) from rest to epidural cortisone injection and surgical decompression by removing the bone that is compressing the nervous tissue.' "
"What is the outlook (prognosis) of degenerative disc disease, radiculopathy, and sciatica?","'The outlook of degenerative disc disease, radiculopathy, and sciatica depends on the severity of the condition, its precise cause, and the interventions used to treat the patient. When patients respond to conservative treatments, the result can be complete healing. Surgical repairs can require postoperative rehabilitation, including physical therapy.' "
"Is it possible to prevent degenerative disc disease, radiculopathy, and sciatica?","'Avoiding injury can prevent degenerative spondylosis and resulting nerve irritation. When the disease already exists, aggravation of existing symptoms can be avoided by limiting stressing or overusing the involved spine.' "
What is de Quervain's tenosynovitis?,"""De Quervain's tenosynovitis is inflammation of tendons on the side of the wrist at the base of the thumb. These tendons include the extensor pollicis brevis and the abductor pollicis longus tendons, which extend the joints of the thumb."" "
What are causes and risk factors of de Quervain's tenosynovitis?,"""De Quervain's tenosynovitis can be brought on by simple strain injury to the extensor pollicis longus and abductor pollicis tendons (tendinitis). Often this form of tendinitis is a result of repetitive motion injury. Typical causes of de Quervain's tenosynovitis include stresses such as lifting young children into car seats, lifting heavy grocery ""'bags'' by the loops, and lifting gardening pots up and into place.'""Risk factors for de Quervain's tenosynovitis include the following:"" Being female Age over 40 African ethnicity/descent Pregnancy"
What are signs and symptoms of de Quervain's tenosynovitis?,"""De Quervain's tenosynovitis causes symptoms of ""'pain'' and tenderness at the side of the wrist beneath the base of the thumb. Sometimes there is slight swelling and redness in the area.'  "
What tests do physicians use to diagnose de Quervain's tenosynovitis?,"""De Quervain's tenosynovitis is diagnosed based on the typical appearance, location of ""'pain'"", and tenderness of the affected wrist. De Quervain's tenosynovitis is usually associated with pain when the thumb is folded across the palm and the fingers are flexed over the thumb as the hand is flexed down toward the little finger away from the involved wrist area. (This is referred to as the Finkelstein maneuver.) ""'X-rays'"" and other imaging tests are usually not needed to diagnose de Quervain's tenosynovitis.""  "
What specialties of doctors treat de Quervain's tenosynovitis?,"""De Quervain's tenosynovitis is commonly diagnosed and treated by primary care physicians (PCPs), including general practitioners, family medicine physicians, and internists. Specialists who treat de Quervain's tenosynovitis include orthopedic surgeons, sports-medicine doctors, and ""'rheumatologists'"". Occupational therapists and physical therapists can be involved in the care of patients with de Quervain's tenosynovitis."" "
What is the treatment for de Quervain's tenosynovitis?,"""Treatments for de Quervain's tenosynovitis includes any combination of rest, splinting, ice, anti-inflammation medication, and/or ""'cortisone injection''. Cortisone injection is extremely effective and is generally the optimal treatment. Normal activity may be resumed within three weeks after an injection. Surgery to release the tendon sheath is only rarely necessary and usually reserved for persisting inflammation after failure of at least one cortisone injection.'  "
Are there home remedies for de Quervain's tenosynovitis?,"""De Quervain's tenosynovitis can initially be treated with home remedies, including ""'cold'' packs, resting, and ''over-the-counter'' medications, such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil'') and ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''). Care must be taken to avoid reinjuring the strained tendon at the wrist. For example, young mothers must be very careful about lifting their children without straining the involved side of the wrist.' "
What is the prognosis with de Quervain's tenosynovitis?,"""The prognosis for de Quervain's tenosynovitis is excellent. The patient can generally return to full function after the inflammation quiets down with treatment. Sometimes bracing is used during future activities that involve repetitive wrist motion."" "
Is it possible to prevent de Quervain's tenosynovitis?,"""De Quervain's tenosynovitis can be prevented by avoiding activities that ""'stress'' the wrist and avoiding repetitive motion injuries.' "
What are forms of hearing loss?,"'Hearing loss'', or deafness, can be present at birth (congenital), or become evident later in life (acquired). The distinction between acquired and congenital deafness specifies only the time that the deafness appears. It does not specify whether the cause of the deafness is genetic (''inherited'').''Acquired deafness may or may not be genetic. For example, it may be a manifestation of a delayed-onset form of genetic deafness. Alternatively, acquired deafness may be due to damage to the ear due to noise or from other conditions.''Congenital deafness may or may not be genetic. In non-genetic causes, congenital deafness may be due to a condition or infection to which the mother was exposed during ''pregnancy'', such as the ''rubella'' virus. Alternatively, congenital hearing loss may be associated with certain other characteristic findings. Fore example, a white forelock may be a sign of a ''genetic disease'' called Waardenburg syndrome that includes congenital deafness in the spectrum of disease. Overall, more than half of congenital hearing loss is inherited.\xa0' "
What are the types of hearing loss?,"'Hearing loss can also be classified based on which portions of the hearing system (auditory system) are affected. When the nervous system is affected, it is referred to as sensorineural hearing loss. When the portions of the ear that are responsible for transmitting the sound to the nerves are affected, it is referred to as conductive hearing loss.''Conditions affecting the cochlea, eighth cranial nerve, spinal cord, or brain cause ''sensorineural hearing loss''. Examples include:''Conditions that affect the ear canal, eardrum (tympanic membrane), and middle ear lead to ''conductive hearing loss''. Examples of conductive hearing loss include:'   Meniere's disease, noise-induced hearing loss (such as prolonged or excessive exposure to loud music or machinery), hearing loss of aging (presbycusis), nerve injury from syphilis, hearing loss of unknown cause (idiopathic hearing loss), nerve tumors and; drug toxicity (such as aspirin and aminoglycosides). ear wax blocking the ear canal, otitis media and; otosclerosis."
What are the symptoms of hearing loss?,"'Symptoms of hearing loss include mild loss of high frequency hearing, hearing loss associated with ringing or noises (''tinnitus''), and complete deafness. Symptoms may develop gradually over time with many causes of hearing loss.''People who are experiencing hearing loss may refrain from taking part in conversations, may turn the volume up high on the radio or TV, and may frequently ask others to repeat what they have said. '  "
What is the treatment for hearing loss?,"'The treatment of hearing loss depends on its cause. For example:'   Ear wax can be removed Ear infection can be treated with medications Diseases that cause inflammation of the ear can be treated with 
	medication Medications that are toxic to the ear can be avoided 
  Occasionally surgical procedures are necessary"
Introduction to sudden cardiac arrest,"""A natural disaster hits, the power goes off and the lights go out. It's a common scene that plays out during hurricane and tornado seasons, and it's very similar in trying to explain ""'sudden cardiac arrest''. The ''heart'"" sustains an insult, the electricity is short circuited, the heart can't pump, and the body dies.""'The heart is an electrical pump, where the electricity is generated in special ''pacemaker'' cells in the upper chamber, or ''atrium'', of the heart. This electrical spark is carried through pathways in the heart so that all the muscle cells contract at once and produce a heart beat. This pumps blood through the heart valves and into all the organs of the body so that they can do their work.'""This mechanism can break down in a variety of ways, but the final pathway in sudden death is the same: the electrical system is irritated and fails to produce electrical activity that causes the heart to beat. The heart muscle can't supply blood to the body, particularly the brain, and the body dies. Ventricular ""'fibrillation'' (V Fib) is the most common reason for sudden death in patients. Without a coordinated electrical signal, the bottom chambers of the heart (ventricles) stop beating and instead, jiggle like Jello. Ventricular Fibrillation is treated with electrical ''shock'', but for it to be effective, the shock usually needs to happen within less than four to six minutes, not only for it to be effective, but also to minimize ''brain damage'' from lack of blood and oxygen supply. Automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) are commonly available in public places to allow almost anybody to treat sudden death. Less commonly, the heart can just stop beating. The absence of a heart beat is known as asystole (asystole: a=no + systole=beat).'  "
What are the causes of sudden cardiac arrest?,"'Sudden death is most often caused by ''heart disease''. When blood vessels narrow, the heart muscle can become irritated because of lack of blood supply. In ''heart attack'' (''acute myocardial infarction''), a blood vessel becomes completely blocked by a ''blood clot'', and there is enough irritability of the muscle to cause ventricular fibrillation. In fact, the reason many people with ''chest pain'' are admitted to the hospital is to monitor their heart rate and rhythm for signs that might lead to ventricular fibrillation. Sudden death may also be the first sign or symptom of ''heart disease''.''Congestive heart failure'' and heart valve problems, like ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the ''aortic valve'') also increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest.''Cardiomyopathy'' is a broad category of ''heart disease'"" where the heart muscle does not contract properly for whatever reason. Often it is ischemic, where part of the heart muscle doesn't get an adequate blood supply for a prolonged period of time and no longer can efficiently pump blood. People whose ejection fractions (the amount of blood pumped out of the heart with each heart beat) is less than 30% are at greater risk for sudden death (a normal ejection fraction is above 50%). In some people, ""'cardiomyopathy'' may develop in the absence of ischemic heart disease.''Inflammation of the heart muscle, known as ''myocarditis'' (myo=muscle + card=heart + itis= inflammation), can also cause rhythm disturbances. Diseases like ''sarcoidosis'', ''amyloidosis'', and infections can cause inflammation of the heart muscle. ''Some people are born with electrical conducting systems that are faulty, which place them at higher risk for rhythm disturbances. Some are due to the wiring, or electrical conduction system, like ''Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome'', while others are due to the structural basic structural problems within the heart, like ''Marfan syndrome''.''Pulmonary embolus or a ''blood clot'"" to the lung, can also cause sudden death. Clots form in the leg or arm and may break off and flow to the lung where they decrease the lung's ability to get oxygen from the air to the body. Risk factors for ""'blood clots'' include surgery, prolonged immobilization (for example, hospitalization, long car rides or plane trips), ''trauma'', or certain diseases like ''cancer''.''Blunt chest trauma, such is in a motor vehicle accident, may result in ventricular fibrillation. (please see commotio cordis below)' "
What about sudden cardiac arrest in the young?,"'In younger people, sudden death is a rare event, but since it often involves people involved in athletics, cases are often reported in the press. The most common cause is ''hypertrophic cardiomyopathy'' (hypertrophy=to grow abnormally large + cardio=heart + myopathy = diseased muscle). This disease is often hereditary, and the walls of the ventricle are larger than they should be. This makes the pumping chamber of the heart smaller, and the heart has to work harder to pump blood out of the heart. As well, the thickened muscle narrows the space for the blood to flow through the aortic valve and to the rest of the body. During ''exercise'', this decreased blood flow can irritate the heart muscle itself and cause ventricular fibrillation, collapse, and sudden death.''Anomalous coronary arteries can also cause sudden death in the young. The heart is a muscle itself, and like any muscle, it needs blood supply to provide oxygen for it to work. Normally, the coronary arteries lie on the surface of the heart. Anomalous arteries dive into the heart muscle itself and may be occluded when the heart muscle that surrounds the abnormally placed artery squeezes aggressively, as with ''exercise'', shutting off blood supply to part of the heart. This irritates the electrical system and can cause ventricular fibrillation and sudden death.''The pre-participation athletic physical examination is a useful tool to screen children andadolescents for their risk of sudden cardiac arrest.''Commotio cordis is a situation in which the heart stops when the chest is hit by an object. News stories occasionally report of baseball players who are hit in the chest by a ball and collapse because their heart stops beating. The heart sits behind the breastbone, and the electrical system can be short circuited when a direct blow is sustained. ' "
What are the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest?,"'Cardiac arrest symptoms and signs are not subtle:'   The heart stops beating and blood is not supplied to the body.  Almost immediate loss of consciousness occurs, and the affected person will not be able to be aroused. 
	 The person will fall or slump over.  No pulse will is felt (palpable). There will be no signs of breathing."
How is sudden cardiac arrest diagnosed?,'Sudden cardiac arrest is an unexpected death in a person who had no known previous diagnosis of a fatal disease or condition. The person may or may not have heart disease.' 
What is the treatment for sudden cardiac arrest?,"'The vast majority of people whose heart stops beating unexpectedly have ventricular fibrillation. The definitive treatment for this is ''defibrillation'' using electricity to shock the heart back into a regular rhythm. With technological advances, AEDs are now a routine sight wherever people congregate.''Communities which institute public CPR education, use of AEDs, and rapid activation of 911 emergency medical services have dramatically increased survival rates from sudden cardiac arrest. Unfortunately, because the brain is so sensitive to the lack of oxygen and blood flow, unless treatment occurs within four to six minutes, there is a high risk of some permanent brain damage.''Should the patient survive to be transported to the hospital, the reason for collapse and sudden death will need to be diagnosed. Regardless, the ABCs of resuscitation will be re-evaluated. ''A''irway, ''B''reathing, and ''C''irculation (heart beat and ''blood pressure'') will be supported, and admission to an intensive care unit is most likely.''Diagnostic tests may include repeated electrocardiograms (EKGs), ''echocardiogram'' (ultrasounds of the heart), and ''cardiac catheterization'' and electrophysiologic studies, in which the electrical pathways of the heart are mapped.''Recent research involving the treatment of survivors of cardiac arrest suggests that prompt institution of ''hypothermia'' (cooling of the body) may prevent or lessen the degree of ''brain injury''. ''Survivors of sudden cardiac arrest are often candidates for ''implantable cardiac defibrillators''.' "
Can sudden cardiac arrest be prevented?,"'Death is best treated by ''prevention''. Most sudden death is associated with heart disease, so the at-risk population remains males older than 40 years of age who smoke, have ''high blood pressure'', and ''diabetes'' (the risk factors for heart attack). Other risks include ''syncope'' (''fainting'' or loss of consciousness) and known heart disease.'""Syncope, or loss of consciousness, is a significant risk factor for sudden death. While some reasons for passing out are benign, there is always a concern that the reason was an abnormal heart rhythm that subsequently spontaneously corrected. The fear is that the next episode will be a sudden cardiac arrest. Depending on the healthcare provider's suspicion based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and ""'EKG'', the healthcare practitioner may recommend inpatient or outpatient heart monitoring to try to find a clue as to whether the passing out was due to a deadly heart rhythm. Unfortunately, the potentially suspect rhythm may not recur and depending on the situation, prolonged outpatient monitoring lasting weeks and months may be necessary. Use of electrophysiologic testing may help identify high risk patients (the electrical pathways are mapped using techniques similar to heart catheterization).''In people with symptoms of ''chest pain'', aside from making the diagnosis, monitoring both the heart rate and rhythm are emphasized. The purpose of watching people with chest ''pain'' in a hospital setting is to prevent sudden cardiac arrest.''Using implantable defibrillators in high risk patients, especially those with markedly decreased ejection fractions can reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest. These devices are placed under the skin in the chest wall and have wires that are attached to the heart itself. When they detect ventricular fibrillation, a shock is automatically delivered to the heart, restoring a heart beat and averting sudden death.' "
What is the prognosis for sudden cardiac arrest?,"'The frequency of sudden cardiac arrest is related to the frequency of ''coronary artery disease''. If public health initiatives work to decrease risk the factors for heart disease, the risk for sudden death should decrease as well. ''In the adolescent population, increased awareness of hypertrophic ''cardiomyopathy'' and appropriate screening may decrease the frequency of sudden death.''Public education and widespread availability of AEDs will increase survival.' "
Introduction to Heart Valve Surgery,'Diseased ''heart'' valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and non-surgically (balloon valvuloplasty).' 
What Happens During Traditional Heart Valve Surgery?,"'During traditional heart valve surgery, a surgeon will make an incision down the center of your sternum (breastbone) to get direct access to your heart. The surgeon then repairs or replaces your abnormal heart valve or valves.'  "
What Happens During Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery?,"'Minimally invasive heart valve surgery is a type of surgery performed through smaller incisions. This type of surgery reduces blood loss, ''trauma'', and length of hospital stay.''Your surgeon will review your diagnostic tests prior to your surgery to determine if you are a candidate for minimally invasive valve surgery.''Often, the surgeon and cardiologist (heart doctor) will use transesophogeal echo (an ''ultrasound'' transducer probe that is passed down the throat) to help determine the functioning of the valve before and after surgery.' "
What Is Heart Valve Repair Surgery?,"'The ''mitral valve'' is the most commonly repaired heart valve, but the aortic, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques. The valves are made up of leaflets or flaps.''If your valve can be repaired, your surgeon will perform any of the following types of valve repair procedures.''The advantages of heart valve repair surgery include:' Commissurotomy. Fused valve leaflets, or flaps, are separated to widen the valve opening. Decalcification. Calcium deposits are removed to allow the leaflets to be more flexible and close properly. Reshape leaflets. If one of the leaflets is floppy, a segment may be cut out and the leaflet sewn back together, allowing the valve to close more tightly. This procedure is called quadrangular resection. Chordal transfer. If a leaflet of the mitral valve has prolapse (floppy; lacking support), the chordae are transferred from one leaflet to the other. Then, the leaflet where the chordae was removed is repaired by quandrangular resection (see above). Annulus support. If the valve annulus (the ring of tissue supporting the valve) is too wide, it may be reshaped or tightened by sewing a ring structure around the annulus. The ring may be made of tissue or synthetic material. Patched leaflets. The surgeon may use tissue patches to repair any leaflets with tears or holes. decreased need for life-long blood thinner (anticoagulant) medication preserved heart muscle strength"
What If My Valves Cannot Be Repaired?,"'When you have aortic or pulmonic ''heart valve disease'', valve replacement surgery is usually performed. In some cases, the ''aortic valve'' can be repaired.''During valve replacement surgery, the faulty valve is removed and a new valve is sewn to the annulus of your original valve. The new valve can be a:' Mechanical valve. It is made totally of mechanical parts that are tolerated well by the body. The bi-leaflet valve is used most often. It consists of two carbon leaflets in a ring covered with polyester knit fabric. Biological valve. Tissue valves (also called biologic or bioprosthetic valves) are made of human or animal tissue. Animal tissue heart valves may come from pig tissue (porcine) or cow tissue (bovine). Tissue valves may have some artificial parts to help give the valve support and to aid placement. Homograft valve (also called allograft). It is an aortic or pulmonic human valve that has been removed from a donated human heart, preserved, and frozen under sterile conditions. A homograft may be used to replace a diseased aortic or pulmonic valve."
What Are the Pros and Cons of Each Type of Heart Valve?," Mechanical heart valves. The advantage to mechanical heart valves is their sturdiness. They are designed to last for many years. There are also drawbacks. Due to the artificial material involved, people who receive these valves will need to take life-long blood-thinner medication (anticoagulants) to prevent clots from forming in the mechanical valve. These clots can increase the risk for a stroke. Also, some people report a valve ticking sound that is usually not bothersome. It is the sound of the valve leaflets opening and closing. Biological heart valves. The advantage of biological heart valves is that most people do not need to take life-long blood thinners, unless they have other conditions (such as atrial fibrillation) that warrant it. Biologic valves, traditionally, were not considered as durable as mechanical valves, especially in younger people. Previously available biologic valves usually needed to be replaced after about 10 years. However, some studies show that some biologic valves may last at least 17 years without decline in function. This represents a new milestone in the durability of biologic valves. Homograft heart valves. Homografts are ideal heart valves for aortic valve replacement, especially when the aortic root is diseased or there is infection. The heart's natural anatomy is preserved and patients do not need to take life-long blood thinners. However, the limited availability is a drawback in some settings."
Are There Non-Surgical Options for Valve Disease?,"'Yes. Balloon valvotomy is used to increase the opening of a narrowed (stenotic) heart valve. It is used for select patients who have mitral valve stenosis (narrowing of the mitral valve) with symptoms, select older people who have ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the aortic valve) but are not able to undergo surgery, and some patients with pulmonic stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonic valve).' "
What Happens During Balloon Valvotomy?,"'During a balloon valvotomy, a specially designed catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and guided to the heart. The tip is directed inside the narrowed heart valve. Once there, a tiny balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening. Once the cardiologist is satisfied the valve has been widened enough, the balloon is removed.''During the procedure, the cardiologist may perform an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound of the heart'') to get a better picture of the valve.''New research-based, non-surgical procedures to treat regurgitation (leaky valves) are being tested and may provide additional treatment options using a catheter for valve disease in the future.' "
Deep brain stimulation introduction,"'Deep brain stimulation (or DBS) is a way to inactivate parts of the brain that cause '""Parkinson's""' disease and its associated symptoms without purposefully destroying the brain. In deep brain stimulation, electrodes are placed in the thalamus (to treat essential ''tremor'' and ''multiple sclerosis'"") or in the globus pallidus (for Parkinson's disease).""'In deep brain stimulation electrodes are connected by wires to a type of ''pacemaker'' device (called an impulse generator, or IPG) implanted under the skin of the chest, below the collarbone. Once activated, the device sends continuous electrical pulses to the target areas in the brain, blocking the impulses that cause ''tremors''. This has the same effect as thalamotomy or pallidotomy surgeries without actually destroying parts of the brain.''The IPG can easily be programmed using a computer that sends radio signals to the device. Patients are given special magnets or other devices so they can externally turn the IPG on or off.''Depending on use, the stimulators may last three to five years. The IPG replacement procedure is relatively simple.''' "
How Does Deep Brain Stimulation Work?,'Experts are unclear how deep brain stimulation works.' 
How Is Deep Brain Stimulation Performed?,"""Patients who are having stimulators placed on both sides of the brain will have their surgery divided into two parts. Most people with Parkinson's disease will require the surgery be done on both sides of the brain. During the first surgery, the electrodes are placed into the brain, but left unconnected.""'There are several ways in which the electrodes are placed into the target areas of the brain. First these areas must be located. One way to locate the target areas is to rely only on a computed tomography (CT) or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') scan. While some surgeons stop there, others use an electrode recording technique to map and target the specific areas that they will need to reach.''Once the correct location is identified, the permanent electrodes are implanted. The loose ends are placed underneath the skin of the head and the incision is closed with ''sutures''. The patient receives general anesthesia for the placement of the impulse generator in the chest and the positioning of extension wires that connect the electrodes to the impulse generators. It may take a few weeks until the simulators and medications are adjusted sufficiently for patients receive adequate symptom relief. But, overall, DBS causes very few side effects.' "
What Is Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation?,"'Subthalamic nucleus stimulation is a new application of the original deep brain stimulation technique. After extensive ''clinical trials'"", stimulation of the part of the brain called the subthalamic nucleus has been recognized as the most effective surgical treatment for Parkinson's disease, addressing not only ""'tremors'"", but the full range of the disease's symptoms, including: rigidity, slowness of movement, ""'stiffness'', and ''walking'' concerns.''Successful stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus allows patients to consistently reduce their medication while improving all of their other disease-related symptoms. In addition, the surgery to place the stimulator in the subthalamic nucleus is generally easier than surgeries for the thalamus or globus pallidus.' "
What Are the Advantages of Deep Brain Stimulation?,"'Deep brain stimulation has many advantages.''Possible Disadvantages:' First, it does not require purposeful destruction of any part of the brain and therefore, has fewer complications than thalamotomy and pallidotomy. In addition, the electrical stimulation is adjustable and can be changed as the person's disease changes or his or her response to medications change. No further surgery is necessary to make the adjustments. Another significant advantage of deep brain stimulation relates to future treatments. Destructive surgery, such as thalamotomy or pallidotomy, may reduce the person's potential to benefit from future therapies. For example, future brain cell transplantation may be of great help to people with Parkinson's disease. There is concern that a pallidotomy or thalamotomy may prevent patients from benefiting from brain cell transplantation. This would not be the case with deep brain stimulation, as the stimulator could be turned off. Deep brain stimulation is a relatively safe procedure. The procedure can treat all the major symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Daily living tasks and quality of life are also improved. With subthalamic nucleus stimulation, medications can usually be reduced. The stimulator can also be turned off at any time if deep brain stimulation is causing excessive side effects. Increased risk of infection. The implantation of any foreign object in the body carries that risk. Additional surgery may be needed if the equipment stops working or for battery replacement. Additional time on the part of the patient and health care provider to program device and adjust medications. Device may interfere with anti-theft devices, refrigerator door magnets."
How Effective Is Deep Brain Stimulation?,"""With deep brain stimulation, the vast majority of people (over 70%) experience a significant improvement of all their symptoms related to Parkinson's disease. Most people are able to significantly reduce their medications."" "
What Kinds of Movement Problems Are Helped by Deep Brain Stimulation?,"""Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus is effective for all major symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as ""'tremor'', slowness of movement, rigidity, and problems with walking and balance. People bothered by involuntary movements such as ''dyskinesia'' often experience a marked reduction of these involuntary movements primarily because they are able to reduce their medications following surgery.'""Deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus is effective for a wide range of Parkinson's symptoms. It seems to be somewhat less effective for problems with walking and balance. Also, patients remain on the same average dose of medications following surgery.""""Deep brain stimulation of the thalamus is only effective for tremor and rigidity. Consequently, deep brain stimulation of the thalamus is usually not performed for patients with Parkinson's disease."" "
What Are the Risks of Deep Brain Stimulation?,"'As with any surgical procedure, there are risks. There is a 2%-3% risk of a serious and permanent complication such as ''paralysis'', changes in thinking, memory and personality, ''seizures'', and infection. Talk to your doctor to see if these risks apply to you.' "
Is Deep Brain Stimulation Experimental,"""No. Deep brain stimulation is not experimental. DBS of the thalamus was approved by the FDA for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and essential tremor in 1997. But, since stimulation of the thalamus is only effective for treating tremor and rigidity symptoms, it is not recommended for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This is because even if a person currently only has tremor or rigidity, he or she will eventually develop other symptoms that would only be helped by stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus. Therefore, stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus is recommended."" "
Who Should Consider Deep Brain Stimulation?,"'There are many important issues to be addressed when considering deep brain stimulation. These issues should be discussed with a movement disorders expert or a specially trained ''neurologist''. A movement disorders expert is someone who has trained specifically in movement disorders.''One of the most important criteria is that the person has had an adequate trial of medications. Surgery is not recommended if medications can adequately control the disease. However, surgery should be considered for people who do not achieve satisfactory control with ''drugs''. Talk to your doctor to see if DBS is right for you.' "
Is Age a Factor in Deep Brain Stimulation?,"'Deep brain stimulation has been successful in treating people of different ages. However, each person should be assessed individually as to their stamina and overall health before considering surgery.' "
Where Should the Procedure be Performed?,"'The first and most important recommendation is that the deep brain stimulation procedure be performed in a place where there is a multi-disciplinary team of experts. This means neurologists, neurosurgeons, and neurophysiologists who have experience and specialized training in performing these types of surgeries.''The next important consideration is how the surgery is done. Different centers may perform the procedure in different ways. It is very important to ask how the target (the thalamus or globus pallidus) is targeted. It is clear that the chances of benefit and the risks of complications are directly related to how close the electrode is to the correct target.' "
Will I Be Asleep During the Deep Brain Stimulation Procedure?,'You will remain awake during most of the deep brain stimulation procedure. This allows the surgical team to interact with you when testing the effects of the stimulation. Small amounts of local anesthetic (''pain''-relieving medication) are given in sensitive areas. The vast majority of people experience minimal discomfort during the procedure.' 
What Should I Expect After Deep Brain Stimulation?,"'You may feel tired and sore but will be given medication and kept comfortable after your deep brain stimulation procedure. Also, you may have irritation or soreness around the ''stitches'' and pin sites.''As with any surgery, there are some guidelines and limitations that you should follow after DBS. Be sure to discuss these with your doctor and ask questions before surgery. Understanding what you will be experiencing and knowing what to expect afterward can help ease some of the natural ''anxiety'' that comes with any medical procedure.' "
When Will I Be Able to Go Home After the Deep Brain Stimulation Procedure?,"'The average hospital stay for the first part of the deep brain stimulation surgery is two to three days. For the second part of the surgery one week later, you will be in the hospital for less than 24 hours.' "
How Should I Care for the Surgical Area Once I Am Home?," Your stitches or staples will be removed seven to 10 days after surgery. Each of the pin sites should be kept covered with band-aids until they are dry. These should be changed every day as necessary. You will be able to wash your head with a damp cloth, avoiding the surgical area. You may shampoo your hair the day after your stitches or staples are removed, but only very gently. You should not scratch or irritate the wound areas."
Will I Have to Limit Activity Following Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery?," You should not engage in light activities for two weeks after deep brain stimulation surgery. This includes housework and sexual activity. You should not engage in heavy activities for four to six weeks after surgery. This includes jogging, swimming, or any physical education classes. Anything strenuous should be avoided to allow your surgical wound to heal properly. If you have any questions about activities, call your doctor before performing them. You should not lift more than five pounds for at least two weeks. Depending on the type of work you do, you may return to work within four to six weeks."
Post Surgery Warning:,'Call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms after deep brain stimulation surgery:' Severe and persistent headaches Bleeding from your incision Redness or increased swelling in the area of the incision Loss of vision A sudden change in vision A persistent fever or chills
Can I Use Electrical Devices?,"'While you should be able to use most electronic devices, you should be aware that:''WebMD Medical Reference' Some devices, such as theft detectors and screening devices, like those found in airports, department stores and public libraries, can cause your neurotransmitter to switch on or off. Usually, this only causes an uncomfortable sensation. However, your symptoms could get worse suddenly. Always carry the identification card given to you. With this, you may request assistance to bypass those devices. You will be able to use home appliances, computers, and cell phones. They do not usually interfere with your implanted stimulator. You will be provided with a magnet to activate and deactivate your stimulator. This magnet may damage televisions, credit cards, and computer discs. Always keep it at least one foot away from these items."
What is deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,"'Deep vein thrombosis'' or ''DVT'"" describes a blood clot (thrombosis) that forms in the deep veins located in the arm or leg. It is important to know the body's anatomy and function to understand why clots form in veins and why they can be dangerous."" Arteries have thin muscles within their walls to be able to withstand the pressure of the heart pumping blood to the far reaches of the body. Veins don't have a significant muscle lining, and there is nothing pumping blood back to the heart except physiology. Blood returns to the heart because the body's large muscles squeeze the veins as they contract in their normal activity of moving the body. The normal activities of moving the body returns the blood back to the heart. Being mobile causes this blood return system to fail, and the resulting stagnated blood may clot. There are two types of veins in the arm or leg; superficial veins and deep veins. Superficial veins lie just below the skin and are easily seen on the surface. Deep veins, as their name implies, are located deep within the muscles of the extremity. Blood flows from the superficial veins into the deep venous system through small perforator veins. Superficial and perforator veins have one-way valves within them that allow blood to flow only in the direction of the heart when the veins are squeezed. A blood clot (thrombus) in the deep venous system of the leg or arm, in itself, is not dangerous. It becomes potentially life threatening when a piece of the blood clot breaks off and embolizes, travels through the circulation system through the heart, and enters into one of the pulmonary arteries and becomes lodged. This can prevent blood from flowing properly through the lung and decreasing the amount of oxygen absorbed and distributed back to the body. Diagnosis and treatment of a DVT is meant to prevent pulmonary embolism. Blood clots in the superficial veins do not pose a danger of causing pulmonary emboli because the perforator vein valves act as a sieve to prevent clots from entering the deep venous system. They are usually not at risk of causing pulmonary embolism."
7 early warning signs and symptoms of DVT,"'The signs and symptoms of DVT are related to obstruction of blood returning to the heart and causing a backup of blood in the leg. Classic symptoms include:''You may or may not have all of these symptoms, or your may have none. The symptoms of the condition may mimic an infection or ''cellulitis'' of the arm or leg.'""In the past, doctors and other healthcare professionals performed simple tests on patients to make a diagnosis of a blood clot in the leg; however, they have not been effective. For example, pulling the patient's toes toward the nose (Homans' sign), and squeezing the calf to produce pain (Pratt's sign). Today, doctors and health care professionals usually do not rely upon whether these signs and symptoms are present to make the diagnosis or decide that you have DVT."" Pain Swelling Warmth Redness Leg cramps, often starting in the calf Leg pain that worsens when bending the foot Bluish or whitish skin discoloration"
What are the signs and symptoms of superficial blood clots?,"'Blood clots in the superficial vein system (closer to the surface of the skin), most often occur due to ''trauma'' to the vein, which causes a small blood clot to form. Inflammation of the vein and surrounding skin causes the symptoms similar to any other type of inflammation, for example,''You often can feel the vein as a firm, thickened cord. There may be inflammation that follows the course of part of the leg vein. Although there is inflammation, there is no infection.''Varicosities ''can predispose to superficial thrombophlebitis and ''varicose veins''. This occurs when the valves of the larger veins in the superficial system fail (the greater and lesser saphenous veins), which allows blood to back up and cause the veins to swell and become distorted or tortuous. The valves fail when veins lose their elasticity and stretch. This can be due to age, prolonged standing, ''obesity'', ''pregnancy'', and genetic factors.'   Redness Warmth Tenderness Swelling"
How do you get deep vein thrombosis?,"'Blood is meant to flow. If it becomes stagnant, there is a potential for it to clot. The blood in veins constantly forms microscopic clots that are routinely broken down by the body. If the balance of clot formation and clot breakdown is altered, significant clotting may occur. A thrombus can form if one or a combination of the following situations.'   Prolonged travel and sitting, such as long airplane flights (""economy class syndrome""), car, or train travel Hospitalization Surgery Trauma to the lower leg with or without surgery or casting Pregnancy, including 6-8 weeks post-partum after delivery of the baby Obesity Medications such as birth control pills (oral contraceptives), for example, Ortho-Novum, Yaz, Yasmin, Microgestin, Kelnor, and other estrogens Smoking Genetic or hereditary predisposition to clot formation Increased number of red blood cells (Polycythemia) Cancer Trauma to the vein Fracture to the leg or arm Bruised leg or arm Complication of an invasive procedure of the vein"
What are the risk factors for DVT?,"'Many people are at risk for developing blood clots, for example:' Immobility, including prolonged bed rest due to illness or injury and long travel in a car or airplane Pregnancy Birth control pills or hormone therapy Smoking Cancer Surgery that damages the veins in an arm or leg Family history or genetic predisposition to forming blood clots Obesity"
What tests diagnose DVT?,"'The diagnosis of ''superficial'' thrombophlebitis usually is made by the doctor at the bedside of the patient, based upon history, potential risk factors present, and findings from the physical examination. Further risk stratification tools may include scoring systems that can help decide whether a DVT is likely.''If the probability of a leg thrombosis is low, a D-Dimer blood test may be ordered.''D-Dimer is a blood test that may be used as a screening test to determine if a blood clot exists. D-Dimer is a chemical that is produced when a blood clot in the body gradually dissolves. The test is used as a positive or negative indicator. If the result is negative, then in most cases no blood clot exists. If the D-Dimer test is positive, it does not necessarily mean that a deep vein thrombosis is present since many situations will have an expected positive result. Any bruise or blood clot will result in a positive D-Dimer result (for example, from surgery, a fall, in ''cancer'' or in pregnancy). For that reason, D-Dimer testing must be used selectively.'   If the D-Dimer is negative, then it is unlikely that a DVT is the diagnosis. If the D-dimer is elevated, then the possibility of a DVT exists and an imaging study, usually ultrasound, is required to look for the DVT Ultrasound is the standard method of diagnosing the presence of a deep vein thrombosis. The ultrasound technician may be able to determine whether a clot exists, where it is located in the leg or arm, and how large it is. It also may be possible to know whether the blood clot is new or chronic. If necessary, ultrasounds may be compared over time to see whether a clot has grown or resolved. Ultrasound is better at ""seeing"" the veins above the knee as compared to the small veins below the knee joint. Clots in the chest or pelvis may not be identified on ultrasound. Venography, injecting dye into the veins to look for a thrombus, is not usually performed anymore and has become more of a historical footnote. Other blood testing may be considered based on the potential cause for the deep vein thrombosis."
What are the treatment and management guidelines for DVT? Does it go away?,"'The treatment for deep venous thrombosis is anticoagulation or ""thinning the blood"" with medications.'""The recommended length of treatment for an uncomplicated DVT is three months. Depending upon the patient's situation, underlying medical conditions, and the reason for developing a blood clot, a longer duration of anticoagulation may be required. At three months, the doctor or otherhealth care professional should evaluate the patient in regard to the potential for future blood clot formation.""'If the decision is made to continue with anticoagulation therapy for the long term, the risk/reward for preventing clots versus bleeding risks should be evaluated by your doctor.'  "
What is the treatment of superficial blood clots?,"'Treatment for superficial thrombophlebitis treating the symptoms with:''If the thrombophlebitis occurs near the groin where the superficial and deep systems join together, there is potential that the thrombus could extend into the deep venous system. These patients may require anticoagulation or blood thinning therapy.' Warm compresses Leg compression Anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen (Mortin) or naproxen (Naprocen)."
What are the side effects and risks of anticoagulation therapy?,"'People who take anticoagulation medications are at risk for bleeding. The decision to use these medications must balance the risk and rewards of the treatment. Should bleeding occur, there are strategies available to reverse the anticoagulation effects.''Some people may have contraindications to anticoagulation therapy, for example a patient with bleeding in the brain, major trauma, or recent significant surgery. An alternative may be to place a filter in the inferior vena cava (the major vein that collects blood from both legs) to prevent emboli, should they arise, from reaching the heart and lungs. These filters may be effective but have the potential risk of being the source of new clot formation. An IVC filter is NOT recommended for patients who are also taking anticoagulation medications.' "
8 medications used for the treatment of DVT,"'Anticoagulation prevents further growth of the blood clot and prevents it from forming an embolus that can travel to the lung. The body has a complex mechanism to form blood clots to help repair blood vessel damage. There is a clotting cascade with numerous blood factors that have to be activated for a clot to form. There are difference types of medications that can be used for anticoagulation to treat DVT:''The American College of Chest Physicians has guidelines that give direction as to what medications might best be used in different situations. For example, a patient with a DVT, and no active cancer, treatment with a NOAC would be recommended. If active cancer exists, the treatment of DVT would be with enoxaparin as the drug of first choice.''NOACs work almost immediately to thin the blood and anticoagulate the patient. There is no need for blood tests to monitor dosing. The NOAC medications presently approved for deep vein thrombosis treatment include:'""All four are also indicated to treat pulmonary embolism. They also may be prescribed to patients' anticoagulated with nonvalvular ""'atrial fibrillation'' to prevent ''stroke'' and systemic embolus.' Unfractionated heparin Low molecular weight heparin: enoxaparin (Lovenox) Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) also known as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) Warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) apixaban (Eliquis) rivaroxaban (Xarelto) edoxaban (Savaysa) dabigatran (Pradaxa)"
"Warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven)","'Warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) is an anti-coagulation medication that acts as a ''Vitamin K'' antagonist, blocking blood-clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. Historically, it was a first-line medication for treating blood clots, but its role has been diminished because of the availability of newer ''drugs''. While warfarin may be prescribed immediately after the diagnosis of DVT, it takes up to a week or more for it to reach therapeutic levels in the blood so that the blood is appropriately thinned. Therefore, low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin [Lovenox)] is administered at the same time. Enoxaparin thins the blood almost immediately and is used as a ''bridge'' therapy until the warfarin has taken effect. Enoxaparin injections can be given on an outpatient basis. For those patients who have contraindications to the use of enoxaparin (for example, ''kidney failure'' does not allow the drug to be appropriately metabolized), intravenous heparin can be used as the first step in association with warfarin. This requires admission to the hospital. The dosage of warfarin is monitored by blood tests measuring the prothrombin time (PT), or INR (international normalized ratio).' "
Does DVT require surgery?,"'Surgery is a rare option in treating large deep venous thrombosis of the leg in patients who cannot take blood thinners or who have developed recurrent blood clots while on anti-coagulant medications. The surgery is usually accompanied by placing an IVC (inferior vena cava) filter to prevent future clots from embolizing to the lung.''Phlegmasia Cerulea Dolens describes a situation in which a blood clot forms in the iliac vein of the pelvis and the femoral vein of the leg, obstructing almost all blood return and compromising blood supply to the leg. In this case, surgery may be considered to remove the clot, but the patient will also require anti-coagulant medications. ''Stents'' may also be required to keep a vein open and prevent clotting. May Thurer Syndrome, also known as iliac vein compression syndrome, is a cause of phlegmasia, in which the iliac vein in the pelvis is compressed and a ''stent'' is needed.' "
What are the complications of DVT?,"'Pulmonary embolism is the major complication of deep vein thrombosis. With signs and symptoms such as ''chest pain'' and ''shortness of breath'', it is a life-threatening condition. Most often pulmonary emboli arise from the legs.''Post-phlebitic syndrome can occur after a deep vein thrombosis. The affected leg or arm can become chronically swollen and painful with skin color changes and ulcer formation around the foot and ankle.' "
Can DVT be prevented?,"   Minimize risk factors for DVT; for example, quit smoking (especially if the person also is taking birth control pills or hormone therapy). In the hospital setting, the staff works hard to provide DVT prophylaxis to minimize the potential for clot formation in immobilized patients. Surgery patients are out of bed walking (ambulatory) earlier and low dose heparin or enoxaparin is being used for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis (measures taken to prevent DVT). When traveling, it is recommended that you get up and walk every couple of hours during a long trip."
Which types of doctors treat DVT?,"'People with a swollen extremity or concern that a DVT exists may be cared for by a variety of health-care professionals. Both the primary care provider (including internal medicine and family medicine specialists) and a health care professional at in an urgent care (walk in) clinic or emergency department are able to recognize and diagnose the condition. Some people go to the hospital and the diagnosis is made there.'""Treatment is usually started by the doctor who makes the diagnosis, but long-term treatment decisions, risk stratification, and follow-up usually is be done by the person's primary care doctor. Depending upon the situation, a hematologist (specialist in ""'blood disorders'') may be consulted. If there is need for the clot to be removed or dissolved, an interventional radiologist may also be involved.''Depending upon the medication used to anticoagulate the blood, pharmacists and anticoagulation nurses may also be involved on your treatment team.' "
What are implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs)?,"'An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a small electronic device installed inside the chest to prevent sudden death from cardiac arrest due to life threatening abnormally fast heart rhythms (tachycardias). The ICD is capable of monitoring the heart rhythm. When the heart is beating normally, the device remains inactive. If the heart develops a life-threatening tachycardia, the ICD can attempt pacing to bring the hear rhythm back to normal, or it can deliver an electrical ""''shock''(s)"" to the heart to terminate the abnormal rhythm and return the heart rhythm to normal.' "
How does a normal heart function?,"'The heart is an organ consisting of four chambers that pump blood. The two upper chambers are called the right and left atria, and the two lower chambers called the right and left ventricles. The ''right atrium'' receives venous blood (oxygen-poor blood) from the body and pumps it into the ''right ventricle''. The right ventricle pumps the oxygen-poor blood to the ''lungs'' to receive oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood from the lungs then travels to the ''left atrium'' and is pumped by the left ''atrium'' into the ''left ventricle''. The left ventricle delivers the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. In addition to oxygen, the blood carries other nutrients (glucose, ''electrolytes'', etc.) to the organs.'""In order to keep a body healthy, the heart must deliver a sufficient amount of blood to the body. As a pump, the heart is most efficient in delivering blood when functioning within a certain heart rate range. Normally, the heart's natural ""'pacemaker'' called the SA node (a special tissue located on the right atria wall), keeps the heartbeat (heart rate) in the normal range. Electrical signals generated by the SA node travel along special conduction tissues on the walls of the atria and the ventricles. These electrical signals cause the heart muscles to contract and pump blood in an orderly and efficient manner.' "
How do abnormal heart rhythms decrease blood delivery by the heart?,"'Abnormal heart rhythms'', either too slow or too fast, decrease the delivery of blood by the heart.  Bradycardia is a condition in which the heart rate is too slow. Bradycardias can be due to diseases of the SA node or the conduction tissues of the heart. The slow-beating heart delivers an insufficient amount of blood to the body. ''Tachycardia is a condition in which the heart rate is too rapid. When the heart pumps too fast, the ventricles do not have enough time to fill their chambers with blood before the next contraction. Therefore, tachycardias can decrease the amount of blood delivered to he body. One of the effects of decreased blood delivery to the body is ''low blood pressure''.' "
What is the cause of tachycardias?,'Abnormally fast heart rates are called tachycardias. Tachycardias are caused by rapidly firing electrical signals arising from the walls of the atria or the ventricles. These rapidly firing signals override the signals generated by the SA node and cause the heart to beat too fast.''Tachycardias caused by electrical signals from the atria are called atrial tachycardias. Tachycardias caused by electrical signals from the ventricles are called ventricular tachycardias.' 
What are the symptoms of tachycardias?,'Symptoms of tachycardias include:' Palpitations or fluttering sensations in the heart; Lightheadedness (due to low blood pressure); Fainting spells or loss of consciousness (due to low blood pressure); Fatigue and weakness (due to lack of blood supply); and A flushing sensation.
What are life-threatening tachycardias?,"'Two common life-threatening tachycardias are ventricular tachycardia and ventricular ''fibrillation''. Ventricular tachycardia is a rapid regular rhythm caused by electrical signals originating from an area of the ventricle. Ventricular tachycardia can decrease blood delivery by the heart and cause low ''blood pressure''. Ventricular tachycardia can also progress to a more serious heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation.''Ventricular fibrillation is an irregular rhythm, which is a result of multiple rapid and chaotic electrical signals firing from many different areas in the ventricles. A heart undergoing ventricular fibrillation is in a state of standstill called cardiac arrest. The heart muscles quiver and cease pumping which causes a halt in the delivery of blood to the body. Unless ventricular fibrillation is terminated quickly, irreversible ''brain damage'' occurs within minutes of the onset of ventricular fibrillation, leading to death.''Sudden cardiac arrest'' is the most common cause of death in the United States. The most frequent causes of cardiac arrest in the United States are ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.' "
What are the causes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation?,"'Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are most commonly caused by ''heart attacks'' (acute myocardial infarctions) or scarring of the heart muscle from previous ''heart attacks''. Less common causes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation include severe weakening of the heart muscles (''cardiomyopathy''), medication toxicity (such as ''digoxin'' [''Lanoxin''] toxicity), medication side effects, and blood ''electrolyte'' disturbances (such as a ''low potassium'' level). Ironically, some medications used in treating heart rhythm abnormalities can cause ventricular tachycardias.' "
How can ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation be treated and prevented?,"'Medications have traditionally been used in preventing ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Examples of these medications include ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone'', Nextrone, Pacerone) and ''beta-blockers'' such as ''atenolol'' (''Tenormin''), and ''propranolol'' (''Inderal''). Medicines, however, are not very successful in preventing tachycardias or in terminating tachycardias once they occur.''Once a life threatening tachycardia occurs, the most effective treatment is to administer mild electric shock(s) to the heart to terminate the tachycardia and  reset the heart rhythm to normal.''If a patient is in cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation, the treatment is the delivery of a strong electrical shock to the fibrillating heart without delay. Irreversible brain and other organ damages can occur within minutes if the normal heart rhythm is not restored. Most patients can potentially be saved if shocks are delivered quickly to convert the fibrillation to normal rhythm before irreversible brain damages occur.''The electrical shocks (mild and strong) that terminate ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation can be delivered by an external defibrillator (a portable unit with pads that deliver electrical shocks to the heart), or by an ''implantable cardiac defibrillator'' (ICD).  External defibrillators, however, may not be readily available, and rescuers may not be able to administer effective CPR for long periods before paramedics arrive. Therefore, in patients known to be at risk of developing life-threatening tachycardias, ICDs can be implanted in their chests as a preventive measure to terminate tachycardias and fibrillation and avert cardiac arrest.' "
Who should receive an implantable cardiac defibrillator?,"'Patients at risk of developing sudden cardiac arrests due to ventricular tachycardias and fibrillations are candidates for ICDs. ICDs do not prevent the occurrence of life-threatening rhythms, but can quickly terminate them when they occur. Recent ''clinical trials'' have identified several groups of patients who should receive ICDs. They are:' Patients who have survived cardiac arrest; Patients with ventricular tachycardias that significantly decrease the amount of blood delivered by the heart, resulting in low blood pressure; Patients with significant heart muscle damage from prior a heart attack, and have ventricular tachycardia episodes that are not suppressed by medications; and Patients deemed at high risk for sudden death from cardiac arrest based on a history of heart disease and findings from an echocardiogram and ECG."
How are implantable cardiac defibrillators designed?,"'An ICD consists of one or more leads (conducting wires insulated with silicone or polyurethane) and a defibrillator unit. The defibrillator unit is a small titanium case containing a microchip computer, a capacitor, and a battery.''The leads carry electrical signals between the heart and the defibrillator unit. One end of a lead is placed on the inner wall of the heart while the other end is attached to the defibrillator unit. The leads help the defibrillator unit monitor the natural heart rhythm. The leads also deliver electrical shock(s) from the defibrillator unit to the heart when tachycardias occur.''The microchip computer runs the defibrillator, monitors the natural heart rhythm, instructs the capacitor to send electrical shock(s) when tachycardias occur, determines the strength of the shock(s) sent, and also keeps a record of the heart rhythms as well as the shock(s) sent by the defibrillator.''ICDs have programmable features that allow the doctor to change the cutoff heart rate for activating the defibrillator. Tachycardias with rates higher than the cutoff heart rate activate the firing of shocks by the defibrillator. The doctor can also adjust the strength (amount of energy delivered) of each shock, and the number of shocks delivered with each tachycardia episode.''Most defibrillators now have built-in pacemakers as well. The newer defibrillators can have very sophisticated pacing devices equipped with the ability to pace both the ''atrium'' and the ventricle (dual chamber pacers). Cardioverter defibrillators have rapid pacing capabilities. Rapid pacing can sometimes convert a tachycardia to normal rhythm without administering electric shock(s).''The electric pulses and shocks delivered by the ICDs are of such low energy that they do not harm the patient or family members in physical contact with the patient.' "
How are implantable cardiac defibrillators implanted?,"'Implantation of an ICD is similar to that of a permanent pacemaker. The procedure, which lasts 1-2 hours, is considered minor in that it does not involve major heart surgery. Patients are typically sedated during the procedure. A local anesthetic is injected under the skin over the area where the ICD will be placed, usually in the right or left upper chest near the collarbone. The lead is then inserted into a vein located in the upper chest near the collarbone. The tip of the lead is placed on the inner wall of the heart with the visual guidance of ''x-rays''. If there is more than one lead, the process is repeated. The other end of the lead (or leads) is connected to the defibrillator unit, which is then inserted under the skin at the incision site. Because there are no nerve endings inside the blood vessels and the heart, the patient usually does not feel the placement of the lead(s).''Heavy sedation is used during the procedure when the defibrillator is tested for proper functioning. Testing an ICD involves inducing a rapid heart rhythm and allowing the defibrillator to detect the abnormal rhythm and then terminate it with a shock (just as the device would be expected to operate in a real-life tachycardia episode).' "
What happens after implantation of an implantable cardiac defibrillator?,"""While in the hospital, the patient's heart rhythms, pulse, and blood pressures are routinely monitored. The doctor may check or adjust the settings on the defibrillator (done from outside the body). The nurses also periodically examine the incision over the implantation site for bleeding, redness, or other signs of infection. It is normal to feel some ""'pain'' over the incision for 1-2 weeks. Medications are usually given to alleviate ''pain''.''Patients are typically discharged from the hospital the day after the procedure. Once home, the patient can usually return to most activities. Instructions are given to avoid raising the arm over the shoulder on the side of the ICD implantation for several weeks. This precaution is to avoid dislodging the leads before they become secure inside the veins and the heart. Patients are also asked to avoid contact sports, vigorous exercises, and heavy lifting for several weeks.''In a week, the ''sutures'"" over the incision are removed in the doctor's office. This is a good opportunity to discuss the following issues with the doctor:""'Call the doctor if there is bleeding from the incision site, increasing pain over the incision site, ''fever'', heat, swelling, or fluid draining from the incision site. Also call if the arm becomes swollen on the side of the implantation or if there is twitching of chest muscles, persistent ''hiccups'', ''dizziness'', ''fainting'', ''chest pain'', or ''shortness of breath''.' Level of physical activity; Return to work; Permission to drive automobiles; How frequently should the ICD and battery level be checked? What are the signs of device failure? When to replace the ICD (most ICD batteries last 3-7 years)? Precautions regarding interference with the device by outside power sources; and What to do when tachycardias occur."
What are the complications of implantable cardiac defibrillator implantation?,"'Common complications include pain, swelling, and minor bleeding at the implantation site. More serious complications are uncommon and typically occur less than 2% of the time. Serious complications include major bleeding requiring blood transfusions, introduction of air into the space between the lung and chest wall (''pneumothorax'') requiring tube drainage, perforation of the heart muscle by the leads, activation of an intractably fast heart rhythm, ''stroke'', heart attack, need for emergency heart surgery, and death. Although there are no official guidelines, ICDs should be implanted by or in conjunction with a cardiologist specially trained in clinical cardiac electrophysiology (electrical diseases of the heart).' "
What happens during a tachycardia episode after implantation of an Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator?,"'When the heart is beating normally, the ICD remains inactive. When tachycardia occurs, the patient typically experiences the symptoms of a fast heart rate. Since tachycardia can lower blood pressure and cause ''dizziness'' or fainting spells, the person should lie down or sit down until the symptoms pass. The ICD will either send a series of pacemaker-like weak electrical signals or one or more low energy shocks to convert the tachycardia to normal rhythm. The patient may not feel the pacemaker-like signals, while the low energy shocks may feel like thumps in the chest. Terminating a tachycardia with low energy shocks is called ''cardioversion''.''If ventricular fibrillation occurs, the patient may suddenly feel faint or lose consciousness due to lack of blood pressure and blood supply to the brain. The ICD, sensing the rapid and irregular rhythm, quickly sends a strong shock to terminate the rhythm. Terminating fibrillation with a strong electric shock is called ''defibrillation''. Successful defibrillation promptly restores consciousness. If unconsciousness lasts longer than 30 seconds, emergency 911 should be called.''The patient, or anyone available to assist, should also call emergency (911) if any of the following occur:' Symptoms of tachycardia persist after feeling the shock(s); Symptoms of tachycardia persist and the patient feels no shocks (possible ICD malfunction); or The patient feels a series of shocks in a row (possible ICD malfunction or recurrent attacks of tachycardias). Both conditions need prompt medical attention."
Living with an implantable cardiac defibrillator,"'After recovering fully from the ICD implantation, most patients can resume normal activities, including ''exercise'' and sex. The doctor should prescribe the type and intensity of the ''exercise''. The doctor also decides when the patient can return to work.'""Every patient is given an ICD identification card. The ID card contains information regarding the ICD and instructions in case of an emergency. The card should be carried in the patient's wallet at all times and shown to other doctors and dentists. Occasionally, it will need to be shown to security officers at the airport.""  "
What outside electrical sources are safe?,"'ICDs are well protected from most household electrical appliances in good condition such as radios, televisions, stereos, microwave ovens, electrical blankets, computers, vacuum cleaners, etc.' "
What outside electrical sources can interfere with the implantable cardiac defibrillator?,"'Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'' scan) is a diagnostic test for studying the brain, the joints, the spine, the ''liver'', and other organs. The strong magnetic field from the MRI scan can interfere with ICDs. Patients with ICDs should not undergo MRI scanning.''Digital cellular phones can interfere with ICDs. Therefore, the cellular phone should be held on the ear opposite from the side of the ICD. Do not carry the cellular phone in the pocket near the chest.''Theft detector gates in certain stores can generate signals that interfere with the ICD. While it is safe for patients with ICDs to quickly walk through these gates, they should not stand at or near the gates.''Similarly, the metal detector gates at airports can send strong signals that interfere with the ICDs. This problem can be avoided by presenting the ICD ID card to the security officers and ''walking'' around the gates. Hand held security wands (such as those used by airport security officers) have magnetic fields that can interfere with the device. Scanning by these wands should be avoided.''Heavy-duty electrical powered equipment, arc welders, a ''running'' car engine, and certain electrically powered surgical tools can also cause disturbances with the ICD. Patients should obtain permission from their doctors prior to driving a car or operating equipment which may fall into the above category.''Although a running car should not interfere with an ICD during driving, a patient should not lean over a running engine.

What does the future hold for ICDs?,"'Implantable defibrillator technology continues to improve. The size of ICDs has decreased dramatically which makes the ICD easier to implant, less visible, and more comfortable. Other advances include not only technology improvements, but clinical trials that may expand the indications and uses for this exciting lifesaving device.' "
What is iron and why do we need it?,"'Iron is a mineral needed by our bodies. Iron is a part of all cells and does many things in our bodies. For example, iron (as part of the protein ''hemoglobin'') carries oxygen from our ''lungs'' throughout our bodies. Having too little ''hemoglobin'' is called ''anemia''. Iron also helps our muscles store and use oxygen.'""Iron is a part of many enzymes and is used in many cell functions. Enzymes help our bodies digest foods and also help with many other important reactions that occur within our bodies. When our bodies don't have enough iron, many parts of our bodies are affected."" "
What is iron deficiency and why is it a concern?,"'Iron deficiency is a condition resulting from too little iron in the body. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and the leading cause of ''anemia'' in the United States.''The terms ''anemia'', iron deficiency, and ''iron deficiency anemia'' often are used interchangeably but equivalent. Iron deficiency ranges from depleted iron stores without functional or health impairment to iron deficiency with anemia, which affects the functioning of several organ systems.''Iron deficiency is a concern because:' Iron deficiency can delay normal infant motor function (normal activity and movement) or mental function (normal thinking and processing skills). Iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy can increase risk for small or early (preterm) babies.  Small or early babies are more likely to have health problems or die in the first year of life than infants who are born full term and are not small. Iron deficiency can cause fatigue that impairs the ability to do physical work in adults. Iron deficiency may also affect memory or other mental function in teens."
Signs and Symptoms of Iron Deficiency,"'Too little iron can impair body functions, but most physical signs and symptoms do not show up unless iron deficiency anemia occurs. Someone with early stages of iron deficiency may have no signs or symptoms. This is why it is important to screen for too little iron among high risk groups.''Signs of iron deficiency anemia include'':'   Feeling tired and weak Decreased work and school performance Slow cognitive and social development during childhood Difficulty maintaining body temperature Decreased immune function, which increases susceptibility to infection Glossitis (an inflamed tongue)"
What causes iron deficiency?,"'Iron deficiency has many causes. (See table below for a summary). These causes fall into two main categories:''Many common conditions can cause people to need additional iron:''The amount of iron absorbed from the ''diet'' depends on many factors:' Increased iron needs Because of their rapid growth, infants and toddlers need more iron than older children. Sometimes it can be hard for them to get enough iron from their normal diet. Women who are pregnant have higher iron needs. To get enough, most women must take an iron supplement as recommended by their healthcare provider. When people lose blood, they also lose iron. They need extra iron to replace what they have lost. Increased blood loss can occur with heavy menstrual periods, frequent blood donation, as well as with some stomach and intestinal conditions (food sensitivity, hookworms.) Decreased iron intake or absorption (not enough iron taken into the body) Iron from meat, poultry, and fish (i.e., heme iron) is absorbed two to three times more efficiently than iron from plants (i.e., non-heme iron). The amount of iron absorbed from plant foods (non-heme iron) depends on the other types of foods eaten at the same meal. Foods containing heme iron (meat, poultry, and fish) enhance iron absorption from foods that contain non-heme iron (e.g., fortified cereals, some beans, and spinach). Foods containing vitamin C (see Dietary Sources of vitamin C) also enhance non-heme iron absorption when eaten at the same meal. Substances (such as polyphenols, phytates, or calcium) that are part of some foods or drinks such as tea, coffee, whole grains, legumes and milk or dairy products can decrease the amount of non-heme iron absorbed at a meal. Calcium can also decrease the amount heme-iron absorbed at a meal. However, for healthy individuals who consume a varied diet that conforms to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the amount of iron inhibition from these substances is usually not of concern.  Vegetarian diets are low in heme iron, but careful meal planning can help increase the amount of iron absorbed. Some other factors (such as taking antacids beyond the recommended dose or medicine used to treat peptic ulcer disease and acid reflux) can reduce the amount of acid in the stomach and the iron absorbed and cause iron deficiency. Rapid growth Pregnancy Blood loss
Heavy menstrual periods
Frequent blood donation
Some stomach and intestinal conditions (food sensitivity, hookworms)

 Heavy menstrual periods Frequent blood donation Some stomach and intestinal conditions (food sensitivity, hookworms) Lack of heme iron sources in the diet (e.g., vegetarian diets) Low absorption

 Taking antacids beyond the recommended dose or medicine used to treat peptic ulcer disease and acid reflux can reduce the amount of iron absorbed in the stomach."
Who is most at risk for iron deficiency?," Young children and pregnant women are at higher risk of iron deficiency because of rapid growth and higher iron needs.  Adolescent girls and women of childbearing age are at risk due to menstruation. Among children, iron deficiency is seen most often between six months and three years of age due to rapid growth and inadequate intake of dietary iron. Infants and children at highest risk are the following groups:
Babies who were born early or small.
Babies given cow's milk before age 12 months.
Breastfed babies who after age 6 months are not being given plain, iron-fortified cereals or another good source of iron from other foods.
Formula-fed babies who do not get iron-fortified formulas.
Children aged 1–5 years who get more than 24 ounces of cow, goat, or soymilk per day. Excess milk intake can decrease your child's desire for food items with greater iron content, such as meat or iron fortified cereal.
Children who have special health needs, for example, children with chronic infections or restricted diets.

How is iron deficiency detected?,"'Your doctor or healthcare provider will do blood tests to screen for iron deficiency. No single test is used to diagnose iron deficiency. The most common tests for screening are''These tests show how much iron is in your body. Hemoglobin and ''hematocrit'"" levels usually aren't decreased until the later stages of iron deficiency, i.e., anemia.""'Sometimes other blood tests are used to confirm that anemia is due to iron deficiency. These might include'    Hemoglobin test (a test that measures hemoglobin which is a protein in the blood that carries oxygen)  Hematocrit test (the percentage of red blood cells in your blood by volume)  Complete blood count (to look at the number and volume of the red blood cells) Serum ferritin (a measure of a stored form of iron) Serum iron (a measure of the iron in your blood) Transferrin saturation (a measure of the transported form of iron) Transferrin receptor (a measure of increased red blood cell production)"
How is iron deficiency treated?,"""Again, it is important to be diagnosed by your healthcare provider because iron deficiency can have causes that aren't related to your diet. Your healthcare provider's recommendations will be specific to your needs.""   If you are found to have an iron deficiency, it is important to see your healthcare provider for treatment. Your treatment will depend on factors such as your age, health, and cause of iron deficiency. If your doctor or health care provider thinks that you have iron deficiency she or he may prescribe iron supplements for you to take and then ask that you return after a period to have your hemoglobin or hematocrit tested. If your healthcare provider determines that the iron deficiency is due to a diet low in iron, you might be told to eat more iron-rich foods. Your health care provider may also prescribe an iron supplement for you."
What can I do to prevent iron deficiency?,"'In general, you can eat a healthful diet that includes good sources of iron. A healthful diet includes''In addition to a healthful diet that includes good sources of iron, you can also eat foods that help your body absorb iron better. For example, you can eat a fruit or vegetable that is a good source of vitamin C (see table on Dietary Sources of vitamin C) with a food or meal that contains non-heme iron (see table below for Dietary Sources of Iron). Vitamin C helps your body absorb the non-heme iron foods you eat, especially when the food containing non-heme iron and the vitamin-C rich food are eaten at the same meal.''The following recommendations are for specific groups who are at greater risk for iron deficiency.''It is recommended that pregnant women:' fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat free or nonfat milk and milk products, lean meats, fish, dry beans, eggs, nuts, and is low in saturated fat, trans fats, cholesterol, salt, and added sugars. If possible, breastfeed your baby for at least 12 months and starting at 4 to 6 months of age, give your baby plain, iron-fortified infant cereal and/or pureed meat. Just two or more servings a day can meet a baby's iron needs at this age. Meats should be home prepared or commercially prepared plain pureed (chopped until smooth in a blender) meats. When your baby is about 6 months of age, include a feeding per day of foods rich in vitamin C with foods that are rich in non-heme iron to improve iron absorption. If you can't breastfeed, use iron-fortified formula. Don't give low-iron milks (e.g. cow's milk, goat's milk, and soy milk) until your baby is at least 12 months old. If your baby was born early or small, talk to your doctor about giving iron drops to your baby. If your baby can't get two or more servings per day of iron rich foods (such as iron-fortified cereal or pureed meats), talk to your doctor about giving iron drops to your baby. After your child is one year old, give no more than three 8 ounce servings of whole cow, goat, or soy milk per day. After your child is 2 years old, low fat or nonfat milks should be used in place of whole milks. Vitamin D-fortified milk is a good source of calcium and vitamin D, but not iron. Give your child a diet with iron-rich foods such as iron-fortified breads and iron-fortified cereals and lean meats.

What is primary immunodeficiency disease?,"'Primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) is a condition in which the immune system is weaker than normal. The term ""primary"" implies that there is an independent problem of the immune system rather than a weakening of the immune system due to another condition like ''HIV/AIDS'' (a secondary immune deficiency). ''Primary immunodeficiency disease is most often identified in infants and children, but it is possible that the condition is identified in adulthood. Primary immunodeficiency disease represents a diverse group of hundreds of diseases that can weaken the immune system. ''Most often, primary immunodeficiency disease results in increased susceptibility to both acute and chronic (long-term) infections.'  "
What are the types and examples of primary immunodeficiency diseases?,"'Primary immunodeficiency disease is a group of multiple different diseases. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes over 250 diseases that lead to primary immunodeficiency. The conditions that are immune deficient can include problems with antibody formation, problems with cell-mediated immune response, or innate immune system disorders.''The types of primary immunodeficiency disease are far too numerous to list here. Examples of some of the more commonly known primary immunodeficiency diseases include:'  Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome Severe combined immunodeficiency 
disease (SCID) DiGeorge syndrome 
Ataxia-telangectasia Chronic granulomatous disease Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of 
infancy Agammaglobulinemia Complement deficiencies Selective IgA deficiency"
"What causes primary immunodeficiency disease and who gets primary 
immunodeficiency disease?","'Most primary immunodeficiency diseases are inherited, meaning that there is a gene defect present at birth that leads to the condition. As such, the condition usually is seen in infants or children. Sometimes, however, the condition may not become apparent until late childhood or even adulthood.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of primary immunodeficiency disease?,"'Many of the specific forms of primary immunodeficiency disease will have symptoms and signs specific to that condition, but in general, PIDDs are characterized by ''frequent infections''. In particular, symptoms and signs suggestive of primary immunodeficiency disease can include:'  Frequent or hard-to-treat infections 
Recurrent pneumonia, sinus infections, 
or ear infections Weight loss or delayed growth Enlarged lymph nodes Enlarged spleen Recurrent deep abscesses in internal 
organs Recurrent skin abscesses Digestive problems, including nausea, 
diarrhea, or abdominal cramping Abnormal blood counts"
Is primary immunodeficiency disease inherited?,"'Most cases of PIDD are genetic, inherited diseases.' "
"Which types of doctors treat primary immunodeficiency 
disease?","'Immunologists are scientists or doctors who specialize in diseases of the immune system. Immunologist physicians may manage the treatment of patients with primary immunodeficiency disease. Infectious disease specialists are also frequently involved in the care of these patients. Depending on the exact cause of primary immunodeficiency disease, other specialists may be consulted, including neurologists, hematologists, rheumatologists, internal medicine specialists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, and others. ' "
How is primary immunodeficiency disease diagnosed?,"'Any patient suspected of having a primary immunodeficiency disease will undergo a thorough medical examination. Blood tests are typically done to make the diagnosis. Blood tests are done to check for immune cell counts as well as levels of antibodies and other substances necessary for a functioning immune system. DNA testing may be done to identify a specific genetic defect.''In families with a known history of primary immunodeficiency disease, ''prenatal testing'' may be done to detect genetic problems in the developing fetus.' "
What is the treatment for primary immunodeficiency disease?,"'To treat recurrent infections ''antibiotics, antiviral medications, and antifungal drugs may be used. These medications may be stronger than those used to treat infections in people with a normally functioning immune system and may need to be administered intravenously (IV). Sometimes, long-term antibiotics are given to prevent the development of infections. ''To boost the immune system:'' The treatment for primary immunodeficiency disease depends upon the specific defect that is causing the immune system to malfunction. Examples of immune system treatments include:''Stem cell transplantation '""can be used to replace the defective immune system in patients with severe or life-threatening types of primary immunodeficiency disease. This requires a stem cell donor that is a biologic match to the patient. Typically, the patient's immune system is destroyed via ""'chemotherapy'' and/or ''radiation therapy'', and the normal ''stem cells'' are transferred to the patient. Stem cell transplantation has a number of risks and is not always successful, but it can offer some patients with primary immunodeficiency disease a permanent cure.'  Intravenous or subcutaneous 
immunoglobulins to provide antibodies to fight infection Growth factor therapy if immune

What support groups are available for primary immunodeficiency disease?,"'The Immune Deficiency Foundation'' offers a number of support and educational resources, including ''peer support programs''. Your treatment center or care team may also have information about specific support programs in your area.' "
What is the design of the spine?,"'The vertebrae are the bony building blocks of the spine. Between each of the largest part of the vertebrae are the discs. Ligaments are situated around the spine and discs. The spine has seven vertebrae in the neck (cervical vertebrae of the cervical spine), 12 vertebrae in the mid-back (thoracic vertebrae of the thoracic spine), and five vertebrae in the low back (''lumbar vertebrae'' of the lumbar spine). In addition, in the mid-buttock beneath the fifth lumbar vertebra are five sacral vertebrae -- usually fused as the ''sacrum'' bone followed by the tailbone (''coccyx'').' "
What is the purpose of the spine and its discs?,"'The bony spine is designed so that vertebrae ""stacked"" together can provide a movable support structure. The spine also protects the spinal cord (nervous tissue that extends down the spinal column from the brain) from injury. Each vertebra has a ''bony arch behind the spinal cord that shields the cord\'s nerve tissue. The vertebrae also have a strong bony ""body"" in front of the spinal cord to provide a platform suitable for weight-bearing.''The spinal discs are pads that serve as cushions between each vertebral body that serve to minimize the impact of movement on the spinal column. Because the discs are situated between vertebrae, they are sometimes referred to as intervertebral discs. Each disc is designed like a jelly donut with a central softer component (nucleus pulposus) surrounded by a firmer ring of tissue (annulus fibrosus). With injury or degeneration, this softer component can sometimes rupture (herniate) through the surrounding outer ring (annulus fibrosus) and irritate adjacent nervous tissue. Ligaments are strong fibrous soft tissues that firmly attach bones to bones. Ligaments attach each of the vertebrae and surround each of the discs. When ligaments are injured as the disc degenerates, localized ''pain'' in the area affected can result.' "
What is degenerative disc disease? What causes degenerative disc disease?,"'As we age, the water and protein content of the cartilage of the body changes. This change results in weaker, more fragile, and thin cartilage. Because both the discs and the joints that stack the vertebrae (facet joints) are partly composed of cartilage, these areas are subject to wear and tear over time (degenerative changes). The gradual deterioration of the disc between the vertebrae is referred to as degenerative disc disease, sometimes abbreviated DDD. Wear of the facet cartilage and the bony changes of the adjacent joint is referred to as degenerative facet joint disease or ''osteoarthritis'' of the spine. ''Trauma'' injury to the spine can also lead to degenerative disc disease.''Degeneration of the disc space and its contents is medically referred to as spondylosis. Spondylosis can be noted on X-ray tests or ''MRI'' scanning of the spine as a narrowing of the normal ""disc space"" between the adjacent vertebrae.' "
What are degenerative disc disease symptoms?,"'Degeneration of the disc tissue makes the disc more susceptible to herniation. Degenerative spondylosis is another name for degeneration of disc tissue. Degeneration of the disc can cause local pain in the affected area. Any level of the spine can be affected by disc degeneration. When disc degeneration affects the spine of the neck, it is referred to as cervical disc disease. When the mid-back is affected, the condition is referred to as thoracic disc disease. Disc degeneration that affects the lumbar spine can cause ''low back pain'' (referred to as ''lumbago'') or irritation of a ''spinal nerve'' to cause pain radiating down the leg (''sciatica''). ''Lumbago'' causes pain localized to the low back and is common in older people. ''Degenerative arthritis'' (osteoarthritis) of the facet joints that can be detected with plain X-ray testing is also a cause of localized ''lumbar pain''. The pain from degenerative disc or joint disease of the spine is usually treated conservatively with intermittent heat, rest, rehabilitative exercises, and medications to relieve pain, ''muscle spasm'', and inflammation.'  "
What are the symptoms of radiculopathy and sciatica?,"'Radiculopathy'' refers to nerve irritation caused by damage to the disc between the vertebrae. This occurs because of degeneration (""wear and tear"") of the outer ring of the disc or because of traumatic injury, or both. ''Weakness'' of the outer ring leads to disc bulging and ''disc herniation''. As a result, the central softer portion of the disc can rupture through the outer ring of the disc and abut the spinal cord or its nerves as they exit the bony spinal column.''It is important to note that many people have degenerative spines without having any symptoms. When nerves are irritated in the neck from degenerative disc disease, the condition is referred to as cervical radiculopathy. This can lead to painful burning or tingling sensations in the arms. When nerves are irritated in the low back from degenerative disc disease, the condition is called ''lumbar radiculopathy'', and it often causes the commonly recognized ""sciatica"" pain that shoots down a lower extremity. This condition can be preceded by a localized low-back aching. Sciatica pain can follow a ""popping"" sensation at onset and be accompanied by numbness and tingling. The pain commonly increases with movements at the waist and can increase with ''coughing'' or ''sneezing''. In more severe instances, lumbar radiculopathy can be accompanied by ''incontinence'' of the bladder and/or bowels.' "
"How do health care professionals diagnose degenerative disc disease, radiculopathy, and sciatica?","'Degenerative disc disease, radiculopathy, and sciatica are suspected when the symptoms described above are noted. The doctor can sometimes detect signs of irritated nerves during the examination. For example, increased radiating pain when the lower extremity is lifted supports the diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy. Nerve testing (''EMG''/''electromyogram'' and NCV/nerve conduction velocity) of the lower extremities can be used to detect the nerve irritation. Health care professionals can visualize degenerative spondylosis using plain film X-ray imaging of the spine, CAT, or MRI scanning. The actual disc herniation can be detected with radiology testing, such as CAT or MRI scanning.' "
"What is the treatment for degenerative disc disease, radiculopathy, and sciatica?","'The treatment of degenerative disc disease, radiculopathy, and sciatica ranges from nonsurgical (medical) management to surgery. Medical management of radiculopathy includes patient education of the condition, medications to relieve pain (''NSAIDs'', analgesics) and muscles spasm (muscle relaxants), ''cortisone injection'' around the spinal cord (epidural injection), physical therapy (heat, exercises, ''massage'', ''ultrasound'', electrical stimulation), chiropractic manipulation and rest (not strict bed rest, but avoiding reinjury). With unrelenting pain, severe impairment of function, or incontinence (which can indicate spinal cord irritation), surgery may be necessary. The operation performed depends on the overall status of the spine and the age and health of the patient. Procedures include removal of the ''herniated disc'' with laminotomy (producing a small hole in the bone of the spine surrounding the spinal cord), laminectomy (removal of the bony wall adjacent to the nerve tissues), by needle technique through the skin (percutaneous discectomy), disc-dissolving procedures (chemonucleolysis), and others.'  "
What is bony encroachment and spinal stenosis?,"'Any condition that results in movement or growth of the bony vertebrae of the spine can limit the space (encroachment) for the adjacent spinal cord and nerves. Causes of bony encroachment of the spinal nerves include foramen narrowing (narrowing of the portal through which the spinal nerve passes from the spinal column, out of the spinal canal to the body), ''spondylolisthesis'' (slipping of one vertebra relative to another), and spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal causing by compression of the nerve roots or spinal cord by bony spurs or other soft tissues in the spinal canal). For example, lumbar ''spinal nerve compression'' in these conditions can lead to sciatica pain that radiates down the lower extremities.'""Spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) can occur at any level of the spine, but it's most common in the lumbar spine of the low back. Symptoms depend on the level affected. For example, ""'lumbar spinal stenosis'' can cause lower-extremity pains that worsen with ''walking'' and are relieved by resting (mimicking poor circulation of the lower extremities).''Treatment of these conditions varies (depending on the severity and condition of the patient) from rest to epidural cortisone injection and surgical decompression by removing the bone that is compressing the nervous tissue.' "
"What is the outlook (prognosis) of degenerative disc disease, radiculopathy, and sciatica?","'The outlook of degenerative disc disease, radiculopathy, and sciatica depends on the severity of the condition, its precise cause, and the interventions used to treat the patient. When patients respond to conservative treatments, the result can be complete healing. Surgical repairs can require postoperative rehabilitation, including physical therapy.' "
"Is it possible to prevent degenerative disc disease, radiculopathy, and sciatica?","'Avoiding injury can prevent degenerative spondylosis and resulting nerve irritation. When the disease already exists, aggravation of existing symptoms can be avoided by limiting stressing or overusing the involved spine.' "
What is dehydration?,"""Water is a critical element of the body, and keeping the body adequately hydrated is a must to allow the body to function. Up to 60% of the body's weight is made up of water. Most of the water is found within the cells of the body (intracellular space). The rest is found in the extracellular space, which consists of the blood vessels (intravascular space) and the spaces between cells (interstitial space).""'Dehydration occurs when the amount of water leaving the body is greater than the amount being taken in. The body is very dynamic and always changing. This is especially true with water in the body. We lose water routinely when we:''In a normal day, a person has to drink a significant amount of water to replace this routine loss.'""The formula for daily fluid requirements depends upon an individual's weight. Normally, fluid and weight are calculated using the metric system; however, below is the approximation in imperial (American) units.""'If you would like to calculate your body weight and daily fluid requirements using the metric system, please use this formula.''This is the basic body requirement. More fluid would be needed to replace excess ''sweating'' from ''exercise'' or ''fever'', fluid loss from ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea'' or increased urine production.' breathe and humidified air leaves the body (this can be seen on a cold day when you can see your breath in the air, which is just water that has been exhaled); sweat to cool the body; and eliminate waste by urinating or having a bowel movement. For the first 10kg (kilogram) of body weight the daily fluid intake required is 100cc (or mL) per kg. For the next 10kg of body weight, the fluid required is an additional 50 cc/kg. For every additional kg of body weight, an additional 10cc/kg is required."
What causes dehydration?,"'Dehydration occurs because there is too much water lost, not enough water taken in, or most commonly, a combination of the two.'   Diarrhea: Diarrhea is the most common reason for a person to lose excess amounts of water. A significant amount of water can be lost with each bowel movement. Worldwide, more than four million children die each year because of dehydration from diarrhea. Vomiting: Vomiting can also be a cause of fluid loss. Not only can an individual lose fluid in the vomitus, but it may be difficult to replace water by drinking because of that same nausea and vomiting. Sweat: The body can lose significant amounts of water in the form of sweat when it tries to cool itself. Whether the body temperature is increased because of working or exercising in a hot environment or because a fever is present due to an infection; the body uses water in the form of sweat to cool itself. Depending upon weather conditions, a brisk walk may generate up to 16 ounces of sweat (a pound of water) an hour to allow body cooling, and that water needs to be replaced by the thirst mechanism signaling the person to drink fluids. Diabetes: In people with diabetes, elevated blood sugar levels cause sugar to spill into the urine and water then follows, which may cause significant dehydration. For this reason, frequent urination and excessive thirst are among the early symptoms of diabetes. Burns: The skin acts as a protective barrier for the body and is also responsible for regulating fluid loss. Burn victims become dehydrated because the damaged skin cannot prevent fluid from seeping out of the body. Other inflammatory diseases of the skin such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, also may be associated with significant fluid loss. Inability to drink fluids: The inability to drink adequately is the other potential cause of dehydration, whether it is the lack of availability of water, intense nausea with or without vomiting, or the lack of strength to drink. This coupled with routine or extraordinary water losses can compound the degree of dehydration."
Dehydration picture,"'The body is able to monitor the amount of fluid it needs to function. The thirst mechanism signals the body to drink water when the body is dry. Moreover, hormones like anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) work with the kidney to limit the amount of water lost in the urine when the body needs to conserve water (diuretic = increased excretion of water).' "
What are the signs and symptoms of dehydration?,"""The body's initial responses to dehydration are thirst to increase water intake, and decreased urine output to try to conserve water loss. The urine will become concentrated and more yellow in color.""'As the level of water loss increases, more symptoms can become apparent. The following are further signs and ''symptoms of dehydration''.''The body tries to maintain cardiac output (the amount of blood that is pumped by the heart to the body); and if the amount of fluid in the intravascular space is decreased, the body compensates for this decrease by increasing the heart rate and making blood vessels constrict to try to maintain ''blood pressure'' and blood flow to the vital organs of the body. The body shunts blood flow away from the skin to internal organs, for example, the brain, heart, ''lungs'', kidneys, and ''intestines''; causing the skin to feel cool and clammy. This coping mechanism begins to fail as the level of dehydration increases.''With severe dehydration, ''confusion'' and weakness will occur as the brain and other body organs receive less blood flow. Finally, ''coma'', organ failure, and death eventually will occur if the dehydration remains untreated.'   Dry mouth Eyes stop making tears Sweating may stop Muscle cramps Nausea and vomiting Heart palpitations Lightheadedness (especially when standing) Weakness Decreased urine output"
What about dehydration in children?,"'Millions of children die worldwide each year because of dehydration, often because of diarrhea. The temperature regulation and sweat mechanism of infants are not well developed, and this increases their risk of ''heat-related illness''.''It is important to remember that infants and children are dependent upon others to provide them with water and ''nutrition''. Infants cannot tell their parents or care providers when they are thirsty. Enough fluid needs to be provided so that the dehydration can be prevented. This is especially true if increased water loss occurs because of fever, vomiting or diarrhea.''In children, symptoms of dehydration increase as the level of dehydration increases.''Infants and children respond well to fluid replacement, and often oral rehydration therapy (ORT) can treat dehydration. Small, frequent sips of fluid replacement solutions such as ''Pedialyte'' or Gatorade may be enough to prevent the need for intravenous fluids. In ORT, replacement begins with 5cc or one teaspoon of fluid every 5-10 minutes. If this is tolerated without vomiting, the amount of fluid is doubled, again providing small amounts every few minutes. However, if the child is too ill to drink or cannot tolerate even small sips of fluid, medical care should be accessed immediately.''Intravenous fluids can rehydrate the infant or child while the underlying illness is evaluated and treated. Occasionally, there is difficulty in placing an intravenous line and an intraosseous (inside the bone) needle can be placed, usually in the tibia (shin bone) that allows fluid resuscitation.''In children who are markedly dehydrated, blood tests may be used to monitor ''electrolytes'', kidney function, and acid-base balance in the body.''It is important to find the reason for the illness because dehydration is the result of a disease process, not the cause of it.' "
How do doctors diagnose dehydration?,"""Dehydration is often a clinical diagnosis. Aside from diagnosing the reason for dehydration, the health care professional's examination of the patient will assess the level of dehydration. Initial evaluations may include:""'The purpose of blood tests is to assess potential ''electrolyte'"" abnormalities (including sodium, potassium, chloride, and carbon dioxide levels) associated with the dehydration. Other tests may or may not be ordered depending upon the underlying cause of dehydration, the severity of illness, and the health care professional's assessment of their needs and available resources.""'Other blood tests may be helpful in determining the level of dehydration. ''Hemoglobin'' and red blood cell counts may be elevated because the blood is more concentrated with water loss from the intravascular space.''Kidney function tests including BUN and ''creatinine'' may be elevated, and this is one way of measuring the severity of dehydration.''Urinalysis'' may be ordered to determine urine concentration; the more concentrated the urine, the more dehydrated the patient.' Mental status tests to evaluate whether the patient is awake, alert, and oriented. Infants and children may appear listless and have whiny cries and decreased muscle tone. Vital signs may include postural readings (blood pressure and pulse rate are taken lying down and standing). With dehydration, the pulse rate may increase and the blood pressure may drop because the blood is depleted of fluid. People taking beta blocker medications for high blood pressure, heart disease, or other indications, occasionally lose the ability to increase their heart rate as a compensation mechanism since these medications block the adrenaline receptors in the body. Temperature may be measured to assess fever. While it is common to measure temperature in the ear (tympanic) or by mouth (orally), a rectal thermometer may be used to assess core body temperature if the patient appears warm, but no fever is noted tympanically or orally. Skin may be checked to see if sweat is present and to assess the degree of elasticity (turgor). As dehydration progresses, the skin loses its water content and becomes less elastic. The amount of sweat is often felt in the armpit or groin, two areas that tend to have moisture normally. The mouth can become dry and the health care professional may look at or feel the tongue to see how wet it is. Infants may have additional evaluations performed, including checking for a soft spot on the skull (sunken fontanelle), and assessing the suck mechanism, loss of sweat in the armpits and groin, and muscle tone. All are signs of potential significant dehydration. Pediatric patients are often weighed during routine child visits, thus a body weight measurement may be helpful in assessing how much water has been lost with the acute illness. This is very rough estimate because all scales are not the same, and for infants and children, it is important to know what clothing they were wearing when the original weight was taken."
What is the treatment for dehydration?,"'As is often the case in medicine, ''prevention'' is the important first step in the treatment of dehydration. (Please see the home treatment and prevention sections.)''Fluid replacement is the treatment for dehydration. This may be attempted by replacing fluid by mouth, but if this fails, intravenous fluid (IV) may be required. Should oral rehydration be attempted, frequent small amounts of clear fluids should be used.''Clear fluids include most things you can see through.'""Decisions about the use of intravenous fluids depend upon the health care professional's assessment of the extent of dehydration, the ability for the patient to drink fluids by mouth, and the ability for the patient to recover from the underlying cause.""'The success of the rehydration therapy can be monitored by urine output. When the body is dry, the kidneys try to hold on to as much fluid as possible, urine output is decreased, and the urine itself is concentrated. As treatment occurs and if it is successful, the kidneys sense the increased amount of fluid within the intravascular space and urine output increases.''Medications may be used to treat underlying illnesses and to control fever, vomiting, or diarrhea.'   Water (please note that water alone is not necessarily safe to use in infants and can lead to significant electrolyte problems. For this reason, Pedialyte or other balanced electrolyte solutions should be used. Clear broths Popsicles Jell-O Other replacement fluids that may contain electrolytes (Pedialyte, Gatorade, Powerade, etc.)"
Can I treat dehydration at home?,"'Dehydration occurs over time. If it can be recognized in its earliest stages, and if its cause can be addressed, home treatment may be beneficial and adequate.''Steps a person can take at home to prevent severe dehydration include:''If the person becomes confused or lethargic; if there is persistent, uncontrolled fever, vomiting, or diarrhea; or if there are any other specific concerns, then medical care should be accessed.''Emergency medical system (EMS) or 911 should be activated for any individual with ''altered mental status'' - confusion, lethargy, or ''coma''.'   Individuals with vomiting and diarrhea can try to alter their diet and use medications to control symptoms to minimize water loss. Clear fluids are recommended as the diet of choice for the first 24 hours, with gradual progression to a regular diet as tolerated. Loperamide (Imodium) may be considered to control diarrhea. If the affected individual has a fever, or if there is blood in the diarrhea, medical advice should be obtained before administering medications to control diarrhea. Acetaminophen (Tylenol and others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others) may be used to control fever. Ibuprofen may irritate the stomach and cause nausea and vomiting, so it should be used with caution in patients who already have these symptoms. Fluid replacements may be attempted by small, frequent amounts of clear fluids (see clear fluids information in previous section). The amount of fluid required to maintain hydration depends upon the individual's weight. The average adult needs between 2 and 3 liters of fluid per day."
What are the complications of dehydration?,"'Complications of dehydration may occur because of the consequences of dehydration, and/or because of the underlying disease or situation that causes the fluid loss.''Kidney failure'' is a common occurrence and often is reversible, if it is due to dehydration and is treated early. As dehydration progresses, the volume of fluid in the body decreases, and blood pressure may fall. This can decrease blood flow to vital organs including the kidneys, and like any organ with a decreased blood flow; it has the potential to fail to do its job.''Decreased blood supply to the brain may cause confusion and even coma.'""When the fluid loss overwhelms the body's ability to compensate, blood flow and oxygen delivery to the body's vital organs become inadequate and cell and organ function can begin to fail. If enough organs begin to malfunction, the body itself may fail and death can occur.""""In heat-related illness, the body's attempt to cool itself by sweating may cause dehydration to the point that muscles may go into spasm (""'heat cramps''). It is often the muscles that are being stressed that will spasm (for example, in people who work outside in a hot environment, arm and leg muscles may spasm from lifting and moving heavy objects or equipment; in athletes, leg muscles may cramp from ''running''). As fluid loss increases, the symptoms of ''heat exhaustion'"" can occur and include weakness, lightheadedness, nausea, and vomiting. If the symptoms are recognized and the patient isn't moved from the heat and rehydrated, the situation may progress to ""'heat stroke''. The patient will stop sweating, have a change in mental status that includes confusion and coma, and the body temperature may spike to 106 F (41 C) or higher. Heat ''stroke'' is a true medical emergency and 911 or the emergency response system should be activated immediately in this situation.''In dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities may occur since important chemicals (like sodium, potassium, and chloride) are lost from the body through sweat. For example, patients with profuse diarrhea or vomiting may lose significant amounts of potassium, causing muscle weakness and heart rhythm disturbances. The health care professional may decide to monitor electrolyte levels by checking blood tests. Examples of symptoms caused by abnormal electrolyte levels include muscle weakness due to ''low potassium'', heart rhythm disturbances due to either low or ''high potassium'', and ''seizures'' due to low (''hyponatremia'') or high sodium (hypernatremia). In many patients with dehydration, the kidneys are able to compensate and regulate electrolyte levels.''It is important to remember that dehydration does not occur quickly, and sometimes it may take hours to slowly correct the fluid deficit and allow the electrolytes to redistribute themselves appropriately in the different spaces in the body. If rehydration is done too slowly, the patient may remain hypotensive and in ''shock'' for too long. If done too quickly, water and electrolyte concentrations within organ cells can be negatively affected, causing cells to swell and eventually become damaged.' "
Is it possible to prevent dehydration?,"   Environment: Dehydration due to the weather is a preventable condition. If possible, activities should not be scheduled in the heat of the day. If they are, adequate fluids should be available, and cooler, shaded areas should be used if possible. People should be monitored to make certain they are safe. Those working in hot environments need to take care to drink plenty of fluids and be self-aware of their condition. In heat waves, it is important to routinely check on neighbors, especially the elderly or those that do not have air conditioning. People exercising and working in a hot environment need to drink adequate amounts of water. People can become dehydrated while playing in the ocean, lakes, or pools if the water and environmental temperatures are warm enough. Age: The young and elderly are most at risk because of poor temperature regulation systems. During heat waves, attempts should be made to check on the elderly in their homes. During the Chicago heat wave of 1995, more than 600 people died in their homes from heat exposure. Heat related conditions: Know the signs and symptoms of heat cramps, heat rash, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Preventing dehydration is one step to avoid these conditions."
What is dehydration?,"'Dehydration'' occurs when the body fluid loss exceeds the intake. If the lost fluid is not replaced, it will eventually lead to a decrease in fluid levels in the body, affecting normal body functions. The most prominent effect of ''dehydration'' is ''low blood pressure'', which triggers the ''stress'' response in the body.''Dehydration can occur in anyone, including animals. It can be dangerous in ''babies'', young children, and older adults.' "
What causes dehydration?,"'Dehydration may be caused due to the following:''Risk factors of dehydration include:' Decreased fluid intake: Not consuming enough fluids due to sickness, a busy schedule, or lack of access to water while exercising, traveling, or hiking, etc. Excessive sweating: Excessive sweating due to vigorous exercise or hot and humid climates can cause increased fluid loss if not replaced appropriately. Increased urination: Increased urination may occur because of medical conditions like uncontrolled diabetes or certain medications, such as diuretics and some blood pressure medications. Diarrhea and/or vomiting: Severe, acute diarrhea or vomiting can cause loss of water and electrolytes in a short amount of time. The fluid loss increases if vomiting and diarrhea are both present. Fever: The higher the fever, the more dehydrated one becomes. Infants and children: Infants and children are especially vulnerable to dehydration and experience severe diarrhea and vomiting. Due to their smaller body size, they tend to lose a higher proportion of fluids compared to the volume of their body. Babies and children are also unable to complain of thirst, causing dehydration. Elderly: With increasing age, the body's fluid reserve and the body’s ability to conserve water decreases. Chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, and certain medications can further lead to dehydration. Weather: Hot and humid weather causes excessive sweating and increases the risk of dehydration and heatstroke. Chronic illnesses: Chronic medical conditions like diabetes or kidney disease can increase urination and increase the risk of dehydration. Acute medical conditions like sore throat or tonsillitis increase the risk of dehydration due to the patient’s inability to drink fluids due to pain."
What are the signs and symptoms of dehydration?,"'Thirst may always be a reliable indicator of dehydration. Many may not feel thirsty until dehydration occurs; hence, it is recommended to increase fluid intake when there is a risk of dehydration to prevent dehydration. The signs and ''symptoms of dehydration'' include:''Signs and symptoms in infant and children are''Signs and symptoms in adults are' Dry mouth and tongue No tears when crying Decreased urination Sunken eyes, cheeks Excessive crying Irritability When the skin is pinched, it retracts back slowly. Extreme thirst Dryness of the mouth and tongue Dry eyes Decreased urination Deep yellow colored urine Fatigue Lethargy Irritability When the skin is pinched, it retracts back slowly."
How can dehydration be prevented?,"'The best way to prevent dehydration is to drink plenty of fluids and eat foods that are high in water content, such as fruits and vegetables. It is recommended to drink six to eight glasses per day.''Fluid intake may need to be increased in the following conditions to prevent dehydration:''Medical attention is required to prevent dehydration and associated complications in the following conditions:' Vomiting and/or diarrhea Strenuous exercise Hot and humid or cold weather Chronic illness Diarrhea and/or vomiting for more than 24 hours High-grade fever Change in mood (irritability) or disorientation, lethargy, or loss of consciousness Unable to drink fluids or hold down fluids due to vomiting Bloodstained or black colored stools Unable to pass urine in the last 24 hours"
What is gastroparesis?,"'Gastroparesis means ''weakness'' of the muscles of the stomach. Gastroparesis results in poor grinding of food in the stomach into small particles and slow emptying of food from the stomach into the small intestine.'""The stomach is a hollow organ composed primarily of muscle. Solid food that has been swallowed is stored in the stomach while it is ground into tiny pieces by the constant churning generated by rhythmic contractions of the stomach's muscles. Smaller particles are digested better in the small intestine than larger particles, and only food that has been ground into small particles is emptied from the stomach then digested. Liquid food does not require grinding.""'The ground solid and liquid food is emptied from the stomach into the small intestine slowly in a metered fashion. The metering process allows the emptied food to mixed well with the digestive juices of the small intestine, pancreas, and ''liver'' (bile) and to be absorbed well from the intestine. The metering process by which solid and liquid foods are emptied from the stomach is a result of a combination of relaxation of the muscle in parts of the stomach designed to accommodate (store) food, and the pressure generated by the muscle in other parts of the stomach that pushes the food into the small intestine. (Thus, the stomach can store and empty food at the same time.) The metering also is controlled by the opening and closing of the pylorus, the muscular opening of the stomach into the small intestine.'""When the contractions of the stomach's muscles are weakened, food is not thoroughly ground and does not empty into the intestine normally. Since the muscular actions whereby solid food and liquid food are emptied from the stomach are slightly different, the emptying of solids and liquids follows different time courses, and there may be slow emptying of solid food (most common), solid and liquid food (less common), or liquid food alone (least common).""  "
What causes gastroparesis?,"""Gastroparesis can be caused either by diseases of the stomach's muscles or the nerves that control the muscles, though often no specific cause is identified. The most common disease causing gastroparesis is ""'diabetes mellitus'', which damages the nerves controlling the stomach muscles.'""Gastroparesis also can result from damage to the vagus nerve, the nerve that controls the stomach's muscles, that occurs during surgery on the ""'esophagus'' and stomach. ''Scleroderma'"" is an example of a disease in which gastroparesis is due to damage to the stomach's muscles. Occasionally, gastroparesis is caused by reflexes within the nervous system, for example, when the pancreas is inflamed (""'pancreatitis''). In such cases, neither the nerves nor the muscles of the stomach are diseased, but messages are sent through nerves from the pancreas to the stomach, which prevents the muscles from working normally.''Other causes of gastroparesis include imbalances of ''minerals'' in the blood such as potassium, calcium or magnesium, medications (such as narcotic ''pain''-relievers), and ''thyroid disease''. For a substantial number of patients no cause can be found for the gastroparesis, a condition termed idiopathic gastroparesis. Indeed, idiopathic gastroparesis is the second most frequent cause of gastroparesis after ''diabetes''.''Gastroparesis can occur as an isolated problem or it can be associated with weakness of the muscles of other parts of the intestine, including the small intestine, colon, and esophagus.'  "
What are gastroparesis symptoms and signs?,"'The primary symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea and vomiting. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include ''bloating'' with or without abdominal distension, early satiety (feeling full quickly when eating), and in severe cases, ''weight loss'' due to a reduced intake of food because of the symptoms. ''Abdominal pain'' also is present frequently though the cause of the ''pain'' is unclear. Reduced intake of food and restriction of the types of food that are eaten can lead to nutritional deficiencies.''The vomiting of gastroparesis usually occurs after meals; however, with severe gastroparesis, vomiting may occur without eating due simply to the accumulation of secretions in the stomach. The characteristic vomiting happens several hours after a meal when the stomach is maximally distended by the presence of food and secretions stimulated by the meal. Since the grinding action of the stomach is absent, the vomited food often contains larger pieces of recognizable food. (This can be contrasted with the more common type of vomiting in which the food appears as small, uniform, unidentifiable particles.)''Other, less frequent effects of gastroparesis are the promotion of ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'') and malnutrition.'  "
How is gastroparesis diagnosed?,"'The most common method for diagnosing gastroparesis is a nuclear medicine test called a gastric emptying study, which measures the emptying of food from the stomach. For this study, a patient eats a meal in which the solid food, liquid food, or both contain a small amount of radioactive material. A scanner (acting like a Geiger counter) is placed over the stomach for several hours to monitor the amount of radioactivity in the stomach. In patients with gastroparesis, the food takes longer than normal (usually more than several hours) to empty into the intestine.''The ''antro-duodenal motility study'' is a study that can be considered experimental and is reserved for selected patients. An antro-duodenal motility study measures the pressure that is generated by the contractions of the muscles of the stomach and intestine. This study is conducted by passing a thin tube through the nose, down the esophagus, through the stomach and into the small intestine. With this tube, the strength of the contractions of the muscles of the stomach and small intestine can be measured at rest and following a meal. In most patients with gastroparesis, food (which normally causes the stomach to contract vigorously) causes either infrequent contractions (if the nerves are diseased) or only very weak contractions (if the muscle is diseased).''An ''electrogastrogram'', another experimental study that sometimes is done in patients with suspected gastroparesis, is similar to an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') of the ''heart'"". The electrogastrogram is a recording of the electrical signals that travel through the stomach muscles and control the muscles' contractions. An electrogastrogram is performed by taping several electrodes onto a patient's abdomen over the stomach area in the same manner as electrodes are placed on the chest for an EKG. The electrical signals coming from the stomach that reach the electrodes on the abdomen are recorded at rest and after a meal. In normal individuals, there is a regular electrical rhythm just as in the heart, and the power (voltage) of the electrical current increases after the meal. In most patients with gastroparesis, the rhythm is not normal or there is no increase in electrical power after the meal. Although the gastric emptying study is the primary test for diagnosing gastroparesis, there are patients with gastroparesis who have a normal gastric emptying study but an abnormal electrogastrogram. Therefore, the electrogastrogram can be useful primarily when the suspicion for gastroparesis is high but the gastric emptying study is normal or borderline abnormal.""'A physical obstruction to the emptying of the stomach, for example, a ''tumor'' that compresses the outlet from the stomach or scarring from an ulcer, may cause symptoms that are similar to gastroparesis. Therefore, an upper gastrointestinal (GI) ''endoscopy'"" test usually is performed to exclude the possibility of an obstruction as the cause of a patient's symptoms. (Upper GI endoscopy involves the swallowing of a tube with a camera on the end and can be used to visually examine the stomach and duodenum and take biopsies.)""'Upper GI endoscopy also may be useful for diagnosing one of the complications of gastroparesis, a bezoar (a clump or wad of swallowed food or hair). Because of the poor emptying of the stomach, hard to digest components of the ''diet'', usually from vegetables, are retained and accumulate in the stomach. A ball of undigested, plant-derived material can accumulate in the stomach and give rise to symptoms of fullness or can further obstruct the emptying of food from the stomach. Removing the bezoar may improve symptoms and emptying.''A computerized tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen and upper gastrointestinal X-ray series also may be necessary to exclude ''cancer of the pancreas'' or other conditions that can obstruct the emptying of the stomach.''An alternative method of looking at gastric emptying is a large capsule (SmartPill) that is swallowed. The capsule measures pressure, acidity and temperature, and then transmits the measurements wirelessly to a recorder. By analyzing the measurements it can be determined how long it takes the capsule to empty from the stomach, and the amount of time necessary for emptying correlates well with other measures of gastric emptying.'  "
What is the treatment for gastroparesis and its symptoms?,"'Treatment of gastroparesis includes ''diet'', medication, and devices or procedures that facilitate emptying of the stomach. The goals of treatment include:''Emptying from the stomach is faster when there is less food to empty, so smaller, more frequent portions of food are recommended. Soft foods (or preferably liquid) that do not require grinding also are emptied more easily. Moreover, in gastroparesis, the emptying of liquids often is less severely affected than the emptying of solids. Fat causes the release of hormones that slow down the emptying of the stomach. Therefore, foods low in fat empty faster from the stomach. In patients with severe gastroparesis, sometimes only liquid meals are tolerated. It also is recommended that the diet be low in ''fiber'' (for example, vegetables) due to the concern about the formation of bezoars, and the fact that fiber slows gastric emptying - at least in normal individuals.''Food should be chewed well since the grinding action of the stomach is reduced. Meals should be taken with enough liquids to ensure maximal liquidity of contents in the stomach since liquids usually empty better than solid food; however, if liquid emptying also is slow, too much liquid might create problems. (Only trial and error will determine the effects of increased liquids.) Patients with gastroparesis should have most food early in the day, especially the solid food; they should not lie down for 4-5 hours after their last meal, since when lying, the assistance of gravity on gastric emptying is lost. ''Multivitamins'' should be taken because of the likelihood of malnutrition and vitamin and mineral deficiencies.'   To provide a diet containing foods that are more easily emptied from the stomach. Controlling underlying conditions that may be aggravating gastroparesis. Relieve symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Stimulate muscle activity in the stomach so that food is properly ground and emptied from the stomach Maintaining adequate nutrition."
What medications treat gastroparesis?,"'It has been demonstrated that ''tegaserod'' (''Zelnorm''), an oral drug used for treating ''constipation'' in ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS''), increases emptying from the stomach just as it does from the colon. However, in March of 2007, the FDA asked Novartis to suspend sales of tegaserod ) in the United States because a retrospective analysis of data by Novartis from more than 18,000 patients showed a slight difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events (''heart attacks'', ''strokes'', and ''angina'') among patients on tegaserod compared to placebo. The data showed that cardiovascular events occurred in 13 out of 11,614 patients treated with tegaserod (0.1%), compared to one cardiovascular event in 7,031 (0.01%) placebo-treated patients. However, it is unclear whether tegaserod actually causes ''heart attacks'' and strokes. Despite this fact, the availability of tegaserod in the U.S. is limited to emergency situations.''There are two important guidelines in prescribing oral drugs for gastroparesis. First, the drugs must be given at the right times, and second, the drugs must reach the small intestine so that they can be absorbed into the body. Since the goal of treatment is to stimulate muscular contractions during and immediately after a meal, drugs that stimulate contractions should be given before meals.''Most drugs must be emptied from the stomach so that they can be absorbed in the small intestine. The majority of patients with gastroparesis have delayed emptying of solid food as well as pills and capsules. As mentioned previously, many patients with gastroparesis have less of a problem emptying liquids as compared with solid food. Therefore, liquid medications usually are more effective than pills or capsules.''Occasionally, patients have such poor emptying of both liquid and solid food from the stomach that only drugs given intravenously are effective. In such patients, intravenous metoclopramide or erythromycin can be used. A third option is octreotide (''Sandostatin''), a hormone-like drug that can be injected beneath the skin. Like erythromycin, octreotide stimulates short bursts of strong contractions of the muscles in the stomach and small intestine. Due to its greater expense and the need for injection, octreotide is used only when other medications fail.' Oral Drugs: There are four oral drugs that are used to stimulate contractions of the stomach's muscles, referred to as pro-motility drugs. These drugs are 1) cisapride (Propulsid), 2) domperidone, 3) metoclopramide (Reglan), and 4) erythromycin. Cisapride (Propulsid) is an effective drug for treating gastroparesis; however, it was removed from the market because it can cause serious and life-threatening irregular heart rhythms. Despite this fact, it can be obtained for use through the pharmaceutical company that manufactures it (Janssen Pharmaceuticals) under a strictly monitored protocol but only for patients with severe gastroparesis unresponsive to all other measures. Domperidone has not been released for use in the US; however, it too can be obtained if approval is obtained for its use from the US Food and Drug Administration. Metoclopramide (Reglan) is available without restriction and is effective at promoting muscular activity in the stomach; however, there are side effects of metoclopramide that can limit its use. Erythromycin (E-Mycin, Ilosone, etc.), is a uncommonly used antibiotic. At doses lower than those used to treat infections, erythromycin stimulates contractions of the muscles of the stomach and small intestine and is useful for treating gastroparesis."
Controlling underlying conditions and maintaining nutrition,"'High levels of glucose (''sugar'') in blood tends to slow gastric emptying. Therefore, it is important to lower blood glucose levels in patients with ''diabetes'' to near normal levels with diets and medications. Individuals with a deficiency of ''thyroid hormone'' (''hypothyroidism'') should be treated with thyroid hormone. If bezoars are present, they should be removed (usually endoscopically).''Patients with mild gastroparesis usually can be successfully managed with pain relievers and pro-motility medications, but patients with severe gastroparesis often require repeated hospitalizations to correct ''dehydration'', malnutrition and to control symptoms.''Treatment options for ''dehydration'' and malnutrition include:''Enteral nutrition is safe and effective. The two common means of delivering enteral nutrition are via naso-jejunal tubes or jejunostomy tubes. The jejunum is the part of the small intestine just past the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine just beyond the stomach. Both naso-jejunal tubes and jejunostomy tubes are designed to bypass the stomach and deliver nutrients into the jejunum where they can be absorbed.''A naso-jejunal tube is a long, thin catheter inserted (usually by a radiologist or a ''gastroenterologist'') via the nostril into the stomach. The tip of the naso-jejunal tube is then advanced past the stomach into the small intestine. Often this must be done during upper GI endoscopy. Liquid nutrients then can be delivered via the naso-jejunal tube into the small intestine. Naso-jejunal tubes generally are safe, but there are cosmetic disadvantages and discomfort of having a tube in the nose. The problems that occur with naso-jejunal tubes are primarily accidental or intentional removal by the patient, blockage of the tube by solidified nutritional solutions, and aspiration (backup of stomach contents into the ''lungs'' that can lead to ''pneumonia'').''A jejunostomy is a catheter placed directly into the jejunum. It can be done during standard abdominal surgery, using minimally invasive techniques (''laparoscopy''), or by a specially-trained radiologist. With a jejunostomy, the catheter passes through the skin on the abdominal wall and directly into the jejunum. Before a jejunostomy is placed, a trial of naso-jejunal nutrition often is given to be certain that the small bowel is not involved with the same motility problem as the stomach and that nutritional liquids infused into the small intestine will be tolerated.' Intravenous fluids to correct dehydration and replenish electrolytes if nutrition is adequate but symptoms occasionally interrupt the intake of even liquid food. Enteral nutrition which provides liquid food directly into the small intestine, bypassing the paralyzed stomach. Intravenous total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to provide calories and nutrients (TPN is a fluid containing glucose, amino acids, lipids, minerals, and vitamins-everything that is needed for adequate nutrition-intravenously. The fluid usually is delivered into a large vein via a catheter in the arm or upper chest.) Doctors generally prefer enteral nutrition over TPN because long-term use of TPN is associated with infections of the catheter and liver damage. Infection can spread through the blood to the rest of the body, a serious condition called sepsis. Catheter-related sepsis often requires treatment with intravenous antibiotics and removal of the infected catheter or replacement with a new catheter. TPN also can damage the liver, most commonly causing abnormal liver tests in the blood. TPN-induced liver damage usually is mild and reversible (the liver test abnormalities return to normal after cessation of TPN), but, rarely, irreversible liver failure can occur. Such liver failure may require liver transplantation."
What drugs relieve pain and nausea from gastroparesis?,"'Drugs used to relieve nausea and vomiting'' in gastroparesis include promotility drugs (see discussion that follows) such as metoclopramide (Reglan) and domperidone, ''anti-nausea'' medications such as ''prochlorperazine'' (''Compazine'') and ''promethazine'' (Phenergan), serotonin antagonists such as ''ondansetron'' (''Zofran''), anticholinergic drugs such as a ''scopolamine'' patch (commonly used for treating ''motion sickness''), drugs used for treating nausea in ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy'' patients such as ''aprepitant'' (''Emend''), and ''medical marijuana'' (''Marinol'').''Drugs used to relieve abdominal pain'' in gastroparesis include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'') and ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), low dose ''tricyclic antidepressants'' such as ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil'', ''Endep''), drugs that block nerves that sense pain such as ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin''), and narcotics such as ''tramadol'' (''Ultram'') and ''fentanyl'' (''Duragesic''). (Nevertheless, narcotics as a group tend to cause ''constipation'' and slow emptying of the stomach, and, therefore, should be avoided or used with caution in patients with gastroparesis.' "
Is there surgery to treat gastroparesis?,"'Electrical pacing: ''Electrical pacing of the stomach is a newer method for treating severe gastroparesis. Electrical pacing of the stomach is analogous to cardiac pacing for the treatment of an abnormally slow heartbeat and involves the placement of a ''pacemaker''. The pacemaker usually is placed laparoscopically and does not require a large abdominal incision for entering the abdomen. During placement, wire electrodes are attached to the muscle of the stomach. The wires are brought out through the abdominal wall just beneath the skin. The wires are attached to a small, battery-operated pacemaker that is buried in a surgically-created pouch just under the skin. The skin is then sutured so that the pacemaker and wires are beneath the skin. The pacemaker generates electrical impulses that are transmitted by the wires to the muscles of the stomach, and the muscles contract in response to the impulses. Electrical pacing is effective in many patients with severe gastroparesis, but the numbers of patients who have been treated is small.''Surgery: '""Surgery occasionally is used to treat gastroparesis. The goal of surgery is to create a larger opening between the stomach and the intestine in order to aid the process of emptying the stomach's contents. Alternatively, the entire stomach may be removed. These procedures should be considered only when all other measures have failed because of the potential complications from the surgery. Surgery should be done only by surgeons in consultation with gastroenterologists who are knowledgeable and experienced in caring for patients with gastrointestinal motility disorders (disorders of the nerves or muscles of the gastrointestinal tract that affect ""'digestion'' and transport of food).'

What is the prognosis (long-term outcome) for patients with gastroparesis?,"'If gastroparesis is caused by a reversible problem, for example pancreatitis, the condition will subside when the underlying problem resolves. In some people with ''diabetes'', better control of their blood ''sugar'' will improve emptying of the stomach. If there is no reversible cause, gastroparesis rarely resolves. In fact, it may become worse with time. Gastroparesis is particularly difficult to treat when there are accompanying motility disorders of the muscles of the small intestine.' "
What is new in gastroparesis?,"'The newest experimental treatment for gastroparesis is injection of botulinum toxin into the pylorus. The pylorus is the narrow channel through which food passes from the stomach to the duodenum. The pylorus, like the stomach, is a muscular organ. The pylorus is closed most of the time due to continuous contraction of the pyloric muscle. Intermittently it opens and allows secretions from the stomach to enter the small intestine. After meals, the pylorus is very important for metering the emptying of the stomach. In gastroparesis, although the muscles of the stomach are weak all of the time, the muscle of the pylorus remains strong and contracted and the pylorus relatively closed. It was hypothesized that if the strength of the pyloric muscle was reduced, food might empty from the stomach more readily. Although the initial results were good, subsequent studies have not confirmed the benefit of botulinum toxin. Although the initial results with botulinium toxin were good, subsequent studies have not confirmed the benefit. Its use should be considered experimental.''Although a surgical procedure, termed pyloroplasty, to enlarge the pylorus has been used in the past to treat problems with emptying of the stomach, it is major surgery and has had mixed results with respect to its efficacy.' "
Facts you should know about labor and delivery,"""Every woman's experience is unique. Below are typical guidelines that will help you understand what to expect during ""'labor'' and delivery.' Normal labor can begin three weeks prior to the anticipated due date up until two weeks afterwards. There is no way to precisely predict when labor will begin. In the first stage of labor the cervix dilates and effaces (thins out). Once contractions begin, they usually increase in strength, duration, and frequency. The second stage of labor begins when the cervix is completely (i.e. 10 centimeters) dilated. It ends when, following expulsive efforts (pushing) by the mother, the infant is delivered. During the third stage of labor, the placenta and membranes are delivered. There are a number of methods for monitoring the fetus that may be used during labor. Options for pain control during labor include breathing exercises, imagery, relaxation techniques, medications, and regional anesthesia."
What are the early symptoms and signs of labor?,"'Signs and symptoms of impending labor are not uniform among all women.''Early symptoms and signs that labor is approaching are ""lightening"" and passing the mucous plug.''Lightening is a term used to denote the descent of the fetal head into the pelvis as labor approaches. It can occur up to two weeks prior to the onset of labor, or it may not occur at all. At that time, there may be increased pressure on the maternal bladder accompanied by the urge to urinate more frequently. Many women find it easier to breathe after lightening occurs because upward pressure on the ''diaphragm'' diminishes.''Release or passage of the ""''mucus'' plug"" can be another sign that labor is near. Mucus produced by the cervical glands normally blocks the entrance to the cervix and helps prevent infection. When the fetal head impinges on the cervix, mucus from the cervical glands, along with a small amount of blood, is expelled. This results in a blood-tinged or brownish discharge being expelled from the vagina. Passage of the mucus plug may occur days before or after labor begins. It is also common after a vaginal examination.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs that labor is near or has begun?,"'Spontaneous rupture of the fetal membranes is referred to as one\'s ""water breaking."" This means that the membranes that surround the baby have ruptured, and clear ''amniotic fluid'' is often expelled from the vagina at that time. Once this occurs, labor will generally ensue spontaneously. If it does not, induction of labor may be necessary to avoid infection ascending upward through the vagina into the uterus. Most commonly rupture of the membranes does not occur until labor has already begun.''Finally, labor begins with the onset of contractions. At that point, the cervix begins to thin out and dilate. When contractions begin to occur less than ten minutes apart, this frequently signals the onset of labor. Irregular contractions, known as Braxton-Hicks contractions or ""''false labor'',"" occur toward the end of ''pregnancy'' during the ''third trimester'', and they do not necessarily signify that labor is imminent. Some women even experience these contractions during the ''second trimester''. Braxton-Hicks contractions are usually milder than those of ''true labor'' are, and they do not occur at regular intervals.' "
What are the stages of labor and delivery?,"'Labor is divided into three stages; corresponding to the dilation of the cervix, the birth of the baby, and the delivery of the placenta.' "
Stage 1 of labor and delivery,"'Stage 1 is the longest stage of labor. It is characterized by thinning (effacement) and dilation of the cervix. Sometimes doctors subdivide this stage into three separate phases: the latent phase, the active phase, and the transition phase. Contractions, occurring with increasing frequency, are present during all phases of Stage 1. Early contractions last from 30 to 45 seconds and are several minutes apart. During the latent phase, the cervix dilates to about 3 to 4 centimeters. Many women are admitted to the hospital during this phase. In the active phase, the cervix dilates to about 7 centimeters, and the contractions become more intense. During the transition phase, the cervix dilates completely to 10 centimeters, and the contractions are strong and painful. Contractions can occur every 3 to 4 minutes and last from 60 to 90 seconds.' "
Stage 2 of labor and delivery,"'Stage 2 refers to the passage of the baby through the birth canal until delivery. It begins when the cervix has fully dilated and voluntary pushing is initiated. Sometimes this is referred to as the ''""pushing"" stage'"". The head is typically delivered first, and sustained pushing allows for delivery of the infant's shoulders and body. Some women prefer different body positions during this stage of labor. These may include kneeling, squatting, lying down, or even on the hands and knees. This stage may take minutes to a few hours. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a woman giving birth for the first time should complete Stage 2 within 2 hours if no regional anesthesia has been used, and up to 3 hours if she has received anesthesia. Stage 2 is usually shorter in subsequent ""'pregnancies'', up to 2 hours if anesthesia has been given and 1 hour if none has been used.' "
Stage 3 of labor and delivery,"'Stage 3 begins at the time the infant is delivered. In stage 3, the placenta and fetal membranes are expelled. The placenta and membranes are sometimes referred to as the ''afterbirth''. Stage 3 usually takes only 5 to 10 minutes, but it can take up to 30 minutes. Mild contractions may occur during stage 3, and there may be some associated bleeding.' "
What are pain control options during labor and delivery?,"'Many women opt not to receive medications or interventions for ''pain'' control during labor and delivery, while others choose medical or procedural pain control methods. Several different opioid analgesic and opioid agonist medications are acceptable for pain control. Examples are''Regional anesthesia is another option. This can be administered as an epidural, spinal, or combined spinal-epidural block. Research has shown that regional anesthesia is more effective than injectable medications for controlling pain. Moreover, large-scale ''clinical trials'' did not show an increase in the ''C-section'' rate in women who opted for regional anesthesia.''Women who choose not to receive pain medications can use breathing techniques and/or imagery for pain control. Relaxation techniques and ''yoga'' have also proved beneficial.'  injectable meperidine, fentanyl, morphine, butorphanol (Stadol), and nalbuphine (Nubain)."
What kind of monitoring is done during labor and delivery?," During the first stage of labor, you will likely have pelvic examinations to check the dilation and thinning of the cervix. The baby's heart rate is usually checked intermittently with a Doppler device, or continuous electronic fetal monitoring may be employed. External fetal monitoring is accomplished by placing a transducer on the maternal abdominal wall. The transducer detects the fetal heart rate and displays it on a visual tracing. Internal monitoring is another method used to follow the fetal heartbeat. With this technology, a small electrode is passed through the cervix and attached to the fetal scalp. The type of monitoring selected depends upon a number of factors, and it will vary from patient to patient. Your health-care professional will choose the most appropriate type for your individual situation. Continuous fetal monitoring is almost universally used if the woman receives epidural anesthesia, or if oxytocin (Pitocin) is used to induce labor. It is also employed with high-risk pregnancies or if the labor is complicated."
What is dementia?,"'Dementia is often one of the most misunderstood conditions in medicine today. Some people believe that senility or senile dementia is an inevitable result of ''aging'', and never seek evaluation for family members who show signs of memory loss. Others believe that any evidence of forgetfulness is evidence of dementia. Neither of these conclusions is accurate.''Additionally, many questions have been raised about dementia. Does dementia differ from '""Alzheimer's""' disease or are all forms of dementia '""Alzheimer's"""" disease? If someone has memory loss associated with another condition, does that turn into Alzheimer's disease? What can be expected if someone has been diagnosed with dementia?""  "
What are the early and later signs and symptoms of dementia?,"'Early signs of dementia may include:''Many patients with '""early Alzheimer's disease""' or other types of dementia are unaware that they have any problem. As the disease progresses, behavioral changes can become evident.' Simple forgetfulness Losing items Problems performing tasks or activities that were previously done without effort. Difficulty with learning new material is frequently one of the earliest signs of dementia. Patients have difficulty performing basic tasks, such as getting dressed or using the bathroom. Some patients begin to forget pieces of information about themselves, including their address or telephone number, or even their date of birth. They may have difficulty understanding what is occurring around them. Some patients have problems remembering to eat and may develop pronounced weight loss. In the late stages of dementia, patients often cannot recognize family members and their ability to communicate effectively is markedly impaired. They are no longer able to effectively care for themselves and require assistance for all activities of daily living. Over time, patients can forget how to walk or even how to sit up."
What causes dementia?,"""Dementia is a broad term which covers many different conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, ""'frontotemporal dementia'', and other disorders.''They may repeat questions or stories regularly, or forget appointments. They may get lost in familiar environments. Personality changes, including irritability or agitation, may also occur. In some cases, people with dementia develop ''hallucinations'"" (or see things which aren't really there)."" Simple forgetfulness is not enough to lead to a diagnosis of dementia, as there needs to be evidence of problems in at least two areas of cognition (brain function) to confirm this diagnosis. Possible symptoms or signs of dementia include: Memory loss. Problems with speaking including difficulty completing sentences or finding the right word to say Difficulty completing tasks. Difficulty recognizing items or people. Showing signs of poor judgment. People with dementia may have problems preparing food. Performing household chores Paying bills."
"What are Alzheimer's, vascular, and frontotemporal dementia?","   Alzheimer’s dementia/Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The cause has not yet been identified. While patients with AD have amyloid plaques (an accumulation of an abnormal protein) identified in certain areas of their brain, it is unclear if these plaques are the cause of the disease or a result of the disease. Although most cases of Alzheimer's disease begin after the age of 65, in some cases symptoms begin when someone is in their 40s or 50s. This early onset Alzheimer's disease can progress more rapidly than later onset AD. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia, and is due to multiple strokes occurring within the brain. Often, these strokes may have been unnoticed and patients may not have any associated symptoms such as weakness, visual loss, or numbness. Patients with untreated high blood pressure or heart disease may be at risk of developing vascular dementia. Frontotemporal dementia is associated with pronounced atrophy or shrinkage of the frontal and temporal lobes in the brain. In addition to forgetfulness and word finding problems, patients may have marked personality changes, impulsivity, or poor judgment. Some patients with frontotemporal dementia can develop incoordination or stiffness of their muscles."
"What are hydrocephalus, alcoholic, Hunington's, and trauma dementia?"," Normal pressure hydrocephalus is an abnormal enlargement of the ventricles, or fluid filled spaces within the brain, that causes pressure on areas of the brain. This leads to problems with walking, memory, and ability to control urine flow (incontinence). Although this can be identified with imaging of the brain (MRI or CT scan), further testing may be required to confirm the diagnosis. If diagnosed, this condition can be treated with placement of a shunt to drain the extra fluid. Huntington’s disease causes characteristic abnormal movements, called chorea, in affected individuals. The movements are the hallmark of the diagnosis. However, in some cases, problems with memory can precede the development of the chorea by many years. Alcoholic dementia is caused when patients drink heavily and develop deficiency in one of the B vitamins. When this happens, brain cells are unable to function normally and memory loss can occur. This is called Korsakoff syndrome. Although it is most commonly seen in alcoholics, patients who are malnourished from other causes are also at risk of developing this disorder. Traumatic brain injury (concussion)/dementia) pugilistica can lead to memory problems, as we have learned in recent years. In some cases, recurrent brain injuries or repeated concussions can contribute to the underlying changes identified in Alzheimer's disease."
"What are Lewy body, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and mixed dementia"," Lewy body dementia/Lewy body disease is caused by Lewy bodies, which are abnormal clumps of certain proteins, accumulating inside of neurons. Forgetfulness and other signs of cognitive decline are the primary features of this condition, but patients can also develop prominent hallucinations which seem very real to them. Some patients with Lewy body disease develop symptoms which look like Parkinson's disease, such as tremor and slowness. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare condition where an abnormal protein leads to destruction of brain cells and dementia. While most cases occur without an underlying cause, in some patients there is a family history of this disorder. Even less often, patients might be exposed to the abnormal protein. Mad cow disease is one example of external exposure. This condition tends to progress rapidly, over only a few years, and is often associated with abnormal muscle movements. Mixed dementia refers to patients who have evidence of two (or more) types of dementia. They are often described as having mixed dementia. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia are the most common causes of mixed dementia."
What are the stages of dementia?,"'The stages of dementia are loosely grouped into mild, moderate, and severe categories by some doctors. However, there is another system of staging for dementia.'""Patients may seem to fall into two different stages at the same time, depending on what symptoms they are experiencing. The different stages of dementia cannot be used to predict how rapidly someone's condition might progress and patients may remain in one stage for many years or for only a few months. Every patient has a different progression of their disease.""  Stage 1: No cognitive decline. Stage 2: Mild cognitive decline. Stage 3: Moderate cognitive decline, for example, dementia impairment like memory lapses, and losing objects daily. Stage 4: Moderately severe cognitive decline, for example, poor short-term memory, forgetting personal details, and difficulty with basic math. This is usually is the longest stage of dementia. Stage 5: Moderately severe cognitive decline, for example, increasing problems planning or organizing, disorientation, and may no longer be able to live alone. Stage 6: Severe cognitive decline, for example, problems recognizing friends and family members, and memory loss that worsens. Stage 7: Very severe cognitive decline. This is the final stage of dementia. Body systems decline, and communication is limited."
What are the risk factors for dementia?,"""The risk factors for developing dementia include age and family history. Age and a family history of dementia are non-modifiable risk factors. Abnormal genes which are associated with Alzheimer's disease have been identified, but are only rarely involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Conditions such as ""'high blood pressure'', high ''cholesterol'', or ''diabetes'"" increase the risks of developing either Alzheimer's disease or ""'multi-infarct dementia''. Some medications can lead to memory problems which look like dementia.'  "
How is dementia diagnosed?,"'To diagnosis dementia, testing is performed by doctors. While in-office screening assessments are sometimes enough to confirm a diagnosis, at other times a more in-depth evaluation is required. Blood testing and imaging studies are often completed to confirm that reversible conditions such as ''thyroid disease'' or certain vitamin deficiencies are not present.'  "
What is the treatment for dementia?,"""Treatment options for Alzheimer's disease and other dementia are limited. While there are medications available to try to improve the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, the effect of these medications is limited. Physical ""'exercise'"" has been shown to be of some benefit in helping to maintain cognition. Staying engaged and participating in social events may also be of some help. To date, no treatment which can reverse the process of Alzheimer's disease has been identified."" "
What is the life expectancy for dementia? Can it be cured?,"'There is no cure for dementia.' Although Alzheimer's disease is listed as the 6th most common cause of death in the U.S.. Patients with Alzheimer's disease most commonly die due to infections caused by lack of mobility. Pneumonia, bladder infections, bedsores, and other causes can lead to more wide-spread infection and subsequent death. Patients with dementias have widely varying life expectancies, depending on the underlying cause of their dementia. Life expectancy can range from only 1 to 2 years to more than 15 years; the average duration of the disease is between 4 and 8 years after diagnosis."
How can you cope with being the caretaker of someone with dementia?,"'It is important for someone who is the primary ''caregiver'' of a patient with dementia to have a strong network of support. This is needed both to aid in caring for the patient and to give the caregiver some intermittent relief. In the early stages, many caregivers function more as a helper or guide, providing reminders for different tasks. Later in the disease, caregivers may have to supply basic care to the patient, including assistance with bathing, dressing, and going to the bathroom.''Obtaining ''power of attorney'"" status for financial and medical matters and determining when a patient is no longer able to perform certain activities, such as driving, are difficult but necessary actions. Local Alzheimer's Association chapters are often helpful in completing these tasks. Enlisting the help of a patient's physician or mandating an on-the-road driving assessment can place the responsibility of determining when a patient is no longer safe to drive on someone other than a caregiver or family member, as driving is often an action that many patients attempt to perform far past the time when it is safe to continue. There are many sources of assistance for caregivers of patients with dementia:""""Alzheimer's and Dementia Caregiver Center""""Alzheimer's Association""   Early-Stage Caregiving Middle-Stage Caregiving Late-Stage Caregiving"
Can dementia be prevented?,"'While there is no way to absolutely prevent the development of dementia, different activities have been identified which might decrease the risk. These include maintaining optimal health, including normal ''blood pressure'', normal cholesterol, and normal blood sugars. Staying physically active, avoiding tobacco use or excess alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and preventing head injuries are also recommended.' "
Lewy body dementia (LBD) introduction,"""\tLBD is a disease associated with abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the brain.

What are Lewy bodies?,"'\tLewy bodies are named for Dr. Friederich Lewy, a German neurologist. In 1912, he discovered abnormal protein deposits that disrupt the brain\'s normal functioning in people with Parkinson\'s disease. These abnormal deposits are now called ""Lewy bodies.""''\tLewy bodies are made of a protein called alpha-synuclein. In the healthy brain, a protein associated with alpha-synuclein plays a number of important roles in neurons (nerve cells) in the brain, especially at synapses, where brain cells communicate with each other. In LBD, alpha-synuclein forms into clumps inside neurons throughout the brain. This process may cause neurons to work less effectively and, eventually, to die. The activities of brain chemicals important to brain function are also affected. The result is widespread damage to certain parts of the brain and a decline in abilities affected by those brain regions.''\tLewy bodies affect a few different brain regions in LBD:' 
		the cerebral cortex, which controls many functions, including information processing, perception, thought, and language 
		the limbic cortex, which plays a major role in emotions and behavior 
		the hippocampus, which is essential to forming new memories 
		the midbrain, including the substantia nigra, which is involved in movement 
		areas of the brain stem important in regulating sleep and maintaining alertness

What are the types of Lewy body dementia (LBD)?,"'\tLewy body dementia includes two related conditions - dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease dementia. The difference between them lies largely in the timing of cognitive (thinking) and movement symptoms.

What are the causes and risk factors for Lewy body dementia (LBD)?,"'\tThe precise cause of LBD is unknown, but scientists are learning more about its biology and genetics. For example, they know that an accumulation of Lewy bodies is associated with a loss of certain neurons in the brain that produce two important neurotransmitters, chemicals that act as messengers between brain cells. One of these messengers, acetylcholine, is important for memory and learning. The other, dopamine, plays an important role in behavior, cognition, movement, motivation, ''sleep'', and mood.''\tScientists are also learning about risk factors for LBD. Age is considered the greatest risk factor. Most people who develop the disorder are over age 50.''\tOther known risk factors for LBD include the following:' 
Diseases and health conditions: Certain diseases and health conditions, particularly Parkinson's disease and REM sleep behavior disorder, are linked to a higher risk of LBD. 
Genetics: While having a family member with LBD may increase a person's risk, LBD is not normally considered a genetic disease. A small percentage of families with dementia with Lewy bodies has a genetic association, but in most cases, the cause is unknown. At this time, no genetic test can accurately predict whether someone will develop LBD. Future genetic research may reveal more information about causes and risk. 
Lifestyle: No specific lifestyle factor has been proven to increase one's risk for LBD. However, some studies suggest that a healthy lifestyle - including regular exercise, mental stimulation, and a healthy diet - might reduce the chance of developing age-associated dementias."
What are the common symptoms of Lewy body dementia (LBD)?,"'\tPeople with LBD may not have every LBD symptom, and the severity of symptoms can vary greatly from person to person. Throughout the course of the disease, any sudden, major change in functional ability or behavior should be reported to a doctor.''''\tThe most common symptoms include changes in cognition, movement, sleep, and behavior.' "
Cognitive symptoms of Lewy body dementia,"'\tLBD causes changes in thinking abilities. These changes may include:''''Dementia:'"" Severe loss of thinking abilities that interferes with a person's capacity to perform daily activities. Dementia is a primary symptom in LBD and usually includes trouble with visual and spatial abilities (judging distance and depth or misidentifying objects), multitasking, problem solving, and reasoning. Memory problems may not be evident at first but often arise as LBD progresses. Dementia can also include changes in mood and behavior, poor judgment, loss of initiative, ""'confusion'' about time and place, and difficulty with language and numbers.''''Cognitive fluctuations:'' Unpredictable changes in ''concentration'', attention, alertness, and wakefulness from day to day and sometimes throughout the day. A person with LBD may stare into space for periods of time, seem drowsy and lethargic, and sleep for several hours during the day despite getting enough sleep the night before. His or her flow of ideas may be disorganized, unclear, or illogical at times. The person may seem better one day, then worse the next day. These cognitive fluctuations are common in LBD but are not always easy for a doctor to identify.''''Hallucinations:'' Seeing or ''hearing'' things that are not present. Visual hallucinations occur in up to 80 percent of people with LBD, often early on. They are typically realistic and detailed, such as images of children or animals. Auditory hallucinations are less common than visual ones but may also occur. Hallucinations that are not disruptive may not require treatment. However, if they are frightening or dangerous (for example, if the person attempts to fight a perceived intruder), then a doctor may prescribe medication.' "
Behavoiral and mood symptoms of Lewy body dementia,"'\tChanges in behavior and mood are possible in LBD. These changes may include:' 
Depression: A persistent feeling of sadness, inability to enjoy activities, and trouble with sleeping, eating, and other normal activities. 
Apathy: A lack of interest in normal daily activities or events, and less social interaction. 
Anxiety: Intense apprehension, uncertainty, or fear about a future event or situation. A person may ask the same questions over and over or be angry or fearful when a loved one is not present. 
Agitation: Restlessness, as seen by pacing, hand wringing, an inability to get settled, constant repeating of words or phrases, or irritability. 
Delusions: Strongly held false beliefs or opinions not based on evidence. For example, a person may think his or her spouse is having an affair or that relatives long dead are still living. A delusion that may be seen in LBD is Capgras syndrome, in which the person believes a relative or friend has been replaced by an imposter. 
Paranoia: An extreme, irrational distrust of others, such as suspicion that people are taking or hiding things."
Sleep disorders associated with Lewy body dementia,"'\tSleep disorders are common in people with LBD but are often undiagnosed. A sleep specialist can play an important role on a treatment team, helping to diagnose and treat sleep disorders. Sleep-related disorders seen in people with LBD may include:''''REM sleep behavior disorder:'' A condition in which a person seems to act out dreams. It may include vivid dreaming, talking in one’s sleep, violent movements, or falling out of bed. Sometimes only the bed partner of the person with LBD is aware of these symptoms. REM sleep behavior disorder appears in some people years before other LBD symptoms.''''Excessive daytime sleepiness:'' Sleeping 2 or more hours a day.''''Insomnia:'' Difficulty falling or staying asleep, or waking up too early.''''Restless leg syndrome:'' A condition in which a person, while resting, feels the urge to move his or her legs to stop unpleasant or unusual sensations. Walking or moving usually relieves the discomfort.' "
Movement symptoms of Lewy body dementia,"""\tSome people with LBD may not experience significant movement problems for several years. Others may have them early on. At first, signs of movement problems, such as a change in handwriting, may be very mild and thus overlooked. Parkinsonism is seen early on in Parkinson's disease dementia but can also develop later on in dementia with Lewy bodies. Specific symptoms of parkinsonism may include:"" 
		muscle rigidity or stiffness 
		shuffling gait, slow movement, or frozen stance 
		tremor or shaking, most commonly in the hands and usually at rest 
		balance problems and falls 
		stooped posture 
		loss of coordination 
		smaller handwriting than was usual for the person 
		reduced facial expression 
difficulty swallowing or a weak voice"
Other Lewy body dementia symptoms,"'\tPeople with LBD can also experience significant changes in the part of the nervous system that regulates automatic actions such as those of the heart, glands, and muscles. The person may have:' 
		frequent changes in body temperature 
		problems with blood pressure 
dizziness 
fainting 
		frequent falls 
		sensitivity to heat and cold 
		sexual dysfunction 
urinary incontinence 
constipation 
		a poor sense of smell"
How is Lewy body dementia (LBD) diagnosed?,"'\tIt\'s important to know which type of LBD a person has, both to tailor treatment to particular symptoms and to understand how the disease will likely progress. Clinicians and researchers use the ""1-year rule"" to diagnose which form of LBD a person has. If cognitive symptoms appear within a year of movement problems, the diagnosis is dementia with Lewy bodies. If cognitive problems develop more than a year after the onset of movement problems, the diagnosis is Parkinson\'s disease dementia.'""\tRegardless of the initial symptoms, over time all people with LBD will develop similar symptoms due to the presence of Lewy bodies in the brain. But there are some differences. For example, dementia with Lewy bodies may progress more quickly than Parkinson's disease dementia.""""\tDementia with Lewy bodies is often hard to diagnose because its early symptoms may resemble those of Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. As a result, it is often misdiagnosed or missed altogether. As additional symptoms appear, it is often easier to make an accurate diagnosis.""'\tThe good news is that doctors are increasingly able to diagnose LBD earlier and more accurately as researchers identify which symptoms help distinguish it from similar disorders.''\tDifficult as it is, getting an accurate diagnosis of LBD early on is important so that a person:''\tWhile a diagnosis of LBD can be distressing, some people are relieved to know the reason for their troubling symptoms. It is important to allow time to adjust to the news. Talking about a diagnosis can help shift the focus toward developing a treatment plan.''''Who Can Diagnose LBD?''\tMany physicians and other medical professionals are not familiar with LBD, so patients may consult several doctors before receiving a diagnosis. Visiting a family doctor is often the first step for people who are experiencing changes in thinking, movement, or behavior. However, neurologists - doctors who specialize in disorders of the brain and nervous system - generally have the expertise needed to diagnose LBD. Geriatric psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and geriatricians may also be skilled in diagnosing the condition.''\tIf a specialist cannot be found in your community, ask the neurology department of the nearest medical school for a referral. A hospital affiliated with a medical school may also have a dementia or movement disorders clinic that provides expert evaluation.''''Tests Used to Diagnose LBD''\tDoctors perform physical and neurological examinations and various tests to distinguish LBD from other illnesses. A thorough evaluation includes:''\tThere are no brain scans or medical tests that can definitively diagnose LBD. Currently, LBD can be diagnosed with certainty only by a brain ''autopsy'' after death.'""\tHowever, researchers are studying ways to diagnose LBD more accurately in the living brain. Certain types of neuroimaging - positron emission tomography and SPECT - have shown promise in detecting differences between dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease. These methods may help diagnose certain features of the disorder, such as dopamine deficiencies. Researchers are also investigating the use of ""'lumbar puncture'' (''spinal tap'"") to measure proteins in cerebrospinal fluid that might distinguish dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer's disease and other brain disorders.""'''Other Helpful Information''\tIt is important for the patient and a close family member or friend to tell the doctor about any symptoms involving thinking, movement, sleep, behavior, or mood. Also, discuss other health problems and provide a list of all current medications, including prescriptions, over-the-counter ''drugs'', ''vitamins'', and ''supplements''. Certain medications can worsen LBD symptoms.'""\tCaregivers may be reluctant to talk about a person's symptoms when that person is present. Ask to speak with the doctor privately if necessary. The more information a doctor has, the more accurate a diagnosis can be.""

		Medical tests: Laboratory studies can help rule out other diseases and hormonal or vitamin deficiencies that can cause dementia. 
		Brain imaging: Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can detect brain shrinkage or structural abnormalities and help rule out other possible causes of dementia or movement symptoms. A single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan can help support a diagnosis of LBD. 
		Neuropsychological tests: These tests are used to assess memory and other cognitive functions and can help identify affected brain regions."
What is the treatment and management of Lewy body dementia (LBD)?,"'\tWhile LBD currently cannot be prevented or cured, some symptoms may respond to treatment for a period of time. A comprehensive treatment plan may involve medications, physical and other types of therapy, and counseling. Changes to make the home safer, equipment to make everyday tasks easier, and social support are also very important.''\tA skilled care team often can provide suggestions to help improve quality of life for both people with LBD and their caregivers.''''Building a Care Team''\tAfter receiving a diagnosis, a person with LBD will benefit from seeing a neurologist who specializes in dementia and/or movement disorders. A good place to start is an academic medical center in your community. Ask if it has a dementia or movement disorders clinic, which is where you may find LBD specialists. If such a specialist cannot be found, a general neurologist should be part of the care team. Ask a primary care physician for a referral.'""\tA doctor can work with other types of healthcare providers. Depending on an individual's particular symptoms, other professionals may be helpful:""'\tSupport groups are another valuable resource for both people with LBD and caregivers. Sharing experiences and tips with others in the same situation can help people identify practical solutions to day-to-day challenges and get emotional and social support.'  
		Physical therapists can help with movement problems through cardiovascular, strengthening, and flexibility exercises, as well as gait training and general 
		physical fitness programs. 
		Speech therapists may help with low voice volume and voice projection, poor speaking ability, and swallowing difficulties. 
		Occupational therapists help identify ways to more easily carry out everyday activities, such as eating and bathing, to promote independence. 
		Music or expressive arts therapists may provide meaningful activities that can reduce anxiety and improve well-being. 
		Mental health counselors can help people with LBD and their families learn how to manage difficult emotions and behaviors and plan for the future."
Medications for Lewy body dementia,'\tSeveral drugs and other treatments are available to treat LBD symptoms. It is important to work with a knowledgeable health professional because certain medications can make some symptoms worse. Some symptoms can improve with nondrug treatments.' 
Medications for cognitive symptoms,"""\tSome medications used to treat Alzheimer's disease are also used to treat the cognitive symptoms of LBD. These drugs, called cholinesterase inhibitors, act on a chemical in the brain that is important for memory and thinking. They may also improve behavioral symptoms.""""\tThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves specific drugs for certain uses after rigorous testing and review. However, doctors can prescribe a drug for any use if they think it will help a patient. The FDA has approved one Alzheimer's drug, ""'rivastigmine'' (''Exelon'""®), to treat cognitive symptoms in Parkinson's disease dementia. This and other Alzheimer's drugs can have side effects such as ""'nausea'' and ''diarrhea''.' "
Medications for movement symptoms,"""\tLBD-related movement symptoms may be treated with a Parkinson's medication called ""'carbidopa''-levodopa (''Sinemet''®). This drug can help improve functioning by making it easier to walk, get out of bed, and move around. However, it cannot stop or reverse the progress of the disease.'""\tSide effects of this medication can include hallucinations and other psychiatric or behavioral problems. Because of this risk, physicians may recommend not treating mild movement symptoms with medication. If prescribed, carbidopa-levodopa usually begins at a low dose and is increased gradually. Other Parkinson's medications are less commonly used in people with LBD due to a higher frequency of side effects.""""\tA surgical procedure called deep brain stimulation, which can be very effective in treating the movement symptoms of Parkinson's disease, is not recommended for people with LBD because it can result in greater cognitive impairment.""'\tPeople with LBD may benefit from physical therapy and ''exercise''. Talk with your doctor about what physical activities are best.' "
Medications for sleep disorders,"'''Sleep problems'' may increase confusion and behavioral problems in people with LBD and add to a ''caregiver'""'s burden. To help alleviate ""'sleeplessness'' in people with LBD, a physician can order a sleep study to identify any underlying sleep disorders such as ''sleep apnea'', ''restless leg syndrome'', and REM sleep behavior disorder.'""\tREM sleep behavior disorder, a common LBD symptom, involves acting out one's dreams, leading to lost sleep and even injuries to sleep partners. ""'Clonazepam'' (''Klonopin''®), a drug used to control ''seizures'' and relieve ''panic attacks'', is often effective for the disorder at very low dosages. However, it can have side effects such as ''dizziness'', unsteadiness, and problems with thinking. ''Melatonin'', a naturally occurring hormone used to treat ''insomnia'', may also offer some benefit when taken alone or with clonazepam.''''Excessive daytime sleepiness'' is also common in LBD. If it is severe, a sleep specialist may prescribe a stimulant to help the person stay awake during the day.''\tSome people with LBD may have difficulty falling asleep. If trouble sleeping at night (''insomnia'') persists, a physician may recommend a prescription medication to promote sleep. It is important to note that treating insomnia and other sleep problems in people with LBD has not been extensively studied, and that treatments may worsen daytime sleepiness and should be used with caution.''\tCertain sleep problems can be addressed without medications. Increasing daytime exercise or activities and avoiding lengthy or frequent naps can promote ''better sleep''. Avoiding alcohol, ''caffeine'', or ''chocolate'' late in the day can help, too. Some over-the-counter medications can also affect sleep, so review all medications and ''supplements'' with a physician.' "
Medications for behavioral and mood problems,"'\tBehavioral and mood problems in people with LBD can arise from hallucinations or ''delusions''. They may also be a result of ''pain'', illness, ''stress'' or ''anxiety'', and the inability to express frustration, fear, or feeling overwhelmed. The person may resist care or lash out verbally or physically.'""\tCaregivers must try to be patient and use a variety of strategies to handle such challenging behaviors. Some behavioral problems can be managed by making changes in the person's environment and/or treating medical conditions. Other problems may require medication.""'\tThe first step is to visit a doctor to see if a medical condition unrelated to LBD is causing the problem. Injuries, ''fever'', urinary tract or pulmonary infections, pressure ulcers (bed sores), and ''constipation'' can cause behavioral problems to suddenly grow worse. Increased confusion can also occur.''\tCertain medications used to treat LBD symptoms or other diseases may also cause behavioral problems. For example, some over-the-counter ''sleep aids'', strong ''pain'' medications, bladder control medications, and drugs used to treat LBD-related movement symptoms can cause confusion, agitation, hallucinations, and delusions. Similarly, some anti-anxiety medicines can actually increase anxiety in people with LBD. Review your medications with your doctor to determine if any changes are needed.'""\tNot all behavior problems are caused by illness or medication. A person's surroundings - including levels of stimulation or ""'stress'', lighting, daily routines, and relationships - can lead to behavior issues. Caregivers can alter the home environment to try to minimize anxiety and stress for the person with LBD. In general, people with LBD benefit from having simple tasks, consistent schedules, regular exercise, and adequate sleep. Large crowds or overly stimulating environments can increase confusion and anxiety.'""\tHallucinations and delusions are among the biggest challenges for LBD caregivers. The person with LBD may not understand or accept that the hallucinations are not real and become agitated or anxious. Caregivers can help by responding to the fears expressed instead of arguing or responding factually to comments that may not be true. By tuning in to the person's emotions, caregivers can offer empathy and concern, maintain the person's dignity, and limit further tension.""'\tCholinesterase inhibitors may reduce hallucinations and other psychiatric symptoms of LBD. These medications may have side effects, such as ''nausea'', and are not always effective. However, they can be a good first choice to treat behavioral symptoms. Cholinesterase inhibitors do not affect behavior immediately, so they should be considered part of a long-term strategy.''''Antidepressants'' can be used to treat depression and anxiety, which are common in LBD. Two types of antidepressants, called selective ''serotonin'' reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, are often well tolerated by people with LBD.''\tIn some cases, ''antipsychotic'' medications are necessary to treat LBD-related behavioral symptoms to improve both the quality of life and safety of the person with LBD and his or her caregiver. But these types of medications must be used with caution because they can cause severe side effects and can worsen movement symptoms. Consult a doctor before using these types of medications.''\tIf antipsychotics are prescribed, it is very important to use the newer kind, called atypical antipsychotics. These medications should be used at the lowest dose possible and for the shortest time possible to control symptoms. Many LBD experts prefer ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''®) or ''clozapine'' (''Clozaril''®) to control difficult behavioral symptoms.''\tOlder drugs called typical (or traditional) antipsychotics, such as ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol''®), generally should not be prescribed for people with LBD. They can cause dangerous side effects.' "
Other treatment considerations,"'\tLBD affects the part of the nervous system that regulates automatic actions like blood pressure and ''digestion''. One common symptom is ''orthostatic hypotension'', ''low blood pressure'' that can cause dizziness and ''fainting''. Simple measures such as leg elevation, elastic stockings, and, when recommended by a doctor, increasing salt and fluid intake can help. If these measures are not enough, a doctor may prescribe medication.''\tUrinary ''incontinence'' (inability to control urinary movements) should be treated cautiously because certain medications may worsen cognition. Consider seeing a urologist. Constipation can usually be treated by exercise and changes in ''diet'', though laxatives and stool softeners may be necessary.''\tPeople with LBD are often sensitive to prescription and over-the-counter medications for other medical conditions. Talk with your doctor about any side effects seen in a person with LBD.'""\tIf surgery is planned and the person with LBD is told to stop taking all medications beforehand, ask the doctor to consult the person's neurologist in developing a plan for careful withdrawal. In addition, be sure to talk with the anesthesiologist in advance to discuss medication sensitivities and risks unique to LBD. People with LBD who receive certain anesthetics often become confused or delirious and may have a sudden, significant decline in functional abilities, which may become permanent.""'\tDepending on the procedure, possible alternatives to general anesthesia include a spinal or regional block. These methods are less likely to result in confusion after surgery.' "
What is dengue fever? What causes dengue fever?,"'Dengue fever is a disease caused by a family of viruses transmitted by infected mosquitoes. It is an acute illness of sudden onset that usually follows a benign course with symptoms such as ''headache'', fever, exhaustion, severe muscle and ''joint pain'', ''swollen lymph nodes'' (''lymphadenopathy''), and rash. The presence of fever, ''itchy'' rash, and ''headache'' (the ""dengue triad"") is characteristic of dengue. Other signs of dengue fever include ''bleeding gums'', severe ''pain'' behind the eyes (retro-orbital), and red palms and soles.''Dengue (pronounced DENG-gay) can affect anyone but tends to be more severe in people with compromised immune systems. Because one of five serotypes of the dengue virus causes dengue fever, it is possible to get dengue fever multiple times. However, an attack of dengue produces immunity for a lifetime to that particular viral dengue serotype to which the patient was exposed.''Dengue goes by other names, including ""breakbone fever"" or ""dandy fever."" Victims of dengue often have contortions due to the intense pain in the joints, muscles, and bones, hence the name breakbone fever. Slaves in the West Indies who contracted dengue were said to have dandy fever because of their postures and gait.''Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a more severe form of the viral illness. Symptoms include headache, fever, rash, and evidence of bleeding (hemorrhage) in the body. ''Petechiae'' (small red spots or purple splotches or ''blisters'' under the skin), bleeding in the nose or gums, ''black stools'', or ''easy bruising'' are all possible signs of hemorrhage. This form of dengue fever can be life threatening and can progress to the most severe form of the illness, dengue shock syndrome.'  "
What geographic areas are at high risk for contracting dengue fever?,"'According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), dengue virus is prevalent throughout the tropics and subtropics (subtropical areas). Outbreaks have occurred recently in the Caribbean, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Cuba, and Central America. Cases have also been imported via tourists returning from areas with widespread dengue, including Tahiti, Singapore, the South Pacific, including the Philippines, Southeast Asia, the West Indies, India, and the Middle East (similar in distribution to the areas of the world that harbor ''malaria'' and ''yellow fever''). Dengue is now the leading cause of acute febrile illness in U.S. ''travelers'' returning from the Caribbean, South America, and Asia.' From January to July 2017, Sri Lanka reported 80,732 cases of dengue fever, with 215 deaths. New Delhi, India, reported an outbreak of dengue fever, with 1,872 testing positive for the illness in September 2015. In American Samoa, there were 370 cases of dengue reported from May 2015 to Sept. 2, 2015, and 133 were hospitalized. Thailand reported the worst dengue virus outbreak in 20 years, with 126 deaths and 135,344 people infected with the virus, in October 2013. In 2011, Bolivia, Brazil, Columbia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela reported a large number of dengue cases. Paraguay reported a dengue fever outbreak in 2011, the worst since 2007. Hospitals were overcrowded, and patients had elective surgeries canceled due to the outbreak."
How do people contract dengue fever? Is dengue fever contagious?,"'The vector-borne dengue virus infection spreads via the bite of a striped ''Aedes aegypti'' and ''Aedes albopictus'' mosquito that has previously bitten an infected person. The mosquito flourishes during rainy seasons but can breed in water-filled flowerpots, ''plastic'' ''bags'', and cans year-round. One mosquito bite can cause the disease.''The virus is not ''contagious'' and cannot spread directly from person to person. It is mosquito-borne, so there must be a person-to-mosquito-to-another-person pathway. A mosquito bites a dengue-infected person and becomes infected with dengue. That mosquito then bites another person and passes the dengue virus infection to that person. The full life cycle of the virus involves the ''Aedes'' mosquito as the vector (transmitter) and the human as the source of infection.''Avoiding mosquitos is important to avoid contracting dengue fever. In dengue-endemic tropical and sub-tropical areas, you should wear light-colored long-sleeved shirts and long pants or trousers, use insect repellant, stay or ''sleep'' indoors in air conditioning when possible and use mosquito netting over the bed if available.''Dengue is not a tick-borne illness. Only the bite of an infected mosquito can transmit dengue.' "
What is the incubation period for dengue fever?,"'After being bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus, the incubation period for dengue fever ranges from 3 to 15 (usually 5 to 8) days before the signs and symptoms of dengue appear in stages.' "
What are dengue fever symptoms and signs?,"'Dengue fever starts with non-specific ''flu-like symptoms'' of ''chills'', headache, pain in the back of the eyes that may worsen upon moving the eyes, ''appetite loss'', feeling unwell (malaise), and low backache. Painful aching in the legs and joints occurs during the first hours of illness. The temperature rises quickly as high as 104 F (40 C), with relatively low ''heart'' rate (bradycardia) and ''low blood pressure'' (''hypotension''). The eyes redden. A flushing or pale pink rash comes over the face and then disappears. The ''lymph nodes'' in the neck and groin are often swollen.''High fever and other signs of dengue last for 2 to 4 days, followed by a rapid drop in body temperature (defervescence) with profuse ''sweating''. This precedes a period with normal temperature and a sense of well-being that lasts about a day. A second rapid rise in temperature follows. A characteristic ''itchy'' rash (small red spots, called petechiae) appears along with the fever and spreads from the extremities to cover the entire body except the face. The palms and soles may be bright red and swollen.'  "
What tests do health care providers use to diagnose dengue fever?,"'Medical professionals usually make a diagnosis of dengue fever infection when a patient exhibits the typical clinical symptoms and signs of headache, high fever, ''eye pain'', severe muscle aches, and petechial rash and has a history of being in an area where dengue fever is endemic. Dengue fever can be difficult to diagnose because its symptoms overlap with those of many other viral illnesses and tropical diseases, such as ''West Nile virus'' and chikungunya fever.''Health care professionals may use a blood test called the DENV Detect IgM Capture ''ELISA'' to diagnose people with dengue fever. The FDA notes that the test may also give a positive result when a person has a closely related virus, such West Nile disease.' "
What is the treatment for dengue fever?,"'Because a virus causes dengue fever, there are no specific antibiotics to treat it. Antiviral medications are also not indicated for dengue fever. For typical dengue, the treatment is concerned with relief of the symptoms and signs. Home remedies such as rest and fluid intake (oral rehydration) are important. Only take pain relievers such as ''aspirin'' and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'"") under a doctor's supervision because of the possibility of worsening bleeding complications. ""'Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') and ''codeine'' may be given for severe headache and for joint and muscle pain (''myalgia'').''Patients hospitalized for dengue may receive IV fluids.''In several clinical studies, researchers proved that ''Carica papaya'' leaf extract (papaya leaf) is an effective treatment for dengue fever.'  "
What types of doctors treat dengue fever?,"'A primary care provider (PCP), such as your family practitioner or internist, can treat your dengue fever symptoms. A pediatrician can treat your child. If symptoms are severe, you may see an ''emergency medicine'' doctor in a hospital emergency department.''If your doctor is not familiar with treating dengue fever or your symptoms are severe, you may see an infectious disease specialist or a ''travel medicine'' physician.' "
How long does dengue fever last?,"'The acute phase of dengue with fever and muscle pain (myalgia) lasts about one to two weeks. A feeling of ''weakness'' (asthenia) and ''fatigue'' accompany convalescence, and full recovery often takes several weeks.' "
What is the prognosis for typical dengue fever?,"'The prognosis for dengue is usually good. The worst symptoms of the illness typically last 1 to 2 weeks, and most patients will fully recover within several additional weeks.''Typical dengue infection is fatal in less than 1% of cases; however, the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever is fatal in 2.5% of cases. If dengue hemorrhagic fever is not treated, mortality (death) rates can be as high as 20%-50%.' "
What is dengue hemorrhagic fever?,"'Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF or dengue haemorrhagic fever) is a specific syndrome that tends to affect children under 10 years of age. This complication of severe dengue fever causes ''abdominal pain'', hemorrhage (bleeding), and circulatory collapse (shock). DHF is also called Philippine, Thai, or Southeast Asian hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome.''DHF starts abruptly with continuous high ''fever and headache''. There are respiratory and intestinal symptoms with ''sore throat'', ''cough'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''abdominal pain''. Shock occurs 2 to 6 days after the start of symptoms with sudden collapse, cool, clammy extremities (the trunk is often warm), weak pulse, and blueness around the mouth (circumoral ''cyanosis'').''In DHF, there is bleeding with ''easy bruising'', red or purple blood spots in the skin (petechiae), spitting up blood (hematemesis), ''blood in the stool'' (melena), bleeding gums, and ''nosebleeds'' (epistaxis). ''Pneumonia'' is common, and inflammation of the heart (''myocarditis'') may be present.''People must closely monitor patients with DHF for the first few days since shock may occur or recur precipitously (dengue shock syndrome). Medical professionals will give cyanotic (having a bluish coloration to the skin and ''mucus'' membranes) patients oxygen. Vascular collapse (shock) requires immediate fluid replacement. Blood transfusions can control bleeding.''The mortality (death) rate with DHF is significant. With proper treatment, the World Health Organization estimates a 2.5% mortality rate. However, without proper treatment, the mortality rate rises to 20%. Most deaths occur in children. Infants under 1 year of age are especially at risk of dying from DHF.' "
Is it possible to prevent dengue fever with a vaccine?,"""In April 2016, the WHO approved Sanofi Pasteur's Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV), a live recombinant tetravalent vaccine for dengue fever. Dengvaxia can be administered as a three-dose series in people 9-45 years of age who live in areas where dengue is endemic.""'In ''clinical trials'' in Latin America and Asia involving more than 40,000 children and adolescents, Dengvaxia protected 66% of people aged 9 and older against dengue. Dengvaxia was very effective at protecting against severe dengue, which can be fatal, preventing 93% of severe cases, and reducing hospitalizations due to dengue by 80%.''Health officials initially approved Dengvaxia in 2015 for use only in Mexico, the Philippines, Brazil, and El Salvador. In May 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Dengvaxia for the prevention of dengue caused by all dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 -- sometimes also referred to as DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4) in people ages 9 through 16 who have laboratory-confirmed previous dengue infection and who live in endemic areas. In the U.S., dengue is endemic in the territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.''Several other ''vaccines'' for dengue are undergoing clinical trials, but none have yet been approved for use.'

What is a tooth filling?,"'To treat a ''cavity'' your dentist will remove the decayed portion of the tooth and then ""fill"" the area on the tooth where the decayed material once lived.''Fillings are also used to repair cracked or broken ''teeth'' and ''teeth'' that have been worn down from misuse (such as from nail-biting or tooth grinding).' "
What steps are involved in filling a tooth?,"'First, the dentist will numb the area around the tooth with a local anesthetic. Next, a drill, air ''abrasion'"" instrument or laser will be used to remove the decayed area. The choice of instrument depends on the individual dentist's comfort level, training, and investment in the particular piece of equipment as well as location and extent of the decay.""'Next, your dentist will probe or test the area during the decay removal process to determine if all the decay has been removed. Once the decay has been removed, your dentist will prepare the space for the filling by cleaning the ''cavity'' of bacteria and debris. If the decay is near the root, your dentist may first put in a liner made of glass ionomer, composite resin, or other material to protect the nerve. Generally, after the filling is in, your dentist will finish and polish it.''Several additional steps are required for tooth-colored fillings and are as follows. After your dentist has removed the decay and cleaned the area, the tooth-colored material is applied in layers. Next, a special light that ""cures"" or hardens each layer is applied. When the multilayering process is completed, your dentist will shape the composite material to the desired result, trim off any excess material and polish the final restoration.' "
What types of filling materials are available?,"'Today, several dental filling materials are available. Teeth can be filled with gold; porcelain; silver amalgam (which consists of mercury mixed with silver, tin, zinc, and copper); or tooth-colored, ''plastic'"" and glass materials called composite resin fillings. The location and extent of the decay, cost of filling material, patients' insurance coverage and your dentist's recommendation assist in determining the type of filling that will best address your needs.""'In addition to tooth-colored, composite resin fillings, two other tooth-colored fillings exist -- ceramics and glass ionomer.'  Durability -- lasts at least 10 to 15 years, usually longer; doesn't corrode Strength -- can withstand chewing forces Aesthetics -- some patients find gold more pleasing to the eye than silver, amalgam fillings Expense -- more than other materials; up to 10 times higher than cost of amalgam filings Additional office visits -- requires at least two office visits to place Galvanic shock -- a gold filling placed immediately next to a silver, amalgam filling can cause a sharp pain (galvanic shock) to occur. The interaction between the metals and saliva causes an electric current to occur -- it's a rare occurrence, however Aesthetics -- most patients don't find any ""colored"" fillings to be an ""eye-pleasing"" advantage Durability -- lasts at least 10 to 15 years and usually outlasts composite fillings Strength -- can withstand chewing forces Expense -- is less expensive than composite fillings Poor aesthetics -- fillings don't match the color of your natural teeth Destruction of more tooth structure -- healthy parts of the tooth must often be removed to make a space large enough to hold the amalgam filling Discoloration -- amalgam fillings can create a grayish hue to the surrounding tooth structure Cracks and fractures -- although all teeth expand and contract in the presence of hot and cold liquids, which ultimately can cause the tooth to crack or fracture, amalgam material -- in comparison with other filling materials -- may experience a wider degree of expansion and contraction and lead to a higher incidence of cracks and fractures Allergic reactions -- a small percentage of people, approximately 1%, are allergic to the mercury present in amalgam restorations Aesthetics -- the shade/color of the composites can be closely matched to the color of existing teeth; is particularly well suited for use in front teeth or visible parts of teeth Bonding to tooth structure -- composite fillings actually chemically bond to tooth structure, providing further support to the tooth Versatility in uses -- in addition to use as a filling material for decay, composite fillings can also be used to repair chipped, broken or worn teeth Tooth-sparing preparation -- sometimes less tooth structure needs to be removed compared with amalgams when removing decay and preparing for the filling Lack of durability -- composite fillings wear out sooner than amalgams (lasting at least 5 years compared with at least 10 to 15 for amalgams); in addition, they may not last as long as amalgams under the pressure of chewing and particularly if used as the filling material for large cavities Increased chair time -- because of the process to apply the composite material, these fillings can take up to 20 minutes longer than amalgams to place Additional visits -- if composites are used for inlays or onlays, more than one office visit may be required Chipping -- depending on location, composite materials can chip off the tooth Expense -- composite fillings can cost up to twice the cost of amalgams Ceramics, which are made most often of porcelain, are more resistant to staining than composite resin material but are also more abrasive. This material generally lasts more than 15 years and can cost as much as gold. Glass ionomer is made of acrylic and a specific type of glass material. This material is most commonly used for fillings below the gum line and for fillings in young children (drilling is still required). Glass ionomers release fluoride, which can help protect the tooth from further decay. However, this material is weaker than composite resin and is more susceptible to wear and prone to fracture. Glass ionomer generally lasts 5 years or less with costs comparable to composite resin."
Does dental insurance cover the cost of composites?,"'Most dental insurance plans cover the cost of the composites up to the price of the silver filling, then the patient must pay the difference.' "
What are indirect fillings?,"'Indirect fillings are similar to composite or tooth-colored fillings except that they are made in a dental laboratory and require two visits before being placed. Indirect fillings are considered when not enough tooth structure remains to support a filling but the tooth is not so severely damaged that it needs a ''crown''.''During the first visit, decay or an old filling is removed. An impression is taken to record the shape of the tooth being repaired and the teeth around it. The impression is sent to a dental laboratory that will make the indirect filling. A temporary filling (described below) is placed to protect the tooth while your restoration is being made. During the second visit, the temporary filling is removed, and the dentist will check the fit of the indirect restoration. Provided the fit is acceptable, it will be permanently cemented into place.''There are two types of indirect fillings -- inlays and onlays.''Inlays and onlays are more durable and last much longer than traditional fillings -- up to 30 years. They can be made of tooth-colored composite resin, porcelain or gold. Inlays and onlays weaken the tooth structure, but do so to a much lower extent than traditional fillings.''Another type of inlay and onlay -- direct inlays and onlays -- follow the same processes and procedures as the indirect; the difference is that direct inlays and onlays are made in the dental office and can be placed in one visit. The type of inlay or onlay used depends on how much sound tooth structure remains and consideration of any cosmetic concerns.' Inlays are similar to fillings but the entire work lies within the cusps (bumps) on the chewing surface of the tooth. Onlays are more extensive than inlays, covering one or more cusps. Onlays are sometimes called partial crowns."
What is a temporary filling and why would I need one?,"'Temporary fillings are used under the following circumstances:'""Temporary fillings are just that; they are not meant to last. They usually fall out, fracture, or wear out within 1 month. Be sure to contact your dentist to have your temporary filling replaced with a permanent one. If you don't, your tooth could become infected or you could have other complications."" For fillings that require more than one appointment -- for example, before placement of gold fillings and for certain filling procedures (called indirect fillings) that use composite materials Following a root canal To allow a tooth's nerve to ""settle down"" if the pulp became irritated If emergency dental treatment is needed (such as to address a toothache)"
Are amalgam-type fillings safe?,"'Over the past several years, concerns have been raised about silver-colored fillings, otherwise called amalgams. Because amalgams contain the toxic substance mercury, some people think that amalgams are responsible for causing a number of diseases, including ''autism'', '""Alzheimer's""' disease, and ''multiple sclerosis''.''The American Dental Association (ADA), the FDA, and numerous public health agencies say amalgams are safe, and that any link between mercury-based fillings and disease is unfounded. The causes of ''autism'', '""Alzheimer's""' disease, and ''multiple sclerosis'' remain unknown. Additionally, there is no solid, scientific evidence to back up the claim that if a person has amalgam fillings removed, he or she will be cured of these or any other diseases.''In March of 2002, the FDA reconfirmed the safety of amalgams. Although amalgams do contain mercury, when they are mixed with other metals, such as silver, copper, tin, and zinc, they form a stable alloy that dentists have used for more than 100 years to fill and preserve hundreds of millions of decayed teeth. The National Institutes of Health published several large-scale studies\xa0to answer many of the questions raised about silver-colored amalgams. Results of these studies were released in 2006.''In addition, there has been concern over the release of a small amount of mercury vapor from these fillings, but according to the ADA, there is no scientific evidence that this small amount results in adverse health effects.' "
How should I care for my teeth with fillings?,"'To maintain your fillings, you should follow good oral hygiene practices -- visiting your dentist regularly for cleanings, brushing with a fluoride-containing ''toothpaste'', and flossing at least once daily. If your dentist suspects that a filling might be cracked or is ""leaking"" (when the sides of the filling don\'t fit tightly against the tooth, this allows debris and saliva to seep down between the filling and the tooth, which can lead to decay), he or she will take ''X-rays'' to assess the situation. If your tooth is extremely sensitive, if you feel a sharp edge, if you notice a crack in the filling, or if a piece of the filling is missing, call your dentist for an appointment.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Edited by Charlotte E.

Introduction,"'Dental bonding'' is a procedure in which a tooth-colored resin material (a durable ''plastic'' material) is applied and hardened with a special light, which ultimately ""bonds"" the material to the tooth to restore or improve an individual\'s smile.' "
For What Conditions Is Dental Bonding Considered?,'Dental bonding is an option that can be considered:' to repair decayed teeth (composite resins are used to fill cavities)   to close spaces between teeth to make teeth look longer to change the shape of teeth as a cosmetic alternative to amalgam fillings to protect a portion of the tooth's root that has been exposed when gums recede
What's the Procedure for Having a Tooth Bonded?,"'' Preparation. Little advance preparation is needed for dental bonding. Anesthesia is often not necessary unless the bonding is being used to fill a decayed tooth. Your dentist will use a shade guide to select a composite resin color that will closely match the color of your tooth.
   The bonding process. Next, the surface of the tooth will be roughened and a conditioning liquid applied. These procedures help the bonding material adhere to the tooth. The tooth-colored, puttylike resin is then applied, molded and smoothed to the desired shape. An ultraviolet light or laser is then used to harden the material. After the material is hardened, your dentist will further trim and shape it, and polish it to match the sheen of the rest of the tooth surface.
   Time-to-completion. The procedure takes about 30 to 60 minutes per tooth to complete."
What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Dental Bonding?,"'''Because of some of the limitations of bonding, some dentists view bonding as best suited for small cosmetic changes, for temporary correction of cosmetic defects, and for correction of teeth in areas of very low bite pressure (for example, front teeth). Consult with your dentist about the best cosmetic approach for your particular problem.' Advantages: Bonding is among the easiest and least expensive of cosmetic dental procedures. Unlike  veneers  and  crowns , which are customized tooth coverings that must be manufactured in a laboratory, bonding usually can be done in one office visit unless several teeth are involved. Another advantage, compared with veneers and crowns, is that the least amount of tooth enamel is removed. Also, unless dental bonding is being performed to fill a  cavity , anesthesia is usually not required.
 Disadvantages: Although the material used in dental bonding is somewhat stain resistant, it does not resist stains as well as crowns. Another disadvantage is that the bonding materials do not last as long nor are as strong as other restorative procedures, such as crowns, veneers, or  fillings . Additionally, bonding materials can chip and break off the tooth. 
Because of some of the limitations of bonding, some dentists view bonding as best suited for small cosmetic changes, for temporary correction of cosmetic defects, and for correction of teeth in areas of very low bite pressure (for example, front teeth). Consult with your dentist about the best cosmetic approach for your particular problem."
Do Bonded Teeth Require any Special Care?,"'No. Simply follow good oral hygiene practices. Brush your teeth at least twice a day, floss at least once a day and see your dentist for regular professional check-ups and cleanings.''Because bonding material can chip, it is important to avoid such habits as biting fingernails; chewing on pens, ice or other hard food objects; or using your bonded teeth as an opener. If you do notice any sharp edges on a bonded tooth or if your tooth feels odd when you bite down, call your dentist.' "
How Long Does Bonding Material Last?,"'The lifespan of bonding materials depends on how much bonding was done and your oral habits. Typically, however, bonding material lasts from 3 years up to about 10 years before needing to be touched up or replaced.' "
How Much Does Dental Bonding Cost?,"'Costs may vary depending on where you live. Generally, bonding can range in cost from $100 to $400 per tooth. Check with your dental insurance company to find out if the cost of crowns might be fully or partially covered.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Edited by  Michael W. Smith, MD, April 2003, WebMD. ''Portions of this page ©  ''The Cleveland Clinic''  2000-2003' "
What are dental braces?,"'Dental  ''braces'' are devices that are placed directly on ''teeth'' in order to move them. For most of us, braces are the most common method for achieving optimally aligned ''teeth''. Aside from straightening teeth, braces are used to improve the relationship of how our teeth come together between the upper and lower jaws. Braces for tooth movement fall under the dental specialty of “''orthodontics''” which is the study and treatment of improper bites (malocclusion). Orthodontic treatment with braces is used for cosmetic as well as functional improvement in respect to teeth position.'""The  “braces” are the actual devices that are attached to teeth. They usually consist of “brackets” that are bonded to the teeth and a metal wire that is inserted into the brackets. The metal wires are “tightened” and work together with the brackets to move teeth into the desired positions. There are other components that are also used in conjunction with braces to move teeth, jaw, and bone such as headgear and expansion devices. While orthodontics work on teeth movement, it sometimes involves working with one's facial bone growth to achieve favorable jaw dimensions and relationship."" "
Who is a good candidate for braces?,"""Braces can be for any age group, but there are optimal times to begin treatment. These days, it is recommended that children have an orthodontic evaluation at the age of 7 to determine if early intervention is needed or advantageous. If recommended, early intervention optimizes results by taking advantage of a child's skeletal bone growth and may require two-phase orthodontic treatment. The first phase (“phase-one”) is considered interceptive orthodontic treatment as it addresses overcrowding of teeth or bite problems at an early age. As an example of interceptive treatment, a narrow upper jaw that has crowded teeth and does not fit correctly with the lower jaw can be widened with an expansion device called a “palatal expander.” This lets the upper jaw line up better with the lower jaw and allows room for upper teeth to fit in alignment. Widening the palate can only occur during a small window of time in a growing child before the bone becomes too developed to change. During “phase-one,” braces may or may not be used depending on the specific situation. After “phase-one,” there is a resting period to allow most or all of the permanent teeth to come in.""'Around the age of 12 or 13, “phase-two” treatment may begin. During this phase, the alignment of all the permanent teeth is addressed using full braces.''If the window of time for two-phase orthodontic treatment has already passed, results can still be achieved with only one phase of treatment. However, if there is significant crowding of teeth, dental extractions may be required to create room for teeth to move into alignment. Another method for creating room for teeth movement is called “interproximal reduction” (IPR). IPR involves minimal removal of tooth structure on the sides of the teeth to create more room. This method is limited to mild teeth crowding.''Essentially, anyone who desires to have straighter teeth or improve their bite may be a good candidate for braces. A thorough evaluation with a qualified clinician is very important in determining whether one is a good candidate for braces.' "
What are the different types of braces?,"'There are various types of braces available today. Choosing the right type depends on various considerations such as aesthetics, cost, and ''allergy'' concerns.''Metal wired braces:'' These are the most common and traditional type of braces. They are typically made out of stainless steel. Metal brackets are fixed (bonded) onto the teeth and secure a wire with elastic ties made out of rubber. As an alternative to using elastic ties, “self-ligating” brackets are used to clip onto the wire.''Ceramic wired braces:'' Also called “clear braces,” these provide a cosmetic alternative to the metal wired braces. The brackets are ceramic to match the shade of teeth and clear elastic ties are used. Self-ligating ceramic brackets are also available. The downside to ceramic braces is that they are more prone to breakage compared to the metal braces.''Lingual braces:'' These are braces that are placed on the lingual surface (backside) of the teeth and are not easily visible. This is mainly for cosmetic purposes and usually lengthens the time for treatment.''Other metal braces:'' Gold-plated stainless steel or titanium brackets are usually used for those with nickel ''allergies''.''Clear aligners:'' These braces are made of a clear ''plastic''  that is custom-made without the use of brackets or wires on the teeth. These are also known as “clear braces” and present a very comfortable option for treatment. However, there are limitations to this method. Clear aligners can only tilt and rotate teeth in their position. Conversely, the use of brackets with traditional braces enables the whole bodily movement of a tooth (and its root) into the desired position.' "
How do braces work?,"'Braces work by a slow and controlled process using force and constant pressure. For traditional braces, the wire that is attached to the brackets works to put pressure on the teeth to move to a specified direction.''Teeth move through a biomechanical process called “bone remodeling.” When braces put pressure on a tooth, the “periodontal membrane” and bone surrounding this tooth are affected. The periodontal membrane completely surrounds a tooth in its socket and it essentially helps anchor the tooth to bone. With pressure from braces, the periodontal membrane of a tooth is stretched on one side and compressed on the other side. This effectively loosens the tooth out of its socket. The compressed side (the direction of pressure) is where bone is broken down to accommodate the new position of the tooth while the stretched side is where new bone is made. This process needs to be done very slowly and explains why wearing braces can take some time to achieve the desired results.' "
What is the procedure for getting braces?,"'The initial step for obtaining braces involves a thorough evaluation and record taking with an experienced clinician. Dental impressions (molds) are taken to make models for study and ''X-rays'' are taken to look at teeth positions. Measurements are taken in the mouth as well. Once thoroughly evaluated, a treatment plan is created. This plan will specify what has been diagnosed for correction, treatment recommendations, and an estimated time for how long treatment will take. A discussion between the clinician and patient takes place where all the risks, benefits, and alternatives of treatment are reviewed.''If necessary, all dental extractions are performed prior to the placement of braces or other orthodontic appliances. For the two-phase process, appliances such as palatal expanders and headgear are used during the “phase-one” treatment to correct any developing skeletal growth problem.''For placement of traditional braces, brackets are bonded with special dental cement to all the teeth in the arch. For some clinicians, elastic spacers are placed between the molars for 1 to 2 weeks prior to placement of the brackets to make room for metal bands with attached brackets. These metal bands are typically placed around the last molars and are able to withstand the forces of chewing better than bonded brackets in the back teeth.'""After the brackets and/or metal bands are in place, a metal wire (or “archwire”) is placed in the brackets and secured with elastic rubber bands (or clipped into place with self-ligating brackets). Of note, elastic rubber bands come in a variety of colors and can be an appealing component of a child's orthodontic experience.""'For clear aligner braces, accurate dental impressions (molds) are taken in order to have a set of aligners made. The aligners are a sequence of clear trays that fit over the teeth to achieve movement. Each tray is worn for a period of time before progressing to the next tray.' "
Do braces hurt?,"'Placement of traditional braces is usually ''pain'' free, but the teeth and jaws will feel sore afterwards. This is due to the slow movement of teeth that is taking place. This initial soreness usually lasts for about a week and then for a couple of days after each adjustment of the archwire during treatment. This discomfort also applies to clear aligners as tooth movement is taking place. During this time, it helps to have a soft food ''diet'' and use ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) ''pain'' medications such as  ''ibuprofen'' or ''acetaminophen'' when appropriate. Initially, orthodontic wax can be used to cover rough areas that rub against the cheeks until the mouth becomes more accustomed to the brackets and wires.'  "
How much do braces cost? Does insurance cover orthodontic treatment?,"'Cost of treatment is very individual as every mouth is different. Cost will depend on treatment time, steps involved and will vary by location. An estimated cost range for “phase-one” treatment is $2,000 to $4,000. For “phase-two” treatment, an estimated cost range is $2,000 to $7,000. Clear aligner treatment costs more by about 20 to 50 percent.''Orthodontic treatment can be a covered benefit through dental insurance. Limitations may exist depending on the dental insurance plan.'  "
What is it like to have braces?,"'There is no doubt that braces can initially be uncomfortable and be a cosmetic concern. Aside from the teeth soreness, the inconveniences of wearing braces include: constantly getting food stuck when eating, having to spend more time cleaning the teeth, and having to be cautious of the types of food that can be eaten. However, more often than not, individuals are happy to have gone through the process of orthodontic treatment to improve their smile or correct their bite. The results of treatment can be very rewarding.' "
What happens after braces come off?,"'Once braces come off, more records (molds and X-rays) are taken to evaluate the end result. Additionally, plans for a dental retainer are made to keep the newly-positioned teeth in place. Without a retainer, the teeth can shift. There are usually two types of retainers -- removable or fixed. A removable retainer is made of acrylic and metal wires or a clear rigid plastic tray and can be easily removed for ease of brushing and flossing the teeth. A fixed retainer is usually bonded to the back (""lingual"") side of the teeth. The advantages of this type of retainer are that it cannot be lost and it is more effective in retaining teeth position. Typically, retainers need to be worn full-time after braces are removed for a period of time and then, for removable retainers, followed by part-time wear at night indefinitely. For adults completing orthodontic treatment, retainers usually need to be worn for a lifetime. The dentist or orthodontist will recommend how long to wear the retainers as each case is different.' "
What Are the Benefits of Dental Bridges?,'Bridges:' Restore your smile Restore your ability to properly chew and speak Maintain the shape of your face Distribute the forces in your bite properly by replacing missing teeth Prevent remaining teeth from drifting out of position
What Types of Dental Bridges Are Available?,"'There are three main types of bridges:' Traditional bridges involve creating a crown for the tooth or implant on either side of the missing tooth, with a pontic in between. Traditional bridges are the most common type of bridge and are made of either porcelain fused to metal or ceramics. Cantilever bridges are used when there are adjacent teeth on only one side of the missing tooth or teeth. 
Cantilever bridges are usually used to replace only one tooth. Maryland bonded bridges (also called a resin-bonded bridge or a Maryland bridge) are made of plastic teeth and gums supported by a metal framework. Metal wings on each side of the bridge are bonded to your existing teeth."
What Is the Process for Obtaining a Dental Bridge?,"'During the first visit, the abutment teeth are prepared for the crown. Preparation involves recontouring these teeth by removing a portion of enamel to allow room for a crown to be placed over them. Next, impressions of your teeth are made, which serve as a model from which the bridge, pontic, and crowns will be made by a dental laboratory. Your dentist will make a temporary bridge for you to wear to protect the exposed teeth and gums while your bridge is being made.'""During the second visit, your temporary bridge will be removed and the new permanent bridge will be checked and adjusted, as necessary, to achieve a proper fit. Multiple visits may be required to check the fit of the metal framework and bite. This is dependent on each individual's case. If the ""'dental bridge'' is a fixed (permanent) bridge, your dentist may temporarily cement it in place for a couple of weeks to make sure it is fitting properly. After a couple weeks, the bridge is permanently cemented into place.'  "
How Much Do Dental Bridges Cost?,'The cost of dental bridges varies depending on the type of bridge selected and the area of the country in which the procedure is performed. Dental insurance will typically pay a percentage of the fee depending on the individual dental plan.' 
How Long Do Dental Bridges Last?,"'Dental bridges can last 5 to 15 years and even longer. With good oral hygiene and regular prophylaxis, it is not unusual for the life span of a fixed bridge to be over 10 years.' "
Will It Be Difficult to Eat with a Dental Bridge?,"'Replacing missing teeth should actually make eating easier. Until you become accustomed to the bridge, eat soft foods that have been cut into small pieces.' "
Will the Dental Bridge Change How I Speak?,'It can be difficult to speak clearly when teeth are missing in the front or anterior areas. Wearing a dental bridge with the anterior teeth in their proper relationship will help you speak properly.' 
How Do I Care for My Bridges?,"'It is important to keep your remaining teeth healthy and strong as the success of the bridge (depending on the type selected) depends on the solid foundation offered by the surrounding teeth. Brushing twice a day and flossing daily helps prevent ''tooth decay'' and ''gum disease'' that can lead to tooth loss. Your dentist or dental hygienist can demonstrate how to properly brush and floss your teeth. Keeping a regular cleaning schedule will help diagnose problems at an early stage when treatment has a better prognosis. Selecting a balanced ''diet'' for proper ''nutrition'' is also important.''Reviewed by the doctors at the Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Reviewed by Jay H.

How Should I Care for My Teeth and Gums?,'There are four basic steps to caring for teeth and gums:' Brushing Flossing Eating right Visiting the dentist
Tips for Brushing,"'Brush at least twice a day. If you can, brush after every meal. Brushingremoves plaque, a film of bacteria that clings to teeth. When bacteria in plaquecome into contact with food, they produce acids. These acids lead to ''cavities''.To brush:' Place a pea-sized dab of fluoride toothpaste on the head of the toothbrush.
(Use a soft toothbrush.) Place the toothbrush against the teeth at a 45-degree angle to the gum
line. Move the brush across the teeth using a small circular motion. Continue
with this motion cleaning one tooth at a time. Keep the tips of the bristles
against the gum line. Avoid pressing so hard that the bristles lie flat against
the teeth. (Only the tips of the toothbrush clean the teeth.) Let the bristles
reach into spaces between teeth. Brush across the top of the chewing surfaces of the teeth. Make sure the
bristles get into the groves and crevices. Use the same small circular motion to clean the backside of the upper and
lower teeth -- the side that faces the tongue. To clean the inside of the bottom front teeth, angle the head in an
up-and-down position toward the bottom inside of the mouth and move the
toothbrush in a small circle. For the inside of the top front teeth, angle the brush in an up-and-down
position with the tip of the head pointing towards the roof of the mouth. Move
the toothbrush in a small circle. Give your tongue a few gentle brush strokes, brushing from the back of your
tongue forward. Do not scrub. This helps remove bacteria and freshens your
breath. After brushing your teeth for two to three minutes, rinse your mouth with
water. Replace your toothbrush with a new one every 3 to 4 months."
Tips for Flossing,"'Floss once a day. Flossing gets rid of food and plaque between the teeth,where your toothbrush cannot reach. If plaque stays between teeth, it canharden into tartar, which must be removed by a dentist. To floss:' Remove about an 18-inch strip of floss from the dispenser. Wind the floss around the middle fingers of each hand, leaving a 1-inch
section open for flossing. Floss the top teeth first, then the bottom. Place the floss in your mouth and use your index fingers to push the floss
between the teeth. Be careful not to push too hard and injure the gums. Move the floss up and down against the tooth and up and around the gum
line. The floss should form a C-shape around the tooth as you floss. Floss between each tooth as well as behind the back teeth. Use a clean section of floss as needed and take up used floss by winding it
around the fingers."
Tips for Eating Right,"'Eat a variety of foods but eat fewer foods that contain sugars and starches.These foods produce the most acids in the mouth and the longer they stay in themouth, the more they can damage the teeth. Hard ""sucking candies"" areespecially harmful because they stay in the mouth a long time.'""Snacking on sugary foods can lead to tooth decay because most people don'tbrush after snacks. Starchy snack foods, like potato chips, stick to the teeth.Avoid snacking on:"" Candies, cookies, cakes and pie Sugary gum Crackers, breadsticks and chips Dried fruits and raisins"
Dental Check-Ups,"""Visit your dentist at least once every six months. To maintain healthy teethand gums, it's important to have regular check-ups and professional cleanings.You should also see your dentist if you have ""'pain'' in your teeth or mouth orbleeding, swollen gums.''You can also ask your dentist about ''dental sealants''. Sealant is a material used to coat the top, chewingsurfaces of the teeth. This coating protects the tooth from decay and usuallylasts a long time.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Reviewed by Brunilda Nazario, MD, on October 22, 2007''Portions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic 2000-2005' "
When to Start Caring for Your Baby's Teeth,"""It's a good idea to get in the habit of cleaning your baby's gums evenbefore teeth emerge.""""To clean your baby's mouth:"" Lay your baby in your lap with his or her head close to your chest. Gently, but firmly, rub a clean and damp piece of gauze or washcloth along
both the upper and lower gums. Clean the gums at least two times a day -- after breakfast and after the
last feeding of the day. Even better -- clean your baby's gums after every
feeding."
What Is Teething?,"'''Teething'' refers to the time when baby teeth (also called deciduous teeth orprimary teeth) appear. Generally, teething first occurs between 6 months and 24months of age. While this process is uneventful in some children; for others,it causes quite a bit of discomfort and irritability.'""      Check out this tooth chart andlearn when to expect your baby's teeth to appear."" "
What Are Symptoms of Teething?,"'Symptoms include:''Teething does not result in ''fever'', ''vomiting'', or ''diarrhea''. If your child experiences these problems, contact your doctor.' Increased irritability Placing objects or fingers in the mouth and biting down on them Increased saliva or drooling Loss of appetite or becoming choosy about foods Tender and swollen gums Rash on cheeks or redness in the area of the cheeks near the affected gums Restlessness Ear pulling, which may be a sign of teething or possibly an ear infection (make an appointment to have your child seen by your doctor or pediatrician)"
What Can I Do to Ease Teething Pain?,"'Teething biscuits or cookies and frozen bananas are not recommended. Theseobjects promote tooth decay and may cause your child to choke.' Massage your child's gums with a clean finger or the back of a small cold
spoon Allow your child to bite down on a chilled (but never frozen) teething
ring. A frozen teething ring can damage the gums. Try an over-the-counter teething ointment to numb the gums. Ask your
dentist or doctor for some product recommendations. Allow your child to suck on a cold, wet cloth"
What Should I Do if My Baby Was Born With Teeth?,"'Some infants are born with one or more teeth (called natal teeth) or mayhave teeth emerge within the first 30 days of life (called ''neonatal'' teeth).'""These usually are either extra teeth or are remnants from neonataldevelopment that do not need treatment. If they are, however, actual teeth,it's a good idea to maintain them. Your doctor, however, may recommend removingthem if the teeth are loose and pose a danger of being inhaled by your baby.Early teeth may also interfere with feeding or irritate your baby's tongue.""'Talk to your doctor to see what treatment is right for your baby.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Reviewed by Jay H.

What are cavities?,'Dental ''cavities'' are holes in ''teeth'' caused by tooth decay. Cavities are also referred to as ''caries''.' 
What are microcavities?,"'Teeth'' are in an environment of constant acid attack that strips the teeth of important ''minerals'' and breaks the teeth down. While this attack is constantly occurring, minerals are also be constantly replenished through mineral-rich saliva and fluoridated water and ''toothpaste''. In addition to fluoride, calcium and phosphate also help to remineralize enamel. When the demineralization starts and is confined to the outermost layer of enamel, it is called a microcavity, or incipient ''cavity''. These types of cavities rarely need anything more than very conservative treatment. Only when the cavity breaks through the enamel layer and into the dentin does it really threaten the tooth. So when these microcavities are detected, it is best to try a remineralization protocol to see if they can be reversed instead of jumping to a filling right away. A dentist will help in determining the most effective conservative treatment for these early cavities.'""The dentist's goal is to achieve a healthy balance between ""'prevention'"" and restoration. It is a balance between being proactive and reactive. The dentist doesn't want to be so proactive that he is recommending things that don't need to be done -- preventing problems that realistically never would have occurred. But he doesn't want to be so reactive that he simply watches small problems become big problems. One mistake people often make is waiting for ""'pain'' to dictate the timing of treatment. Once a tooth starts hurting, it is often too late for remineralization or a small filling. ''Pain'' usually indicates a need for ''root canal'' treatment, a ''crown'"", or tooth extraction. There is some variability in how dentists will treat microcavities and when they determine a filling is necessary. Some people are more prone to caries than others. Analyzing one's history of cavities, current ""'diet'', and oral hygiene may lead the dentist to be more aggressive or more conservative with his recommendations. This is why it is important that each person finds a dentist that echoes his or her own philosophy regarding aggressive versus conservative dental treatment.''Regardless of the dentist, regular returns to the dentist are key to being conservative so the cavity can be monitored and treated before it grows too much. Small cavities can become root canals within a year under the right circumstances. As a cavity grows, more tooth structure is lost. Lost tooth structure leads to a greater likelihood of fractured teeth, recurrent decay, and tooth loss. When possible, one is always better off getting a small filling than ending up with a large filling, a root canal, or a crown.' "
How does a cavity form?,"'Two main factors contribute to tooth decay -- bacteria in the mouth and a ''diet'' high in ''sugar'' and starch. There are over 500 different types of bacteria that are normally present in the mouth. These bacteria combine with food and saliva to form a sticky substance called plaque that attaches to teeth. Foods rich in starches add to the stickiness of the plaque, which begins to get hard if it remains on the teeth after a couple of days and turns into tartar or calculus. Bacteria in the plaque convert ''sugar'' into acid that dissolves the tooth structure, causing holes, or cavities. Because of these two contributing factors, dental caries have been described as a ""dietobacterial"" disease.'""The parts of teeth that are most vulnerable to tooth decay are areas where plaque can accumulate most easily. Plaque tends to settle into the pits and fissures in the tops of teeth, into the areas in between the teeth, and next to the gum line. Where there is plaque, there are bacteria and acid, and eventually destruction of the tooth surface. The cavity starts in the outer layer of the tooth (enamel) and as it gets deeper, penetrates into the softer inner layer of the tooth (dentin).  Typically, it isn't until the decay reaches the dentin that a person will start to notice signs and symptoms of the cavity.""

 "
What risk factors contribute to tooth decay?,"'Saliva helps prevent plaque from attaching to teeth and helps wash away and digest food particles. A low salivary flow or ''dry mouth'"" leaves the teeth more vulnerable to tooth decay. This is particularly common in patients with diseases that feature dryness of the mouth, such as Sjögren's syndrome and other diseases of the salivary glands. Genetic factors that affect tooth decay are the following:"" Tooth size and shape: Small teeth with numerous deep pits and grooves will be more vulnerable to cavity formation than large teeth with fewer and shallower grooves.  The grooves and pits provide areas for plaque to build up and are difficult to brush thoroughly. Thickness of enamel: Enamel is the tooth's main defense against cavities, so the more of it a person has, the longer it will take for a cavity to break through to the inside of the tooth. Tooth position and bite: Crooked, overlapped teeth provide more areas for plaque to accumulate and are harder to keep clean.  Many problems can occur if the bite is poorly aligned.  Poor alignment of the bite can cause the enamel on certain teeth to wear down rapidly, leaving soft dentin exposed. Orthodontics is a great cavity-prevention measure because straight teeth that are in a proper bite position tend to stay cleaner and more cavity-free throughout a person's lifetime. Tooth eruption time and sequence: People who get their permanent teeth earlier in life are at greater risk for cavities because oral hygiene practices may not be developed yet."
What are the signs and symptoms of cavities?,"'When a cavity advances deep into the tooth, it may produce increased sensitivity to foods that are ''cold'', hot, or sweet. But not all cavities will cause a ''toothache''. If they are small or progressing slowly, they may only be detected by a dentist before they cause pain. Cavities on front teeth are easiest for a person to see, and they will be visible as a light or dark brown spot.  The brown spot is tooth structure that has become soft due to the acid attack from bacteria.  Generally, light brown represents a fast-growing cavity and dark brown represents a slower-growing cavity.  If the cavity gets large enough, part of the affected tooth may break off and leave a hole. ' "
How are cavities diagnosed?,"'A dentist can detect a cavity by using a sharp instrument to feel tooth structure that has been softened by tooth decay. If a cavity forms in between the teeth, it may only be visible on an X-ray. Other diagnostic tools that are used to detect cavities include ''ultrasound'', fluorescence, or fiberoptic transillumination.  Regular dental exams are recommended so cavities can be diagnosed when they are small cavities (incipient caries or microcavities) instead of waiting until they grow large enough to produce pain and require more extensive treatment.' "
What is the treatment for cavities?,"'There are three things to consider in the treatment of dental cavities: prevention, remineralization, and restoration.''Prevention'"": A greater emphasis on preventive dentistry has helped reduce the incidence of premature tooth loss. Since we can't eliminate the bacteria that are in the mouth, limiting the amount and frequency of sugars and starches in our diet is the easiest way to prevent dental caries. Maintaining a healthy diet to prevent tooth decay is very important in children and toddlers both for ""'baby teeth'' and as they start to get their adult teeth. Sugary soft ''drinks'' and juices are especially harmful to the teeth. When possible, sweeteners such as ''sucralose'"" should be substituted for sucrose because they can't be digested by bacteria. Xylitol is another sugar substitute that actually kills bacteria, so chewing xylitol gum after meals will greatly reduce the incidence of cavities. Plaque can be removed from the outside of teeth by brushing and from in between the teeth with dental floss. Use of a mouthwash also helps by limiting the number of harmful bacteria in the mouth. A dentist will often suggest placing ""'plastic'"" sealants in the pits and grooves of teeth in children to protect them from decay. Visiting the dentist regularly will help prevent cavities from forming or catch them when they're small.""'Remineralization'': Shallow cavities can be reversed when they are treated with a substance that contains fluoride or calcium. This ""rehardening"" process is known as tooth remineralization. Fluoride makes the enamel more resistant to cavities and can be applied to teeth through fluoride toothpastes, ''supplements'', dental office fluoride treatments and varnishes, and fluoridated water. The amount of fluoride exposure must be carefully controlled though, because high levels can be toxic.''Restoration'': When a cavity is too large to be remineralized, it must be restored. If the cavity is still small, it can be restored with a filling made of composite or silver amalgam. If a large part of the tooth is decayed, it will need to be covered with a crown. Crowns are typically made of gold, porcelain, or zirconium. If the cavity has extended to the center of the tooth and infected the nerve, a root canal will have to be performed. Sometimes, the cavity infects a majority of the tooth surface and the tooth has to be extracted. Areas where teeth have been extracted can usually be restored with ''dental implants'' or ''bridges'"". Baby teeth that get cavities may be restored with a filling, a stainless steel crown, extraction, or pulpotomy. It is very important that kids get their baby teeth treated so that abscesses don't form and oral disease doesn't keep increasing into adulthood.""  "
Treatment of cavities during pregnancy,"'Hormonal and bacterial quantity changes during ''pregnancy'' put ''pregnant'' women at greater risk for ''gingivitis'' and periodontal disease. Therefore, it is very important that pregnant women continue to get regular dental cleanings during pregnancy. Pregnant women have generally been counseled to avoid elective dental treatment during pregnancy unless they are experiencing an emergency like pain or infection. In this case, the ''second trimester'"" is the best time for treatment to keep the expectant mother as comfortable as possible. Local anesthetics and other materials used during dental treatment don't increase risk to the fetus, but untreated oral disease has been shown to lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. If ""'X-rays'"" are necessary, a protective apron will be placed over the woman's stomach and thyroid.  If antibiotics are necessary, ""'tetracycline'"" should be avoided because it will cause staining in the baby's developing teeth. ""  "
What is CAMBRA?,"""CAMBRA stands for caries management by risk assessment.  It is a method for assessing a person's risk for developing dental cavities and making dental treatment decisions and recommendations based on the patient's caries risk.  The dentist performing CAMBRA will perform tests for oral bacteria and take X-rays.  He will then determine the patient's level of caries risk by analyzing caries history, current caries condition, dietary habits, hygiene habits, prescription medications, salivary flow, and medical conditions.  Treatment will then be tailored to the patient based on managing the risk factors through behavioral, chemical, and minimally invasive procedures.  No two cavities are the same because no two people are the same.  Thus, diagnosis and treatment planning requires risk assessment in addition to caries detection."" "
What is the prognosis of a cavity?,"' Dental cavities are a preventable and treatable disease.  By making simple changes in diet and hygiene, one can minimize the risk of developing caries.  If a person has been diagnosed as being at high risk for dental cavities, the dentist may prescribe a prescription toothpaste or fluoride varnish to protect the restored teeth from getting recurrent caries and prevent new ones from forming.  Consistent evaluation and follow-up with a licensed dentist combined with attentive oral hygiene will help a person affected by dental cavities to have a very favorable prognosis.' "
What is a dental crown?," The anatomy of a tooth can be divided into two basic parts -- the root and the crown. In a person with healthy gums and bone, the root of the tooth is covered by the gums and bone. The crown is the part of the tooth visible in the mouth, above the gum line on lower teeth and below the gum line on upper teeth. A cemented restoration that partially or completely covers the outside of the tooth is referred to as a dental crown or cap."
How much do crowns cost?,"'The cost of getting a crown can vary widely depending on the materials used and the expertise of the dentist and lab technician. Insurance will typically cover part of the expense, but the amount varies with each carrier and plan. A person should expect to pay anywhere between $600 and $2,000 for a crown or veneer.'  "
Other relevant terms,"'Crown preparation'': This is the design of the tooth after it has been shaved down to allow room for a crown. The preparation design depends on the material that the crown will be made from, previous ''fillings'', ''fractures'', and ''root canal'' therapy. There must be enough tooth structure for the crown to adhere onto.''Margin'': This is the edge of the crown that meets the prepared surface of the tooth. This needs to be smooth with no gaps or ledges.''Cusps'': These are the raised or pointy parts of a toothn that are the primary tools for tearing and chewing food. When a cusp has been damaged from a ''cavity'' or ''fracture'', the tooth needs a crown to prevent further damage.''Partial crown/onlay'': This is a restoration that only covers some of the cusps of the tooth, but not all of them. This restoration is chosen as a conservative measure to preserve as much tooth structure as possible. When conditions allow, this is the preferred type of crown restoration.''Dental veneer'': Porcelain veneers are partial crowns that cover only the front and biting edge of teeth. These all-ceramic restorations are usually placed on front teeth to change the color or shape of teeth or add symmetry and balance to a smile. Since they are sometimes placed on crooked teeth, treatment with veneers has sometimes been referred to as ""instant ''orthodontics''.""''Temporary/provisional'"": This is a temporary crown that is placed on the tooth while waiting for the final crown to be made by the dental lab. Temporary crowns shouldn't be left on a tooth for very long because they are made of weak materials and cemented with weak cement that doesn't seal the tooth for very long. Occasionally, a temporary crown will purposely be left on for a prolonged period of time by the dentist to make sure it becomes free of ""'pain'' or other symptoms.' "
When is a dental crown needed?,"'There are a variety of situations that require a tooth to be restored with a dental crown. The following are the most common:''Large filling'': When a tooth has a ''cavity'' or fracture that involves half the width of the tooth or more, it needs to be covered with a crown. This is because the remaining tooth around the large filling is so weak that it is prone to fracture. Sometimes a large filling that has been in the mouth for a while will need to be replaced with a crown because the tooth shows signs of ''stress'' and cracks around the filling.''Root canal'': Root canal treatment leaves the tooth hollowed out and predisposes the remaining tooth to cracking. So, a tooth that has had a root canal almost always needs to be restored with a crown immediately to prevent it from fracturing.''Cracked tooth syndrome'': This is a condition whereby a patient has fractures inside a tooth that cause ''pain'' when it is chewed on a certain way. Chewing produces ''stress'"" on fracture lines that make it feel like it is splitting apart. A crown will hold the tooth together and redistribute the stress evenly throughout the tooth, eliminating the pain in most instances. In these situations, it is best to leave a temporary crown on for a while to make sure the pain goes away and the tooth doesn't require a root canal.""'Broken cusps'': Cusps frequently break off of teeth due to ''trauma'' or large existing fillings. Since the cusps are the part of the tooth that take the most stress during chewing, they need to be completely covered or the tooth or filling will keep fracturing. Sometimes the tooth breaks all the way to the bone, and a crown-lengthening procedure is necessary. This means the bone and gums need to be trimmed down below the edge of the fractured part of the tooth so the margin of the crown can be placed on healthy, strong tooth structure.''Excessive wear of teeth'': If a person has a habit of grinding their teeth, the teeth will become shorter over time. The teeth can also wear away due to acid erosion caused by gastrointestinal ''acid reflux'' (''GERD''), ''bulimia'', or an acidic ''diet''. Sometimes, the enamel will wear away completely, leaving small, soft teeth. Over time, the bite can collapse and the only way of restoring the teeth to normal size is by covering the teeth with crowns.''Undesirable appearance of teeth'': Teeth that have an unacceptable appearance due to color, shape, or spaces between teeth can be made to look very natural and beautiful with crowns. ''Dental veneers'"" are a very effective and conservative way of enhancing the look of the front teeth. They can be made to look very natural, and sometimes they don't even require preparing or shaving the existing teeth.""'Other'': Crowns are placed on ''dental implants'' to restore spaces left from missing teeth. Another way of filling these spaces is with dental ''bridges'', which are made from crowns on the teeth next to the spaces attached to fake teeth in the middle. If teeth are loose, crowns can be placed on multiple teeth and splinted together to provide more stability.' "
What types of dental crowns are available?,"'Crowns can be made out of a gold alloy, some other metal alloy, stainless steel, all-porcelain/all-ceramic, composite resin, zirconia, or porcelain on the outside fused to metal or zirconia on the inside.''In some cases, ceramic crowns can be made with ''CAD''/''CAM'' technology by milling the crowns out of blocks of porcelain in the dental office, without the need for temporaries or a dental laboratory. There are advantages and disadvantages to all of the types of ''dental crowns''.' Stainless steel crowns are preformed crowns used to cover baby teeth for children. Gold dental crowns have traditionally been the most durable and require less of the tooth to be removed or shaved down. The primary advantage of porcelain crowns is their esthetics, while newer types of ceramic crowns have become increasingly more durable."
What is the procedure for getting a dental crown?,"""The dental crown procedure first involves numbing the tooth with local anesthesia.  If the tooth has been fractured or had a root canal treatment, it will first need to have a buildup -- a filling that restores enough of the tooth for the crown to hold onto. Then the tooth is shaved down to make room for the crown, and an impression is made of the prepared tooth with a putty-like substance or a digital scanner. The dentist will then determine the shade of the patient's teeth using a shade guide or take pictures of the teeth to help the lab technician make crowns that will match the rest of the patient's teeth. A temporary crown is made from a resin or acrylic material using a molding or ""'stent'' of the original tooth. This temporary crown is cemented with temporary cement so that it can come off easily once the permanent crown is ready.''Usually a few weeks after a temporary crown, the patient returns for a second visit. During this visit, the tooth may or may not need to be numbed again and the temporary crown is removed. The permanent crown is placed on the tooth and inspected for acceptable fit, bite, and smooth margins. After any necessary adjustments have been performed, the crown is cemented with a permanent cement or dental glue.' "
Is there pain associated with getting a dental crown?,"""The tooth being restored is numbed so that it isn't painful during the crown preparation. This requires a shot in the gums of ""'lidocaine'"" or another local anesthetic. After the procedure is over and the anesthesia has worn off, the patient may feel some sensitivity with the temporary crown or some soreness in the gums around the tooth. The pain is very minimal though and shouldn't last long.""  "
Are there any special considerations for getting a dental crown during pregnancy?,"'If it is possible, it is best to wait until after ''pregnancy'' for elective dental procedures to minimize stress on both the mother and baby. Getting crowns is often the result of a sudden fracture or other unavoidable situation though, and treatment may need to be immediate. The materials used for crowns are all safe during pregnancy, so when necessary, it is possible to get a dental crown during pregnancy.'  "
What kind of problems may occur after getting a dental crown?,"'Crown preparation sometimes places a lot of stress on a tooth, causing the nerve to become irreversibly inflamed. If this happens, the tooth may need root canal treatment.' "
How long do dental crowns last?,"'Dental crowns should last on average from 10 to 20 years. Crowns are still subject to fracture and ''cavities'', so it is important to take extra care in brushing and flossing around crowned teeth to prevent them from needing replacement too often. When all-ceramic crowns or veneers are present, it is often advisable to wear a mouth guard to protect the porcelain from fracturing and prolong the life of the crowns.' "
What are dental implants?,"'Dental implants as we know them today were invented in 1952 by a Swedish orthopedic surgeon named Per-Ingvar Brånemark. Today, they are considered the standard of care for prosthetic replacement of missing ''teeth'' in dentistry. A ''dental implant'' is a surgical fixture that is placed into the jawbone and allowed to fuse with the bone over the span of a few months. The dental implant acts as a replacement for the root of a missing tooth. In turn, this ""artificial tooth root"" serves to hold a replacement tooth or ''bridge''. Having a dental implant fused to the jawbone is the closest thing to mimicking a natural tooth because it stands on its own without affecting the nearby ''teeth'' and has great stability. The process of fusion between the dental implant and jawbone is called ""osseointegration."" Most dental implants are made of titanium, which allows them to integrate with bone without being recognized as a foreign object in our body. Over time, technology and science have progressed to greatly improve the outcomes of dental implant placement. Today, the success rate for dental implants is close to 98%.' "
Why would you need a dental implant?,"'Dental implants can be used to replace a single tooth, several teeth, or all of the teeth. The goal of teeth replacement in dentistry is to restore function as well as esthetics.''When it comes to tooth replacement, generally, there are three options:''Dentures'' are the more affordable option for replacement teeth but are the least desirable because of the inconvenience of a removable appliance in the mouth. Furthermore, ''dentures'"" can affect one's taste and sensory experience with food.""'Dental bridgework was the more common restorative option prior to the relatively recent shift to dental implant treatment. The main disadvantage to bridgework is the dependence on existing natural teeth for support. Implants are supported by bone only and do not affect surrounding natural teeth. Deciding on which option to choose depends on many factors. Specifically for dental implants, these factors include''A dental surgeon examines the area to be considered for the dental implant and makes a clinical assessment of whether the patient is a good candidate for a dental implant.'""There are great advantages to choosing a dental implant for tooth replacement over the other options. Dental implants are conservative in that missing teeth can be replaced without affecting or altering the adjacent teeth. Furthermore, because dental implants integrate into the bone structure, they are very stable and can have the look and feel of one's own natural teeth."" removable dental appliance (complete denture or partial denture), fixed dental bridge (cemented), and dental implant. location of missing tooth or teeth, quantity and quality of the jawbone where the dental implant is to be placed, health of the patient, cost, and patient preference."
What are the types of dental implants? Why are they used?,"'Historically, there have been two different types of dental implants:''While the primary function of dental implants is for teeth replacement, there are areas in which implants can assist in other dental procedures. Due to their stability, dental implants can be used to support a removable denture and provide a more secure and comfortable fit. In addition, for ''orthodontics'' procedures, dental mini-implants can act as temporary anchorage devices (TAD) to help move teeth to a desired position. These mini-implants are small and temporarily fixed to bone while assisting in anchorage for teeth movement. They are subsequently removed after their function has been served.''For patients who have lost all their teeth due to decay or ''gum disease'' of the upper and/or lower arch, an option is available to provide a very stable and comfortable prosthesis using a minimal number of implants. One such is example is the ""All-On-4"" technique that was named by implant manufacturer Nobel Biocare. This technique gets its name from the idea that four implants can be used to replace all teeth in a single arch (upper or lower). The implants are strategically placed in areas of good strong bone, and a thin denture prosthesis is screwed into place. The All-On-4 technique provides teeth replacement that is stable (not removable) and feels like natural teeth compared to the older method of traditional (removable) complete dentures. Without a doubt, implant dentistry has allowed for more treatment options to replace single and multiple missing teeth with long-term stability and contributes to improved ''oral health''.' endosteal and subperiosteal. Endosteal refers to an implant that is ""in the bone,"" and subperiosteal refers to an implant that rests on top of the jawbone under the gum tissue. Subperiosteal implants are no longer in use today because of their poor long-term results in comparison to endosteal dental implants."
"What happens before, during, and after dental implant surgery?","'During the consult and planning stage, the dental surgeon will visually examine the site in the mouth where a dental implant is being considered as well as look at dental imaging studies (''X-rays'', panoramic films, and/or ''CT scans''). At this time, the quality and quantity of jawbone is assessed to determine if more bone is needed at the site. Once it has been established that a dental implant can be placed in the desired location, the patient will return for surgical procedures for the dental implant(s). During all surgical procedure appointments, the patient is usually given local anesthetic to numb the surgical area as well as any other ''sedatives'' necessary for comfort and ''anxiety''.''The first stage of ''oral surgery'' often involves a tooth or teeth extraction. Oftentimes, the site of a dental implant still has an existing damaged tooth present. In order to prepare for placement of a dental implant, the tooth will need to be extracted. More often than not, an ""alveolar bone graft"" (cadaver or synthetic bone) is placed to achieve a solid base of bone for the implant. This site will be allowed to heal for two to six months. For a site that has no tooth and bone loss is present, it will require a different bone graft that is placed on top of existing jawbone (""onlay bone graft""). This procedure is more involved and usually requires about six or more months of healing. In some instances, when enough bone is present, the damaged tooth can be extracted followed by the implant placement procedure at the same appointment. This procedure is called ""immediate implant"" placement.''In the situation where an implant is to be placed in the maxilla (upper jaw) in the back or posterior region, sometimes the available amount of bone may be limited by the presence of the maxillary sinus (air-filled space found in the bones of the face). ""Sinus augmentation"" or ""sinus lift"" is performed to raise the sinus floor and graft more bone into the sinus. This will make more bone available to support a dental implant.''Once adequate, strong bone is present, the site is ready for the implant. At the implant placement appointment, the dental implant (titanium post) is placed into the bone with a special drill and tools. A ""healing cap"" is placed over the implant, the gum is stitched up, and the healing phase begins. During this healing phase, a temporary denture can be made to replace missing teeth for esthetic purposes. Healing time depends greatly on the quality of bone present. Healing time is usually anywhere from two to six months. During this time, the implant becomes integrated with the bone. It\'s important to avoid placing any force or ''stress'' on the dental implant as it heals. Follow-up appointments to check the surgical site are typically done to ensure that no infection exists and healing is taking place.''After the required healing period, the dental implant is tested to determine whether it was successfully taken up by the surrounding bone. Once this has been confirmed, a prosthetic component is connected to the dental implant via a screw. This component is called an ""abutment."" It will serve to hold the replacement tooth or ""''crown''."" The dentist will take an impression (''mold'') of this abutment in the mouth and have the implant crown custom-made to fit. The implant crown is either cemented on or secured with a screw to the abutment.'  "
How much does a dental implant cost? Does insurance pay for dental implants?,"   The cost of a single dental implant can vary depending on the region and who is performing the procedure. A conservative cost estimate for a single dental implant is $3,000-$4,500. This cost includes the surgery for placement of an implant, all the components, and the implant crown. Dental insurance typically does not pay for dental implant placement. Some dental insurances may help pay for the implant crown portion. Unfortunately, in many cases, dental insurance considers dental implants to be an elective procedure even though dental implants have become the standard of care for replacement of missing teeth. Dental implants have become a favored option for tooth replacement because they offer a conservative approach and provide predictable results with success rates close to 98%."
"What are the potential risks, complications, and problems with a dental implant?","'With any surgery, there are always some risks and potential complications to the patient or to the success of a dental implant. Careful planning is important to ensure that a patient is healthy enough to undergo oral surgery and heal properly. Just like any oral surgery procedure, ''bleeding disorders'', infections, ''allergies'', existing medical conditions, and medications need careful review prior to proceeding with treatment. Fortunately, the success rate is quite high and failures usually occur in the unlikely event of infection, ''fracture'' of the dental implant, overloading of the dental implant, damage to the surrounding area (nerves, blood vessels, teeth), poor positioning of the dental implant, or poor bone quantity or quality. Again, careful planning with a qualified surgeon can help avoid these problems. In many cases, another attempt can be made to replace a failed dental implant after the requisite time for healing has taken place.'  "
Is dental implant surgery painful?,"   Dental implant surgery is usually performed under local anesthetic, and therefore, no pain should be felt during the procedure. After the local anesthetic has worn off, the post-surgery discomfort will vary with each individual case. However, in general, most people will feel discomfort similar to a tooth extraction afterward. A cold ice pack is placed on skin over the area of surgery immediately after treatment to help reduce swelling. This pain typically can be managed with over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen (Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol). More invasive surgery may require a stronger prescription pain medication and more recovery time. Aside from pain medications, prescriptions for antibiotics and oral rinses may be needed to support healing of the area for the following few weeks."
What follow-up care is necessary after getting a dental implant?," Dental implants have the risk of developing a condition called ""peri-implantitis,"" which is the equivalent of periodontal (gum) disease for natural teeth. This refers to inflammation of the gum and bone surrounding the implant. The inflammation of the surrounding tissues is often due to excessive biting forces on the implant or bacterial infection. Peri-implantitis can result in the loss of an implant if left untreated. After getting a dental implant, routine maintenance care at home and follow-up at the dental office are essential in avoiding this condition. Good oral hygiene for a dental implant at home involves routine brushing and flossing to keep food debris and plaque away. In the dental office, the surrounding soft and hard tissues are examined and special tools are used to remove harder calcified deposits around the dental implant. If needed, the bite is adjusted to ensure that the implant does not sustain heavy biting forces."
What types of doctors specialize in dental implants?,"'Implant surgery can be performed by any licensed dentist provided that the treatment follows the standard of care and is in the best interest of the patient. However, since implants are surgically placed in the jawbone, dental specialists who routinely perform surgery within the jawbone are the natural fit for implant surgery. Oral maxillofacial surgeons (oral surgeons) treat all hard and soft-tissue diseases or defects, which includes extraction of teeth and jaw surgeries. Periodontists treat disease of the surrounding structures of teeth such as the gum and jawbone. Both oral surgeons and periodontists often specialize in dental implant placement.''Once the implant has integrated fully into the jawbone, the next phase involves placement of the implant crown that will be supported by the implant. This is typically performed by the general dentist or a prosthodontist (dental specialist focused on tooth replacement).' "
What are common causes of dental injuries?,"'Trauma'' to the face or ''teeth'' can be caused by auto accidents, falls, and injury from a variety of sports, such as football, hockey, soccer, volleyball, basketball, and baseball. Patients suffering significant head, neck, or facial trauma should be evaluated and treated in a hospital emergency room setting. Such trauma may involve bleeding from the nose or ears, ''concussion'', ''dizziness'', lapse of memory, disorientation, severe ''headache'', ''earache'', or breaking (fracture) of the skull and/or jaws. Most hospitals have on staff oral surgeons who can treat ''fractures'' of the upper or lower jaw and perform emergency tooth removal (dental extractions) and reconstruction of the dental arches.''Wear and tear due to ''cavities'' and chewing or biting down on hard objects, such as pencils, ice cubes, nuts, and hard candies, can also lead to tooth fractures. Dental injury without associated head and neck trauma can usually be evaluated and treated in a dental office. Such dental injuries include broken teeth (fractured teeth), teeth totally knocked out of the mouth, or teeth displaced by unexpected external forces. These dental injuries include swelling of the gum and oral tissue. ''Cold'' packs or ice cubes placed inside the mouth over the injured tooth or outside on the cheeks or lips can reduce ''pain'' and swelling before the patient reaches the dentist.' "
How is a tooth fracture treated?,"'Tooth fractures can range from minor (involving chipping of the outer tooth layers called enamel and dentin) to severe (involving vertical, diagonal, or horizontal fractures of the tooth and/or root). Enamel and dentin are the two outer protective layers of the tooth. The enamel is the outermost white hard surface. The dentin is a yellow layer lying just beneath the enamel. Enamel and dentin both serve to protect the inner living tooth tissue called the pulp. The portion of the tooth that is visible in the mouth is called the crown and is only a part of the entire tooth structure. The remaining portion of the tooth is buried in the bone and is called the root. Different tests are performed in the mouth to determine if a tooth fracture is present. In some instances, ''dental X-rays'' can help to diagnose, locate, and measure the extent of tooth fractures.'  "
What are treatment options for a serious tooth fracture?,"'A serious fracture is one that exposes both the dentin and the pulp tissue and should be treated promptly. Serious fractures may make the tooth displaced and loose, and cause the gums to bleed. To prevent the loose tooth from falling out completely, the dentist can splint the loose tooth by bonding it to the adjacent teeth to help stabilize it while the underlying bone and gums heal. Because of the high risk of pulp infection after the exposure of the pulp to the oral environment, a ''root canal'' procedure may need to be performed during the first visit. Alternatively, the dentist may elect to only apply a sedative dressing on the splinted tooth to help calm the ''tooth pain''. The tooth will then be reevaluated in two to four weeks to determine if a root canal procedure is necessary. If the tooth appears to have recovered and is stable in the mouth, the splint is removed at that time and a filling or crown is placed to restore the fractured tooth. The tooth may still require periodic monitoring over time (months to a year) to determine if any further treatment will be needed.''The most serious injuries involve vertical, diagonal, or horizontal fractures of the tooth roots. In most instances, a fracture of the tooth root leaves the injured tooth very loose and unable to be restored with dental work, thus necessitating tooth extraction. The extracted tooth is often replaced with a removable plate containing a false tooth as a temporary measure until a more definite plan for tooth replacement is made. There are some specific instances where teeth with horizontal fractures near the tip of the root may not need extraction. Root canal treatment for the injured tooth may be required in the future if symptoms of pulp death and tooth infection appear. Periodic dental ''X-rays'' of the fractured tooth are performed to monitor it closely.' "
What is the treatment for a chipped tooth?,"'A minor tooth fracture usually involves chipping of the enamel only. The tooth is not displaced out of its position and there is no bleeding from the gums. The only symptom of such minor chipping may be sharp or rough tooth edges that irritate the cheek and tongue. The injured tooth itself may not be painful or sensitive to food or temperature. The risk of pulp injury is low and treatment is usually not considered urgent. A small amount of orthodontic wax or sugarless gum can be placed over the rough edge until the dentist can be seen. Depending on the amount of enamel lost, definitive treatment usually involves placing a dental filling or a crown to restore the tooth to normal contour.' "
How is a fracture of the enamel and dentin treated?,"'A deeper fracture can involve both the enamel and the dentin of a tooth. Even though a deep fracture is present, the tooth may not be displaced or out of position and the gums may not be bleeding. These deeper fractures may be sensitive to changes in temperature, chewing, or biting. Prolonged exposure of dentin leaves the tooth vulnerable to decay that can advance rapidly. Therefore, fractures involving the dentin are treated promptly. Treatment involves placing a dental filling or a crown. Unless there are continuing symptoms of ''pain'', the tooth can be monitored with routine dental X-rays to ensure that the tooth is healthy.'""If a fracture has significantly injured the pulp, then treatment involves either extraction of the tooth or root canal treatment. Extraction is indicated if the tooth has been significantly weakened by the fracture and its form and function cannot be properly restored. If the tooth's form and function can be restored, root canal treatment is performed to prevent infection. This procedure involves removing all the dying pulp tissue and replacing it with an inert material in order to keep infection out. Once the root canal treatment is complete, the tooth can be restored with a filling or crown."" "
What are first aid tips for knocked out teeth?,"'The upper front permanent teeth are the most common teeth to be completely knocked out (""avulsed""). Primary (baby) teeth that are knocked out from injury are usually not reimplanted into the mouth since they will be replaced naturally by permanent teeth later.''In the event of having a permanent tooth knocked out, care should be taken to handle the tooth only by its crown (chewing surface) and not by its root, gently rinsed in clean water or milk and placed back (reimplanted) into the socket from where it came. This can be done by the patient or parent and then checked by the dentist. If the parent or patient is unsure about reimplanting the tooth, then the tooth should be stored in milk or an emergency tooth preservation solution and brought to the dentist as soon as possible. Alternatively, in older children and adults who are calm, the tooth may be held within the cheeks inside of the mouth while traveling to the dental office. Unfortunately, water is not considered a good storage medium for a tooth for long periods of time. The most important variable affecting the success of reimplantation is the amount of time that the tooth is out of its socket. Teeth reimplanted within one hour of the accident frequently reattach to their teeth sockets.''After reimplanting the tooth into its original socket, the dentist can then splint this tooth to adjacent teeth for two to eight weeks. Splinting helps to stabilize the tooth while the bone and tissue around it heals. During the splinting period, the patient should eat soft foods, avoid biting on the splinted teeth, and brush all the other teeth diligently to keep the mouth as clean as possible.''In adults, the reimplanted tooth should have a root canal procedure within seven to 10 days. Reimplanted permanent teeth in children (where the tooth root has not yet completely formed) may not need a root canal procedure. These teeth should be observed for at least five years for signs and symptoms such as pain, discoloration, gum abscess, or abscess visible on a dental X-ray, which could indicate a dying pulp.''In most patients who have had tooth reimplantation, ''over-the-counter'' medications like ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') are sufficient for pain relief. Since the splinted teeth cannot be brushed normally and the splint usually collects extra dental plaque and food debris, chlorhexidine gluconate (''Peridex'') mouth rinse may be prescribed to prevent and control gum inflammation (''gingivitis''). Oral antibiotics and a ''tetanus'' toxoid injection are considered for patients with accompanying significant soft-tissue ''cuts'' (lacerations).' "
What is the treatment for a displaced tooth?,"'Instead of being completely knocked out of the mouth, a tooth can be displaced into another position. In the mouth, a displaced tooth may be pulled out and appear elongated, or be pushed in and appear shorter. A displaced tooth can also be pushed forward, backward, sideways, or rotated. The sooner the dentist can splint or realign the tooth with orthodontic brackets and wires, the easier it can be brought back into proper alignment. Trauma significant enough to cause tooth displacement can also lead to pulp injury. As a result, a displaced tooth should be evaluated periodically for several months to determine if a root canal procedure or tooth extraction is needed.' "
Is it possible to prevent dental injuries?,"'Prevention of dental injuries involves aligning protruding front teeth with dental ''braces'' and using face masks and mouthguards while participating in sports. Mouthguards have been shown to reduce trauma not only to teeth, gums, and the surrounding jaw bone but also the temporomandibular joints (''TMJ''). Mouthguards can also reduce the intensity and number of head ''concussions'', as well as reduce pressure and bone deformation of the skull when a force is directed to the chin.''Before the mandatory use of face masks and mouthguards for high school and college football players in 1963, 50% of all football injuries involved the face and the mouth. Since the mandatory use of these protective devices, dental injuries in football players have almost been eliminated. It is now recommended or required that a mouthguard be worn for the following sports: football, baseball, basketball, racquetball, soccer, ice hockey, field hockey, street hockey, wrestling, boxing, martial arts, volleyball, rollerblading, skating, skateboarding, and bicycling.'""Mouthguards can be purchased in pharmacies and sports supply stores and molded at home. They can also be custom made by the dentist. Store-bought mouthguards are usually less expensive than custom-made ones. However, store-bought mouthguards may not fit the athlete's mouth well, become loose, be uncomfortably bulky, and may interfere with speech or ""'breathing''. The ideal mouthguards are custom made by a dentist using a ''mold'"" taken of the athlete's upper dental arch. The custom mouthguard is then fabricated in a lab out of a special ""'plastic'' that conforms comfortable around the teeth and gums. A well-fitting custom mouthguard should be comfortable and not interfere with breathing and speech.' "
Introduction,"""Lasers have been used in dentistry since 1994 to treat a number of dentalproblems. But, despite FDA approval, no laser system has received the AmericanDental Association's Seal of Acceptance. That seal assures dentists that theproduct or device meets ADA standards of safety and efficacy, among otherthings. The ADA, however, states that it is cautiously optimistic about therole of laser technology in the field of dentistry. These lasers are differentfrom the ""'cold'' lasers used in phototherapy for the relief of ''headaches'', ''pain'',and inflammation.''Still, some dentists are using lasers to treat:' Tooth decay. Lasers are used to remove decay within a tooth and prepare the surrounding enamel for receipt of the  filling. 
  Lasers are also used to ""cure"" or harden a filling. Gum disease. Lasers are used to reshape gums and remove bacteria during 
  root canal procedures. Biopsy or lesion removal. Lasers can be used to remove a small piece
of tissue (called a biopsy) so that it can be examined for cancer. Laser are
also used to remove lesions in the mouth; and relieve the pain of canker sores. Teeth whitening. Lasers are used to speed up the in-office teeth whitening procedures. A peroxide
bleaching solution, applied to the tooth surface, is ""activated"" by
laser energy, which speeds up of the whitening process."
How Do Lasers Work?,"'All lasers work by delivering energy in the form of light. When used forsurgical procedures, the laser acts as a cutting instrument or a vaporizer oftissue that it comes in contact with. When used for ""curing"" a filling,the laser helps to strengthen the bond between the filling and the tooth. Whenused in ''teeth'' whitening procedures, the laser acts as a heat source andenhances the effect of tooth beaching agents.' "
What Are the Pros and Cons of Using a Laser?,"'Pros'' Compared to the traditional dental drill, lasers:''Cons'' The disadvantages of lasers are that:''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Reviewed by Jay H.

Lasers can't be used in many commonly performed dental procedures. For
example, lasers can't be used to fill cavities located between teeth, around
old fillings, and large cavities that need to be prepared for a crown. In
addition, lasers cannot be used to remove defective crowns or silver fillings,
or prepare teeth for bridges. Traditional drills may still be needed to shape the filling, adjust the bite, and polish the filling even when a laser is used. Lasers do not eliminate the need for anesthesia. Laser treatment tends to be more expensive since the cost of the laser is
much higher than a dental drill. Lasers can cost between $39,000 and $45,000
compared to about $600 for a standard drill."
What Is Dental Sealants?,"'Sealants are a thin, ''plastic'' coating painted on the chewing surfaces of ''teeth'' -- usually'' the back ''teeth'' (the premolars, and ''molars) -- to'' prevent ''tooth decay''. The painted on liquid sealant quickly bonds into the depressions and grooves of the teeth forming a protective shield over the enamel of each tooth.''Although thorough brushing and flossing can remove food particles and plaque from smooth surfaces of teeth, they cannot always get into all the nooks and crannies of the back teeth to remove the food and plaque. Sealants protect these vulnerable areas from tooth decay by ""sealing out"" plaque and food.' "
Who Should Get Sealants?,"'Because of the likelihood of developing decay in the depressions and groovesof the premolars and molars, children and teenagers are obvious candidates forsealants. However, adults without decay or ''fillings'' in their molars can alsobenefit from sealants.''Typically, children should get sealants on their permanent molars andpremolars as soon as these teeth come in. In this way, the dental sealants canprotect the teeth through the ''cavity''-prone years of ages 6 to 14.''In some cases, dental sealants may also be appropriate for ''baby teeth'"", suchas when a child's baby teeth have deep depressions and grooves. Because babyteeth play such an important role in holding the correct spacing for permanentteeth, it is important to keep these teeth healthy so they are not lost tooearly."" "
How Are Sealants Applied?,"'Applying the sealant is a simple and painless process. It takes only a fewminutes for your dentist or hygienist to apply the sealant to seal each tooth.The application steps are as follows:' First the teeth that are to be sealed are thoroughly cleaned. Each tooth is then dried and cotton or another absorbent material is put
around the tooth to keep it dry. An acid solution is put on the chewing surfaces of the teeth to roughen
them up, which helps the sealant bond to the teeth. The teeth are then rinsed and dried. Sealant is then painted onto the tooth enamel, where it bonds directly to
the tooth and hardens. Sometimes a special curing light is used to help the
sealant harden."
How Long Do Sealants Last?,"'Sealants can protect the teeth from decay for up to 10 years, but they needto be checked for chipping or wearing at regular dental check-ups. Your dentistcan replace sealants as necessary.' "
Does Insurance Cover the Cost of Sealants?,"'Many insurance companies cover the cost of sealants. Check with your dentalinsurance carrier to determine if sealants are covered under your plan.''Reviewed by the doctors at The ClevelandClinic Department of Dentistry.''Edited by \t\t\tCharlotte E. Grayson Mathis, MD, on  May 1, 2005''\t\t\tPortions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic'' 2000-2005' "
Impacted Teeth,"'''Wisdom teeth'', otherwise known as third molars, are the last set of ''teeth'' todevelop. Sometimes these ''teeth'' emerge from the gum line and the jaw is largeenough to allow room for them, but most of the time, this is not the case. Moreoften, one or more of these third molars fails to emerge in proper alignment orfails to fully emerge through the gum line and becomes entrapped or""impacted"" between the jawbone and the gum tissue. Impacted wisdomteeth can result in swelling, ''pain'', and infection of the gum tissue surroundingthe ''wisdom teeth''. In addition, ''impacted wisdom teeth'' can cause permanent damageto nearby teeth, gums, and bone and can sometimes lead to the formation of ''cysts'' or tumors that can destroy sections of the jaw. Therefore, dentistsrecommend people with ''impacted wisdom teeth'' have them surgically removed.'""It's not just wisdom teeth that sometimes become impacted and need to beremoved. Other teeth, such as the cuspids and the bicuspids can become impactedand can cause the same types of problems described with impacted wisdomteeth.""'''' "
Tooth Loss,"'''Dental implants'' are an option for tooth loss due to an accident orinfection or as an alternative to ''dentures''. The implants are tooth root substitutes that are surgicallyanchored in place in the jawbone and act to stabilize the artificial teeth towhich they are attached. Suitable candidates for dental implants need to havean adequate bone level and density, must not be prone to infection, and must bewilling to maintain good oral hygiene practices.' "
Jaw-Related Problems," 
Unequal jaw growth. In some individuals, the upper and lower jaw
fail to grow properly. This can cause difficulty in speaking, eating,
swallowing, and breathing. While some of these problems -- like improper teeth
alignment -- can be corrected with braces and other orthodontic appliances, more
serious problems require oral surgery to move all or part of the upper jaw,
lower jaw, or both into a new position that is more balanced, functional, and
healthy. 
Improve fit of dentures. For first-time denture wearers, oral
surgery can be done to correct any irregularities of the jaws prior to creating
the dentures to ensure a better fit. Oral surgery can also help long-term
denture wearers. Supporting bone often deteriorates over time resulting in
dentures that no longer fit properly. In severe cases, an oral surgeon can add
a bone graft to areas where little bone remains. 
Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. Dysfunction of the 
TMJ, the small joint in front of the ear where the skull and lower jaw
meet, is a common source of headache and facial pain. Most patients with TMJ
disorders can be successfully treated with a combination of oral medications,
physical therapy, and splints. However, joint surgery is an option for advanced
cases and when the diagnosis indicates a specific problem in the joint."
Other Conditions Treated by Oral Surgery,"'Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Edited by Charlotte E. Grayson, MD, on May 1, 2005.''Portions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic'' 2000-2005' 
Facial injury repair. Oral surgery is often used to fix fractured
jaws and broken facial bones. 
Lesion removal and biopsy. Oral surgeons can take a small sample of
abnormal growth or tissue and then send it for laboratory testing for
identification. Some lesions can be managed medically or can be removed by the
oral surgeon. 
Cleft lip and cleft palate repair. Cleft lip and cleft palate result when all or portions of the mouth and nasal cavity do
not grow together properly during fetal development. The result is a gap in the
lip and/or a split in the opening in the roof of the mouth. Oral surgeons work
as part of a team of healthcare specialists to correct these problems through a
series of treatments and surgical procedures over many years. 
Facial infections. Pain and swelling in the face, neck or jaws may
indicate an infection. Infections in this area of the body can sometimes
develop into life-threatening emergencies if not treated promptly and
effectively. An oral surgeon can assist in diagnosing and treating this
problem. Surgical treatment, if needed, may include cutting into and draining
the infected area as well as extracting any teeth that might be involved. 
Snoring/sleep apnea. When conservative methods fail to alleviate
this problem, surgery can be tried. Surgical procedures involve removing the
soft tissues of the oropharynx (an area in the back portion of the mouth) or
the lower jaw. Laser surgery is a newer treatment option. Depending on the
surgical technique used, the laser is used to either slowly scar the palate,
which tightens it, or to remove palate tissue."
What are common causes of dental injuries?,"'Trauma'' to the face or ''teeth'' can be caused by auto accidents, falls, and injury from a variety of sports, such as football, hockey, soccer, volleyball, basketball, and baseball. Patients suffering significant head, neck, or facial trauma should be evaluated and treated in a hospital emergency room setting. Such trauma may involve bleeding from the nose or ears, ''concussion'', ''dizziness'', lapse of memory, disorientation, severe ''headache'', ''earache'', or breaking (fracture) of the skull and/or jaws. Most hospitals have on staff oral surgeons who can treat ''fractures'' of the upper or lower jaw and perform emergency tooth removal (dental extractions) and reconstruction of the dental arches.''Wear and tear due to ''cavities'' and chewing or biting down on hard objects, such as pencils, ice cubes, nuts, and hard candies, can also lead to tooth fractures. Dental injury without associated head and neck trauma can usually be evaluated and treated in a dental office. Such dental injuries include broken teeth (fractured teeth), teeth totally knocked out of the mouth, or teeth displaced by unexpected external forces. These dental injuries include swelling of the gum and oral tissue. ''Cold'' packs or ice cubes placed inside the mouth over the injured tooth or outside on the cheeks or lips can reduce ''pain'' and swelling before the patient reaches the dentist.' "
How is a tooth fracture treated?,"'Tooth fractures can range from minor (involving chipping of the outer tooth layers called enamel and dentin) to severe (involving vertical, diagonal, or horizontal fractures of the tooth and/or root). Enamel and dentin are the two outer protective layers of the tooth. The enamel is the outermost white hard surface. The dentin is a yellow layer lying just beneath the enamel. Enamel and dentin both serve to protect the inner living tooth tissue called the pulp. The portion of the tooth that is visible in the mouth is called the crown and is only a part of the entire tooth structure. The remaining portion of the tooth is buried in the bone and is called the root. Different tests are performed in the mouth to determine if a tooth fracture is present. In some instances, ''dental X-rays'' can help to diagnose, locate, and measure the extent of tooth fractures.'  "
What are treatment options for a serious tooth fracture?,"'A serious fracture is one that exposes both the dentin and the pulp tissue and should be treated promptly. Serious fractures may make the tooth displaced and loose, and cause the gums to bleed. To prevent the loose tooth from falling out completely, the dentist can splint the loose tooth by bonding it to the adjacent teeth to help stabilize it while the underlying bone and gums heal. Because of the high risk of pulp infection after the exposure of the pulp to the oral environment, a ''root canal'' procedure may need to be performed during the first visit. Alternatively, the dentist may elect to only apply a sedative dressing on the splinted tooth to help calm the ''tooth pain''. The tooth will then be reevaluated in two to four weeks to determine if a root canal procedure is necessary. If the tooth appears to have recovered and is stable in the mouth, the splint is removed at that time and a filling or crown is placed to restore the fractured tooth. The tooth may still require periodic monitoring over time (months to a year) to determine if any further treatment will be needed.''The most serious injuries involve vertical, diagonal, or horizontal fractures of the tooth roots. In most instances, a fracture of the tooth root leaves the injured tooth very loose and unable to be restored with dental work, thus necessitating tooth extraction. The extracted tooth is often replaced with a removable plate containing a false tooth as a temporary measure until a more definite plan for tooth replacement is made. There are some specific instances where teeth with horizontal fractures near the tip of the root may not need extraction. Root canal treatment for the injured tooth may be required in the future if symptoms of pulp death and tooth infection appear. Periodic dental ''X-rays'' of the fractured tooth are performed to monitor it closely.' "
What is the treatment for a chipped tooth?,"'A minor tooth fracture usually involves chipping of the enamel only. The tooth is not displaced out of its position and there is no bleeding from the gums. The only symptom of such minor chipping may be sharp or rough tooth edges that irritate the cheek and tongue. The injured tooth itself may not be painful or sensitive to food or temperature. The risk of pulp injury is low and treatment is usually not considered urgent. A small amount of orthodontic wax or sugarless gum can be placed over the rough edge until the dentist can be seen. Depending on the amount of enamel lost, definitive treatment usually involves placing a dental filling or a crown to restore the tooth to normal contour.' "
How is a fracture of the enamel and dentin treated?,"'A deeper fracture can involve both the enamel and the dentin of a tooth. Even though a deep fracture is present, the tooth may not be displaced or out of position and the gums may not be bleeding. These deeper fractures may be sensitive to changes in temperature, chewing, or biting. Prolonged exposure of dentin leaves the tooth vulnerable to decay that can advance rapidly. Therefore, fractures involving the dentin are treated promptly. Treatment involves placing a dental filling or a crown. Unless there are continuing symptoms of ''pain'', the tooth can be monitored with routine dental X-rays to ensure that the tooth is healthy.'""If a fracture has significantly injured the pulp, then treatment involves either extraction of the tooth or root canal treatment. Extraction is indicated if the tooth has been significantly weakened by the fracture and its form and function cannot be properly restored. If the tooth's form and function can be restored, root canal treatment is performed to prevent infection. This procedure involves removing all the dying pulp tissue and replacing it with an inert material in order to keep infection out. Once the root canal treatment is complete, the tooth can be restored with a filling or crown."" "
What are first aid tips for knocked out teeth?,"'The upper front permanent teeth are the most common teeth to be completely knocked out (""avulsed""). Primary (baby) teeth that are knocked out from injury are usually not reimplanted into the mouth since they will be replaced naturally by permanent teeth later.''In the event of having a permanent tooth knocked out, care should be taken to handle the tooth only by its crown (chewing surface) and not by its root, gently rinsed in clean water or milk and placed back (reimplanted) into the socket from where it came. This can be done by the patient or parent and then checked by the dentist. If the parent or patient is unsure about reimplanting the tooth, then the tooth should be stored in milk or an emergency tooth preservation solution and brought to the dentist as soon as possible. Alternatively, in older children and adults who are calm, the tooth may be held within the cheeks inside of the mouth while traveling to the dental office. Unfortunately, water is not considered a good storage medium for a tooth for long periods of time. The most important variable affecting the success of reimplantation is the amount of time that the tooth is out of its socket. Teeth reimplanted within one hour of the accident frequently reattach to their teeth sockets.''After reimplanting the tooth into its original socket, the dentist can then splint this tooth to adjacent teeth for two to eight weeks. Splinting helps to stabilize the tooth while the bone and tissue around it heals. During the splinting period, the patient should eat soft foods, avoid biting on the splinted teeth, and brush all the other teeth diligently to keep the mouth as clean as possible.''In adults, the reimplanted tooth should have a root canal procedure within seven to 10 days. Reimplanted permanent teeth in children (where the tooth root has not yet completely formed) may not need a root canal procedure. These teeth should be observed for at least five years for signs and symptoms such as pain, discoloration, gum abscess, or abscess visible on a dental X-ray, which could indicate a dying pulp.''In most patients who have had tooth reimplantation, ''over-the-counter'' medications like ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') are sufficient for pain relief. Since the splinted teeth cannot be brushed normally and the splint usually collects extra dental plaque and food debris, chlorhexidine gluconate (''Peridex'') mouth rinse may be prescribed to prevent and control gum inflammation (''gingivitis''). Oral antibiotics and a ''tetanus'' toxoid injection are considered for patients with accompanying significant soft-tissue ''cuts'' (lacerations).' "
What is the treatment for a displaced tooth?,"'Instead of being completely knocked out of the mouth, a tooth can be displaced into another position. In the mouth, a displaced tooth may be pulled out and appear elongated, or be pushed in and appear shorter. A displaced tooth can also be pushed forward, backward, sideways, or rotated. The sooner the dentist can splint or realign the tooth with orthodontic brackets and wires, the easier it can be brought back into proper alignment. Trauma significant enough to cause tooth displacement can also lead to pulp injury. As a result, a displaced tooth should be evaluated periodically for several months to determine if a root canal procedure or tooth extraction is needed.' "
Is it possible to prevent dental injuries?,"'Prevention of dental injuries involves aligning protruding front teeth with dental ''braces'' and using face masks and mouthguards while participating in sports. Mouthguards have been shown to reduce trauma not only to teeth, gums, and the surrounding jaw bone but also the temporomandibular joints (''TMJ''). Mouthguards can also reduce the intensity and number of head ''concussions'', as well as reduce pressure and bone deformation of the skull when a force is directed to the chin.''Before the mandatory use of face masks and mouthguards for high school and college football players in 1963, 50% of all football injuries involved the face and the mouth. Since the mandatory use of these protective devices, dental injuries in football players have almost been eliminated. It is now recommended or required that a mouthguard be worn for the following sports: football, baseball, basketball, racquetball, soccer, ice hockey, field hockey, street hockey, wrestling, boxing, martial arts, volleyball, rollerblading, skating, skateboarding, and bicycling.'""Mouthguards can be purchased in pharmacies and sports supply stores and molded at home. They can also be custom made by the dentist. Store-bought mouthguards are usually less expensive than custom-made ones. However, store-bought mouthguards may not fit the athlete's mouth well, become loose, be uncomfortably bulky, and may interfere with speech or ""'breathing''. The ideal mouthguards are custom made by a dentist using a ''mold'"" taken of the athlete's upper dental arch. The custom mouthguard is then fabricated in a lab out of a special ""'plastic'' that conforms comfortable around the teeth and gums. A well-fitting custom mouthguard should be comfortable and not interfere with breathing and speech.' "
Dental Veneers Fix Introduction,'Dental veneers'' can be made from porcelain or from resin composite materials. Porcelain veneers resist stains better than resin veneers and better mimic the light reflecting properties of natural teeth. Resin veneers are thinner and require removal of less of the tooth surface before placement. You will need to discuss the best choice of veneer material for you with your dentist.' 
What Types of Problems Do Dental Veneers Fix?," Teeth that are worn down Teeth that are chipped or broken Teeth that are misaligned, uneven, or irregularly shaped (for example, have craters or bulges in them) Teeth with gaps between them (to close the space between these teeth)"
What Is the Procedure for Getting a Dental Veneer?," Diagnosis and treatment planning. This first step involves active participation between you and your dentist. Explain to your dentist the result that you are trying to achieve. During this appointment your dentist will examine your teeth to make sure dental veneers are appropriate for you and discuss what the procedure will involve and some of its limitations. He or she also may take x-rays and possibly make impressions of your mouth and teeth. Preparation. To prepare a tooth for a veneer, your dentist will remove about ½ millimeter of enamel from the tooth surface, which is an amount nearly equal to the thickness of the veneer to be added to the tooth surface. Before trimming off the enamel, you and your dentist will decide the need for a local anesthetic to numb the area. Next, your dentist will make a model or impression of your tooth. This model is sent out to a dental laboratory, which in turn constructs your veneer. It usually takes 1 to 2 weeks for your dentist to receive the veneers back from the laboratory. For very unsightly teeth, temporary dental veneers can be placed for an additional cost. Bonding . Before the dental veneer is permanently cemented to your tooth, your dentist will temporarily place it on your tooth to examine its fit and color. He or she will repeatedly remove and trim the veneer as needed to achieve the proper fit; the veneer color can be adjusted with the shade of cement to be used. Next, to prepare your tooth to receive the veneer, your tooth will be cleaned, polished and etched ? which roughens the tooth to allow for a strong bonding process. A special cement is applied to the veneer and the veneer is then placed on your tooth. Once properly position on the tooth, your dentist will apply a special light beam to the dental veneer, which activates chemicals in the cement causing it to harden or cure very quickly. The final steps involve removing any excess cement, evaluating your bite and making any final adjustments in the veneer as necessary. Your dentist may ask you to return for a follow-up visit in a couple of weeks to check how your gums are responding to the presence of your veneer and to once again examine the veneer's placement."
What Are the Advantages of Dental Veneers?," They provide a natural tooth appearance. Gum tissue tolerates porcelain well. Porcelain veneers are stain resistant. The color of a porcelain veneer can be selected such that it makes dark teeth appear whiter. Veneers offer a conservative approach to changing a tooth's color and shape-veneers generally don't require the extensive shaping prior to the procedure that crowns do, yet offer a stronger, more esthetic alternative to bonding."
What Are the Disadvantages of Dental Veneers?," The process is not reversible. Veneers are more costly than composite resin bonding. Veneers are usually not repairable should they chip or crack. Because enamel has been removed, your tooth may become more sensitive to hot and cold foods and beverages. Veneers may not exactly match the color of your other teeth. Also, the veneer's color cannot be altered once in place. If you plan on whitening your teeth, you need to do so before getting veneers. Though not likely, veneers can dislodge and fall off. To minimize the chance of this occurring, do not bite your nails; chew on pencils, ice, or other hard objects; or otherwise put pressure on your teeth. Teeth with veneers can still experience decay, possibly necessitating full coverage of the tooth with a crown. Veneers are not a good choice for individuals with unhealthy teeth (for example, those with decay or active periodontal disease), weakened teeth (as a result of decay, fracture, large dental fillings) or by those who had an inadequate amount of existing enamel on the tooth surface. Individuals who clench and grind their teeth are poor candidates for porcelain veneers, as these activities can cause the veneers to crack or chip."

Types of Intraoral X-Rays,"'There are several types of intraoral X-rays, each of which shows differentaspects of teeth.' 
Bite-wing X-rays show details of the upper and lower teeth
in one area of the mouth. Each bite-wing shows a tooth from its crown to about
the level of the supporting bone. Bite-wing X-rays are used to detect decay
between teeth and changes in bone density caused by gum disease. They are also
useful in determining the proper fit of a crown (or cast restoration) and the marginal integrity of fillings. 
Periapical X-rays show the whole tooth -- from the crown
to beyond the end of the root to where the tooth is anchored in the jaw. Each
periapical X-ray shows this full tooth dimension and includes all the teeth in
one portion of either the upper or lower jaw. Periapical X-rays are used to
detect any abnormalities of the root structure and surrounding bone
structure. 
Occlusal X-rays are larger and show full tooth development
and placement. Each X-ray reveals the entire arch of teeth in either the upper
or lower jaw."
Types of Extraoral X-Rays,"'There are several types of extraoral X-rays that your dentist may wish totake.' 
Panoramic X-rays show the entire mouth area -- all the
teeth in both the upper and lower jaws -- on a single X-ray. This type of X-ray
is useful for detecting the position of fully emerged as well as emerging
teeth, can identify impacted teeth and aid in the diagnosis of tumors. 
Tomograms show a particular layer or ""slice"" of
the mouth while blurring out all other layers. This type of X-ray is useful for
examining structures that are difficult to clearly see -- for instance, because
other structures are in very close proximity to the structure to be
viewed. 
Cephalometric projections show the entire side of the
head. This type of X-ray is useful for examining the teeth in relation to the
jaw and profile of the individual. Orthodontists use this type of X-ray to
develop their treatment plans. 
Sialography involves visualization of the salivary glands
following the injection of a dye. The dye, called a radiopaque contrast agent,
is injected into the salivary glands so that the organ can be seen on the X-ray
film (the organ is a soft tissue that would not otherwise be seen with an
X-ray). Dentists might order this type of test to look for salivary gland
problems, such as blockages or Sjogren's syndrome. 
Computed tomography, otherwise known as CT scanning, shows
the body's interior structures as a three-dimensional image. This type of
X-ray, which is performed in a hospital rather than a dentist's office, is used
to identify problems in the bones of the face, such as tumors or
fractures."
In the Pipeline,"""There's a newer X-ray technique that your dentist already may be using ormay soon be using. It's called digital imaging. Instead of developing X-rayfilm in a dark room, the X-rays are sent directly to a computer and can beviewed on screen, stored, or printed out. There are several nice benefits ofusing this new technology including:""'Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''    Reviewed by Jay H. Rosoff, DDS, on March 1, 2007''Edited by Charlotte E. Grayson Mathis, MD, on May 1, 2005''Portions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic'' 2000-2005' The technique uses less radiation than the typical X-ray and there is no
wait time for the X-rays to develop -- the images are available on screen a few
seconds after being taken. The image taken, of a tooth for example, can be enhanced and enlarged many
times it's actual size on the computer screen, making it easier for your
dentist to show you where and what the problem is. If necessary, images can be electronically sent to another dentist or
specialist -- for instance, for a second opinion on a dental problem -- to
determine if a specialist is needed, or to a new dentist (if you move). Software added to the computer can help dentists digitally compare current
to previous images in a process called subtraction radiography. Using this
technique, everything that is the same between two images is ""subtracted
out"" from the image leaving a clear image of only the portion that is
different. This helps dentists easily see the tiniest changes that may not have
been noticed by the naked eye."
What Types of Problems Can X-Rays Detect?,"'In adults, X-ray films can be used to:''In children, dental X-ray films are used to:' Show areas of decay that may not be visible with an oral examination,
especially small areas of decay between teeth Identify decay occurring beneath an existing filling Reveal bone loss that accompanies gum disease Reveal changes in the bone or in the root canal resulting from
infection Assist in the preparation of tooth implants, braces, dentures, or other
dental procedures Reveal abscesses (an infection at the root of a tooth or between the gum
and a tooth) Reveal other developmental abnormalities, such as cysts and some types of
tumors Watch for decay Determine if there is enough space in the mouth to fit all incoming
teeth Determine if primary teeth are being lost quickly enough to allow permanent
teeth to erupt properly Check for the development of 
 wisdom teeth and identify if the teeth are impacted (unable to emerge
through the gums)"
How Often Should Teeth Be X-Rayed?,"'The frequency of getting X-rays often depends on your medical and dentalhistory and current condition. Some people may need X-rays as often as everysix months; others with no recent dental or gum disease and who visit theirdentist regularly may get X-rays only every couple of years. If you are a newpatient, your dentist may take X-rays as part of the initial examination and toestablish a baseline record from which to compare changes that may occur overtime.''Some general guidelines your dentist may follow regarding the frequency of''dental X-rays'' is as follows:''People who fall into the high risk category who may need X-ray films takenmore frequently include:' 
Children. Children generally need more X-rays than adults
because their teeth and jaws are still developing and because their teeth are
more likely to be affected by tooth decay. 
Adults with extensive restorative work, such as fillings
to look for decay beneath existing fillings or in new locations. 
People who drink a lot of sugary beverages to look for
tooth decay (since the sugary environment creates a perfect situation for
cavities to develop). 
People with periodontal (gum) disease to monitor bone
loss. 
People who have dry mouth whether due to medications (such
as antidepressants, antianxiety drugs, antihistamines, and others) or disease
states (such as Sjogren's syndrome, damaged salivary glands, radiation
treatment to head and neck). Dry mouth conditions can lead to the development of cavities. 
Smokers to monitor bone loss resulting from periodontal disease (smokers are at increased risk of periodontal
disease)."
How Safe Are X-Rays?,"'Exposure to all sources of ''radiation -- including'' the sun, ''minerals'' in thesoil, appliances in your home, and dental ''X-rays -- can'"" damage the body'stissues and cells and can lead to the development of ""'cancer'' in some instances.Fortunately, the dose of radiation you are exposed to during the taking ofdental X-rays is extremely small.''Advances in dentistry over the years have lead to a number of measures thatwill minimize the risks associated with X-rays.

What are dentures?," When a person is missing teeth, he or she may experience a variety of problems. The person may become less confident in their smile and have difficulty speaking and eating certain foods. Dentures are appliances that are custom made to replace a person's missing teeth and restore the appearance and oral functions that were lost. The denture can be either a full denture or a partial denture. A full denture is used when all of the person's teeth are missing and a partial denture is used when only some of the teeth are missing."
What are the different types of dentures?,"'Complete Dentures:'' Complete dentures are made of a ''plastic'' base that is colored in order to replicate gum tissue and supports a full set of plastic or porcelain teeth. The traditional full denture is held in the mouth by forming a seal with the gums. They can also be held in place by attaching to ''dental implants'' that are surgically placed in the bone of the jaws. This treatment is much more expensive than the traditional complete denture.''Partial Dentures:'' Partial dentures can either be made with a plastic base or a metal framework that supports the number of teeth that need to be replaced. It is held in the mouth by using clasps and rests that are carefully adapted around the natural teeth. The partial denture that uses a metal framework is the traditional design, due to the rigidity and strength of the metal.  Plastic partial dentures have normally been used as emergency or temporary replacements of missing teeth, allowing the gums and bone to heal before a definitive restorative solution is obtained. Recently, however, various materials such as Valplast have been developed to provide durable, flexible alternatives in certain situations.'  "
How are dentures made?,"'After a tooth is extracted or lost, the tooth socket starts to fill in with bone and the gum tissue heals and changes shape. This process takes a few months until the gums and bone reach a stable shape. After this time a conventional full denture is made, preferably about 8 to 12 weeks after the teeth were extracted or lost from the mouth. '""The process starts by taking a series of impressions or molds of the oral tissues that will support the denture. A dental lab will use these impressions to make models of the patient's mouth. The dentist and laboratory technician will then slowly start building the dentures on these models and transferring them to the patient's mouth at each step to ensure proper fit, establish a proper bite, and ensure that the appearance and esthetics of the denture are desirable. The patient will generally need to be seen by the dentist once per week for about 4 to 5 weeks until the denture is complete. The patient will then need to return occasionally during the first month after the denture is delivered to have adjustments made.""""An immediate denture can often be made so that the patient has something to wear the same day the teeth are removed. This type of denture is made before the teeth are extracted and is put in  place the day the teeth are removed. Sometimes the back teeth are taken out first and the front teeth are left in place until the day the denture is delivered. This type of denture doesn't fit the bone and gum tissue as intimately as a conventional denture, so it requires more adjustments during the healing stage. An immediate denture is best used as a temporary appliance until a conventional denture can be made after all of the gum and bone healing is complete."" "
Are there alternatives to dentures?,"'There are two other ways missing teeth can be replaced -- with ''bridges'' and implants.''Bridges:'' A ''bridge'' replaces missing teeth by placing crowns on the teeth next to the space and attaching a fake tooth to both of the crowns. Bridges are made from gold, porcelain fused to gold, all porcelain, or zirconium. Bridges can only replace about two to three missing teeth in a row, depending on the location. Since bridges are cemented in place, they are considered a ""fixed, or permanent denture.""''Implants:'' An implant is a metal post that is inserted into the bone of the upper or lower jaw. This post is then used to replace a single tooth by attaching a ''crown'' to it, or multiple teeth by attaching a bridge to multiple implants. Implants are the most expensive option for tooth replacement, but implants simulate natural teeth better than any of the other options.' "
"Will dentures affect the way of a person looks, feels, eats, and speaks?","""Dentures can restore or even enhance a person's appearance and be virtually undetectable. It takes some time to find the best way to insert and take out the dentures, and the gums will be a little sore in places at first. It is very important to return to the dentist often during the first few weeks to adjust the parts of the denture that are irritating the oral tissues. ""'Eating with the dentures in place requires some practice. It is best to start with soft foods, chewing food equally on both sides of the mouth and slowly introducing more solid foods. Chewy or sticky foods should be avoided. Once the cheeks and tongue get used to the denture, they will begin to automatically help keep the denture in place.  ''Speaking also requires practice but will become easier with repetition. With exaggerated movements such as yawning or laughing, the denture may become dislodged at first. If it continues, the denture may need to be adjusted or relined (refit). The denture may cause an increased production of saliva at first, but it will reduce back to normal.  '  "
Are dentures worn all day?,"'Dentures are generally worn during the day and taken out at night to give the oral tissues time to relax. During the first few days after receiving the denture, however, it needs to remain in the mouth even when sleeping to best identify areas that need to be adjusted. This is especially important after receiving an immediate denture, for the gum tissues will swell after the teeth are extracted or lost and then may not permit the denture to be reinserted if taken out.' "
How do you clean and care for dentures?,"'Dentures must be handled with great care and placed in a container of water or denture cleaner when not being worn. They should never be placed in hot water, for they can be damaged or warped. They must be cleaned daily using a soft ''toothbrush'' with soap and water. The mouth should be rinsed daily without the dentures in place to clean off any plaque and reduce the risk of infection like ''candidiasis''.''There are a lot of different denture products that can be purchased at any drugstore to help with caring for and cleaning dentures.' "
Should I use denture adhesive?,"""Denture adhesive is a paste or glue that helps the denture adhere to the supporting tissues instead of relying on suction or clasps. Sometimes the adhesive is called denture cream. A small amount of denture adhesive can be applied evenly to the clean surface of a denture to enhance stability and retention. It shouldn't be used to compensate for a poor-fitting denture or as an alternative to visiting the dentist for regular checkups."" "
Are dentures affordable? How much do dentures cost?,'Denture prices vary widely depending on the materials used. One can expect to pay at least a couple thousand dollars for a set of dentures.'  
Does dental insurance cover the cost of dentures?,"'Most dental insurance companies cover some or all of the cost of dentures, making them very affordable. The insurance company should be contacted to determine the exact amount of coverage.' "
How long do dentures last?,"'If cared for properly, dentures should last a minimum of 5 years. Over time, the bone shrinks and causes the denture to become loose. The rate that this happens varies with each individual, but can be controlled by visiting a dentist regularly to ensure that the denture is fitting properly.  An ill-fitting denture causes the bone to shrink more rapidly. To prolong the life of a denture, a dentist will often use a denture liner to refit the internal surface of the denture to the oral tissues.''Minor ''fractures'' in the teeth or acrylic base can usually be repaired by a dental lab in 1 to 2 days. Denture repair kits are even sold at most drugstores and online to fix minor cracks or replace loose teeth. Repairing the denture properly can be complicated, however, so if denture problems are noticed, it is best to contact a general dentist as soon as possible to arrange the denture repair.' "
What is a depressive disorder? Depression vs. sadness,"'Depressive disorders are mood disorders that have been with mankind since the beginning of recorded history. In the Bible, King David, as well as Job, suffered from this affliction. Hippocrates referred to depression as melancholia, which literally means black bile. Black bile, along with blood, ''phlegm'', and yellow bile were the four humors (fluids) that described the basic medical physiology theory of that time. Literature and the arts have portrayed depression, also referred to as ''clinical depression'', for hundreds of years, but what do we mean today when we refer to a depressive disorder? In the 19th century, people thought of depression as an ''inherited'' weakness of temperament. In the first half of the 20th century, Freud linked the development of depression to guilt and conflict. John Cheever, the author and a modern sufferer of depressive disorder, wrote of conflict and experiences with his parents as influencing his becoming clinically ''depressed''.'""In the 1950s and '60s, health care professionals divided depression into two types, endogenous and neurotic. Endogenous means that the depression comes from within the body, perhaps of genetic origin, or comes out of nowhere. Neurotic or reactive depression has a clear environmental precipitating factor, such as the death of a spouse, or other significant loss, such as the loss of a job. In the 1970s and '80s, the focus of attention shifted from the cause of depression to its effects on the afflicted people. That is to say, whatever the cause in a particular case, what are the symptoms and impaired functions that experts can agree make up a depressive illness? Although experts sometimes dispute these issues, most agree on the following:"" A depressive disorder is a syndrome (group of symptoms) characterized by sad and/or irritable mood exceeding normal sadness or grief. More specifically, the sadness of depression is characterized by a greater intensity and duration and by more severe symptoms and functional problems than is normal. Depressive signs and symptoms not only include negative thoughts, moods, and behaviors but also by specific changes in bodily functions (for example, excessive crying spells, body aches, low energy or libido, as well as problems with eating, weight, or sleeping). Neurovegetative signs are the changes in functioning associated with clinical depression. This means that the nervous system changes in the brain are thought to cause many physical symptoms that result in a decreased or increased activity level and other problems with functioning. People with certain depressive disorders, especially bipolar depression (manic depression), seem to have an inherited vulnerability to this condition. Depressive illnesses are a huge public health problem, due to its affecting millions of people. Facts about depression include that about 10% of adults, up to 8% of teens, and 2% of preteen children experience some kind of depressive disorder. Postpartum depression is the most common mental health disorder to afflict women after childbirth.The statistics on the costs due to depression in the United States include huge amounts of direct costs, which are for treatment, and indirect costs, such as lost productivity and absenteeism from work or school.Adolescents who suffer from depression are at risk for developing and maintaining obesity.In a major medical study, depression caused significant problems in the functioning (morbidity) of those affected more often than did arthritis, hypertension, 
	chronic lung disease, diabetes, and in some ways as often as coronary artery disease.Depression can increase the risks for developing coronary artery disease and asthma, contracting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and many other medical illnesses. Other complications of depression include its tendency to increase the morbidity (illness/negative health effects) and mortality (death) from these and many other medical conditions.Depression can coexist with virtually every other mental health condition, aggravating the status of those who suffer the combination of both depression and the other mental illness.Depression in the elderly tends to be chronic, has a low rate of recovery, and is often undertreated. This is of particular concern given that elderly men, particularly elderly white men have the highest suicide rate. The statistics on the costs due to depression in the United States include huge amounts of direct costs, which are for treatment, and indirect costs, such as lost productivity and absenteeism from work or school. Adolescents who suffer from depression are at risk for developing and maintaining obesity. In a major medical study, depression caused significant problems in the functioning (morbidity) of those affected more often than did arthritis, hypertension, 
	chronic lung disease, diabetes, and in some ways as often as coronary artery disease. Depression can increase the risks for developing coronary artery disease and asthma, contracting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and many other medical illnesses. Other complications of depression include its tendency to increase the morbidity (illness/negative health effects) and mortality (death) from these and many other medical conditions. Depression can coexist with virtually every other mental health condition, aggravating the status of those who suffer the combination of both depression and the other mental illness. Depression in the elderly tends to be chronic, has a low rate of recovery, and is often undertreated. This is of particular concern given that elderly men, particularly elderly white men have the highest suicide rate. Depression is usually first identified in a primary care setting, not in a mental health professional's office. Moreover, it often assumes various disguises, which causes depression to be frequently underdiagnosed. In spite of clear research evidence and clinical guidelines regarding treatment, depression is often undertreated. Hopefully, this situation can change for the better. For full recovery from a mood disorder, regardless of whether there is a precipitating factor or it seems to come out of the blue, treatment with medication, phototherapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and/or transcranial magnetic stimulation, (see discussion below) as well as psychotherapy 
	and/or participation in a support group is necessary."
What are myths about depression?,"'The following are myths about depression and its treatment.' It is a weakness rather than an illness. If the 
	depression sufferer just tries hard enough, it will go away without 
	treatment. If you ignore depression in yourself or a loved one, it will go away. Highly intelligent or highly accomplished people do not get depressed. Poor people do not get depressed. Minorities do not get depressed. People with developmental disabilities do not get depressed. People with depression are ""crazy."" Depression does not really exist. Children, teens, the elderly, or men do not get depressed. Depression cannot look like (present as) irritability. The symptoms of depression are the same for everyone who gets the illness.   People who tell someone they are thinking about committing suicide are only trying to get attention and would never do it, especially if they have talked about it before. People with depression cannot have another mental or medical condition at the same time. Psychiatric medications are all addicting. Psychiatric medications do not work; any improvement felt is in the sufferer's imagination. Psychiatric medications are never necessary to treat depression. Medication is the only effective treatment for depression. People should 
	never give children and teens
	antidepressant medication."
"What are the types of depression, and what are depression symptoms and signs?","'Depressive disorders are mood disorders that come in different forms, just as do other illnesses, such as ''heart disease'' and ''diabetes''. However, remember that within each of these types, there are variations in the number, timing, severity, and persistence of symptoms. There are sometimes also differences in how individuals express and/or experience depression based on age, gender, and culture.''The pattern of symptoms may fit a pattern within any type of depression. For example, a person who suffers from persistent depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, ''bipolar disorder'', or any other illness that includes depression can have prominently anxious, melancholic, mixed, psychotic, or atypical features. Such features can have a significant impact on the approach to treatment that may be most effective. For example, for the person whose depression includes prominent ''anxiety'"", a focus of treatment is more likely to be effective if the sufferer's pattern of repeatedly going over thoughts is a major focus of treatment, versus an individual with melancholic features, who may need more intensive support in the morning when the intensity of depression tends to be worse, or versus a person with atypical features, whose tendency toward ""'weight gain'' and excessive sleeping may require nutritional counseling to address dietary issues.''Major depression'', also often referred to as unipolar depression, is characterized by a combination of symptoms that lasts for at least two weeks in a row, including depressed and/or irritable mood (see symptom list), that interferes with the ability to work, ''sleep'', eat, and enjoy once-pleasurable activities. Difficulties in sleeping or eating can take the form of excessive or insufficient of either behavior. Disabling episodes of depression can occur once, twice, or several times in a lifetime.''Persistent depressive disorder, formerly referred to as ''dysthymia'', is a less severe but usually more long-lasting type of depression (dysphoric) compared to major depression. It involves long-term (chronic) symptoms that do not disable but prevent the affected person from functioning at ""full steam"" or from feeling good. Sometimes, people with persistent depressive disorder also experience episodes of major depression. Double-depression is the name for this combination of the two types of depression.''Another type of depression is ''bipolar disorder'', which encompasses a group of mood disorders formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression. These conditions often show a particular pattern of inheritance. Not nearly as common as the other types of depressive illnesses, bipolar disorders involve cycles of mood that include at least one episode of ''mania'' or ''hypomania'' and may include episodes of depression, as well. Bipolar disorders are often chronic and recurring. Sometimes, the mood switches are dramatic and rapid, but most often they are gradual, in that they usually take place over several days, weeks, or longer.''When in the depressed cycle, the person can experience any or all of the symptoms of a depressive condition. When in the manic cycle, any or all of the symptoms listed later in this article under mania may be experienced. Mania often affects thinking, judgment, and social behavior in ways that cause serious problems and embarrassment. For example, indiscriminate or otherwise unsafe sexual practices or unwise business or financial decisions may be made when an individual is in a manic phase.''Bipolar II disorder'' is a significant variant of the bipolar disorders. (The usual form of ''bipolar disorder'' is referred to as ''bipolar I disorder''.) Bipolar II disorder is a syndrome in which the affected person has repeated ''depressive episodes'' punctuated by hypomania (mini-highs). These euphoric states in bipolar II do not completely meet the criteria for the full manic episodes that occur in bipolar I.''Not everyone who is depressed or manic experiences every symptom. Some people suffer from a few symptoms and some many symptoms. The severity of symptoms also varies with individuals. Less severe symptoms that precede the more debilitating symptoms are often called warning signs.' Persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, anger, irritability, discontent, or ""emptiness"" Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism Feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, or excessive guilt Loss of interest or inability to feel pleasure in hobbies and activities that individuals once enjoyed, including sex Apathy/lack of motivation Social isolation, meaning the sufferer avoids interactions with family or friends Sleep changes, like insomnia, early morning awakening, restless sleep, excess sleepiness, or oversleeping Appetite changes, like loss of appetite and/or weight, or excessive hunger, overeating, and/or weight gain Fatigue/tiredness, decreased energy levels, slowness in activity or thought Crying spells Thoughts of death or suicide, suicide attempts Restlessness, agitation, irritability Inability to concentrate, remember things, make decisions, or to handle responsibilities Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as repeated headaches, digestive disorders, and/or chronic pain Inappropriate or excessive elation/expansive mood Inappropriate or excessive irritability or anger Severe insomnia or decreased need to sleep Grandiose notions, like having special powers or importance Increased talking speed and/or volume Disconnected/tangential thoughts or speech Racing thoughts Severely increased sexual desire and/or activity Markedly increased energy Poor judgment Inappropriate social behavior"
Depression symptoms and signs in men,"'Compared to women, men with depression are more likely to experience low energy, irritability, and anger, sometimes to the point of inflicting ''pain'' on others. Men with depression are also more likely to exhibit ''sleep problems'', a loss of interest in work or hobbies, and ''substance abuse''. They may work excessively and engage in more risky behaviors when struggling with depression, committing suicide four times as often as women with this condition. Despite these difficulties, men tend to be much less likely to receive treatment for any condition, particularly depression.' "
Depression symptoms and signs in women,"'In comparison to men, women tend to develop depression at an earlier age and have depressive episodes that last longer and tend to recur more often. Women may more often have a seasonal pattern to depression, as well as symptoms of atypical depression (for example, eating or sleeping too much, carbohydrate craving, weight gain, a heavy feeling in the arms and legs, mood worsening in the evenings, and trouble getting to sleep). Also, women with depression more often have ''anxiety'', ''eating disorders'', and dependent personality symptoms compared to men.''Perimenopause'', which is the time of life immediately before and after ''menopause'', can last as long as 10 years. While ''perimenopause'' and ''menopause'' are normal stages of life, perimenopause increases the risk of depression during that time. Also, women who have had depression in the past are five times more likely to develop major depression during perimenopause.' "
Depression symptoms and signs in teenagers,"'In addition to becoming more irritable, teens might lose interest in activities they formerly enjoyed, experience a change in their weight, and start abusing substances. They may also take more risks, show less concern for their safety, and they are more likely to complete suicide than their younger counterparts when depressed. Generally, ''acne'' increases the risk of ''teen depression''.'  "
Depression symptoms and signs in children,"'Since ''babies'', toddlers, and preschool children are usually unable to express their feelings in words, they tend to show sadness in their behaviors. For example, they may become withdrawn, resume old, younger behaviors (regress), or fail to thrive. School-age children might regress in their school performance, develop physical complaints, ''anxiety'', or irritability. Interestingly, some children may try more, sometimes even excessively, to please others when depressed as a way of compensating for their low self-esteem. Therefore, their good grades and apparently good relationships with others may make depression harder to recognize.''Children and adolescents with depression may also experience the classic symptoms as adults as described above, but they may exhibit other symptoms instead of or in addition to those symptoms, including the following:' Poor school performance Persistent boredom or irritability Frequent complaints of physical problems such as headaches and stomachaches Some of the classic ""adult"" symptoms of depression may also be more or less obvious during childhood compared to the actual emotions of sadness, such as a change in eating or sleeping patterns. (Has the child or teen lost or gained weight or failed to gain appropriate weight for their age in recent weeks or months? Does he or she seem more tired than usual? Does the minor have a sense of low self-worth?)"
What are the risk factors and causes of depression?,"'Some types of depression run in families, indicating an inheritable biological vulnerability to depression. This seems to be the case, especially with bipolar disorder. Researchers have studied families in which members of each generation develop bipolar disorder. The investigators found that those with the illness have a somewhat different genetic ''makeup'' than those who do not become ill. However, the reverse is not true. That is, not everybody with the genetic makeup that causes vulnerability to bipolar disorder will develop the illness. Apparently, additional factors, like a stressful environment, are involved in its onset and protective factors, like good support from family and friends, are involved in its prevention.''Major depression also seems to occur in generation after generation in some families, although not as strongly as in bipolar I or II. Indeed, major depression can also occur in people who have no family history of depression.''An external event often seems to initiate an episode of depression. Thus, a serious loss, chronic illness, difficult relationship, exposure to abuse, neglect or community violence, financial problem, or any negative life events or unwelcome changes in life patterns can trigger a depressive episode and chronic exposure to such negative factors can result in persistent depression. People exposed to numerous and/or severe stressors as young children may develop changes in their brain structure that may make them prone to developing depression during adulthood.''Very often, a combination of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors is involved in the onset of a depressive disorder. Stressors that contribute to the development of depression sometimes affect some groups more than others. For example, minority groups who more often feel impacted by discrimination are disproportionately represented. Socioeconomically disadvantaged groups have higher rates of depression compared to their advantaged counterparts. Immigrants to the United States may be more vulnerable to developing depression, particularly when isolated by language.''Regardless of ethnicity, men appear to be particularly sensitive to the depressive effects of unemployment, divorce, low socioeconomic status, and having few good ways to cope with ''stress''. Women who have been the victim of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, either as a child or perpetrated by a romantic partner are vulnerable to developing a depressive disorder, as well. Men who engage in sex with other men seem to be particularly vulnerable to depression when they have no domestic partner, do not identify themselves as homosexual, or have been the victim of multiple episodes of antigay violence. However, it seems that men and women have similar risk factors for depression for the most part.''Nothing in the universe is as complex and fascinating as the human brain. Neurochemicals or neurotransmitters make up the 100-plus chemicals that circulate in the brain. Much of our research and knowledge, however, has focused on four of these neurochemical systems: norepinephrine, serotonin, ''dopamine'', and acetylcholine.''Different neuropsychiatric illnesses seem to be associated with an overabundance or a lack of some of these neurochemicals in certain parts of the brain. For example, a lack of dopamine at the base of the brain causes '""Parkinson's""' disease. There appears to be a relation between '""Alzheimer's""' ''dementia'' and lower acetylcholine levels in the brain. The addictive disorders are under the influence of the neurochemical dopamine. That is to say, ''drugs'' of abuse and ''alcohol'' work by releasing dopamine in the brain. The dopamine causes ''euphoria'', which is a pleasant sensation. Repeated use of drugs or alcohol, however, desensitizes the dopamine system, which means that the system gets used to the effects of drugs and alcohol. Therefore, a person needs more drugs or alcohol to achieve the same high feeling (builds up tolerance to the substance). Thus, the addicted person takes more substance but feels less and less high and increasingly depressed. There are also some drugs whose effects can include depression (these include alcohol, narcotics, and ''marijuana'') and those for whom depression can be a symptom of withdrawal from the substance (including ''caffeine'', ''cocaine'', or ''amphetamines'').''Certain medications used for a variety of medical conditions are more likely than others to cause depression as a side effect. Specifically, some medications that treat ''high blood pressure'', ''cancer'', ''seizures'', extreme ''pain'', and to achieve ''contraception'' can result in depression. Even some psychiatric medications, like some ''sleep aids'' and medications to treat ''alcoholism'' and anxiety, can contribute to the development of depression.''Many mental health conditions or developmental disabilities are associated with depression, as well. Individuals with anxiety, ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD''), substance abuse, and developmental disabilities may be more vulnerable to developing depression.''Schizophrenia'' is associated with an imbalance of dopamine (too much) and serotonin (poorly regulated) in certain areas of the brain. Finally, the depressive disorders appear to be associated with altered brain serotonin and norepinephrine systems. Both of these neurochemicals may be lower in depressed people. Please note that depression is ""associated with"" instead of ""caused by"" abnormalities of these neurochemicals because we really don\'t know whether low levels of neurochemicals in the brain cause depression or whether depression causes low levels of neurochemicals in the brain.''What we do know is certain medications that alter the levels of norepinephrine or serotonin can alleviate the symptoms of depression. Some medicines that affect both of these neurochemical systems appear to perform even better or faster. Other medications that treat depression primarily affect the other neurochemical systems. One of the most powerful treatments for depression, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), is certainly not specific to any particular neurotransmitter system. Rather, ECT, by causing a ''seizure'', produces a generalized brain activity that probably releases massive amounts of all of the neurochemicals.'""Women are twice as likely to become depressed as men. However, scientists do not know the reason for this difference. Psychological factors also contribute to a person's vulnerability to depression. Thus, persistent deprivation in infancy, physical or sexual abuse, exposure to community violence, clusters of certain personality traits, and inadequate ways of coping (maladaptive coping mechanisms) all can increase the frequency and severity of depressive disorders, with or without inherited vulnerability.""'The presence of maternal-fetal ''stress'' is another risk factor for depression. It seems that maternal stress during ''pregnancy'"" can increase the chance that the child will be prone to depression as an adult, particularly if there is a genetic vulnerability. Researchers believe that the mother's circulating stress hormones can influence the development of the fetus' brain during pregnancy. This altered fetal brain development occurs in ways that predispose the child to the risk of depression as an adult. Further research is still necessary to clarify how this happens. Again, this situation shows the complex interaction between genetic vulnerability and environmental stress, in this case, the stress of the mother on the fetus."" "
Postpartum depression,"'Postpartum depression'' (PPD) is a condition that describes a range of physical and emotional changes that many mothers can have after having a baby. PPD can be treated with medication and counseling. Talk with your health care provider right away if you think you have PPD that is interfering with your ability to function in any way.''There are three types of PPD women can have after giving birth:' The so-called ""baby blues"" happen in many women in the days right after childbirth. A new mother can have sudden mood swings, such as feeling very happy and then feeling very sad or angry. She may cry for no reason and can feel impatient, irritable, restless, anxious, lonely, and sad. The baby blues may last only a few hours or as long as one to two weeks after delivery. The baby blues do not always require treatment from a health care professional. Often, sharing childcare duties, 
	maintaining contacts with loved ones, joining a support group of new moms, or talking with other moms helps. Postpartum depression (PPD) can happen a few days or even months after childbirth. PPD can happen after the birth of any child, not just the first child. A woman can have feelings similar to the baby blues -- sadness, despair, anxiety, irritability -- but she feels them much more strongly than she would with the baby blues. PPD often keeps a woman from doing the things she needs to do every day. 
	If PPD affects a woman's ability to function, this is a sure sign that she needs to see her health care professional right away. If a woman does not get treatment for PPD, symptoms can get worse and last for as long as one year. While PPD is a serious condition, it can be treated with medication and counseling. Postpartum psychosis is a very serious mental illness that can affect new mothers. This illness can happen quickly, often within the first three months after childbirth. Women can experience psychotic depression, in that the depression causes them to lose touch with reality, have auditory hallucinations (hearing things that aren't actually happening, like a person talking 
	when there is no one there), and delusions (interpreting things 
	completely differently from what they are in reality). Visual hallucinations (seeing things that aren't there) are less common. Other symptoms include insomnia (not being able to sleep), feeling agitated (unsettled) and angry, strange feelings and behaviors, as well as less commonly having suicidal or homicidal thoughts. Women who have postpartum psychosis need treatment right away and almost always need medication. Sometimes 
	doctors hospitalize women because they are at risk for hurting themselves or someone else, including their baby."
What specialists treat depression?,"'A variety of health care specialists evaluate and treat people with this condition, including the following:' Primary care providers like family doctors, internal-medicine practitioners, 
gynecologists, or geriatricians (physicians who specialize in treating the elderly) Mental health specialists, such as psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, social workers, pastoral or mental health nurses, or other counselors Primary care or mental health prescribers, like physician assistants or nurse practitioners Health-maintenance organizations Community mental health centers Hospital psychiatry departments and outpatient clinics Community support groups, often hospital affiliated University or medical school-affiliated programs State hospital outpatient clinics Family service/social agencies Private clinics and facilities Employee assistance programs Local medical and/or psychiatric societies
"
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose depression?,"'People who wonder if they should talk to their health professional about whether or not they have depression might consider taking a depression quiz or self-test, which asks questions about depressive symptoms that are included in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5''), the accepted diagnostic reference for mental illnesses. In thinking about when to seek medical advice about depression, the sufferer can benefit from considering if the sadness lasts more than two weeks or so or if the way they are feeling significantly interferes with their ability to function at home, school, work, or in their relationships with others. The first step to getting appropriate treatment is accurate diagnosis, which requires a complete physical and psychological evaluation to determine whether the person may have a depressive illness, and if so, what type. As previously mentioned, the side effects of certain medications, as well as some medical conditions and exposure to certain drugs of abuse, can include symptoms of depression. Therefore, the examining physician should rule out (exclude) these possibilities through a clinical interview, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Many primary care doctors use screening tools, which are symptom tests, for depression.  Such tests are usually questionnaires that help identify people who have symptoms of depression and may need to receive a full mental health evaluation.'""A thorough diagnostic evaluation includes a complete history of the patient's symptoms:""'The doctor usually asks about alcohol and ''drug use'' and whether the patient has had thoughts about death or suicide. Further, the history often includes questions about whether other family members have had a depressive illness, and if treated, what treatments they received and which were effective. Professionals are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of exploring potential cultural differences in how people with depression experience, understand, and express depression in order to appropriately assess and treat this condition.'""A diagnostic evaluation also includes a mental-status examination to determine if the patient's speech, thought pattern, or memory has been affected, as often happens in the case of a depressive or manic-depressive illness.""'As of today, there is no laboratory test, blood test, or X-ray that can diagnose a mental disorder. Even the powerful CT, ''MRI'', SPECT, and PET scans, which can help diagnose other neurological disorders such as ''stroke'' or ''brain tumors'', cannot detect the subtle and complex brain changes in psychiatric illness. However, these techniques are currently useful ruling out the presence of a number of physical disorders and in research on mental health and perhaps in the future they will be useful for the diagnosis of depression, as well.' When did the symptoms start and under what circumstances/stressors? How long have symptoms lasted? How severe are the symptoms? Have the symptoms occurred before, and if so, were they treated, what treatment was received, and was it effective?"
What treatments are available for depression?,"'Regardless of the medication that treats depression, practitioners have become more aware that both genders, each age group, and different ethnic groups may have different responses and have different risks for medication side effects than others.  Also, while there are certainly treatment methods that have been determined to be effective across populations, given the individual variability of response to treatment, there should not be a one-size-fits-all approach to treatment.''Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)'' are medications that increase the amount of the neurochemical serotonin in the brain. (Remember that brain serotonin levels often are low in depression.) As their name implies, the SSRIs work by selectively inhibiting (blocking) serotonin reuptake in the brain. This block occurs at the synapse, the place where brain cells (neurons) connect to each other. Serotonin is one of the chemicals in the brain that carries messages across these connections (synapses) from one neuron to another.'""The SSRIs work by keeping serotonin present in high concentrations in the synapses. These drugs do this by preventing the reuptake of serotonin back into the sending nerve cell. The reuptake of serotonin is responsible for turning off the production of new serotonin. Therefore, the serotonin message keeps on coming through. This, in turn, helps arouse (activate) cells that have been deactivated by depression, thereby relieving the depressed person's symptoms. SSRIs have fewer side effects than the ""'tricyclic antidepressants'' (TCAs) and ''monoamine oxidase inhibitors'' (''MAOIs''). SSRIs do not interact with the chemical tyramine in foods, as do the MAOIs, and therefore do not require the dietary restrictions of the MAOIs. Also, SSRIs do not cause ''orthostatic hypotension'' (sudden drop in ''blood pressure'' when sitting up or standing) and are less likely to predispose to ''heart''-rhythm disturbances like the TCAs do. Therefore, SSRIs are often the first-line treatment for depression. Examples of SSRIs include ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''fluvoxamine'' (''Luvox''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix), and vilazodone (Viibryd).''Patients generally tolerateSSRIs well, and side effects are usually mild. The most common side effects are ''nausea'' and other stomach upset, ''diarrhea'', agitation, insomnia, and ''headache''. However, these side effects generally go away within the first month of SSRI use. Some patients experience sexual side effects, such as decreased sexual desire (''decreased libido''), delayed ''orgasm'', or an inability to have an orgasm. Sexual side effects occur less often with newer SSRIs like vortioxetine and vilazodone, compared to the older medications in this category.  For those patients, especially for whom anxiety is a prominent symptom of depression, the addition of ''buspirone'' may help enhance the effectiveness (augment) the effect of the SSRI while decreasing or eliminating sexual side effects. Uncommonly, some patients experience ''tremors'', ''hair loss'', or gradual weight gain with SSRIs. The so-called serotonergic (meaning caused by serotonin) syndrome is a serious neurologic condition associated with the use of SSRIs, usually when given in high doses or in combination with another SSRI. High ''fevers'', ''seizures'', and heart-rhythm disturbances characterize serotonergic syndrome. This condition is very rare and tends to occur only in very ill psychiatric patients taking multiple psychiatric medications.'""All patients are unique biochemically. Therefore, the occurrence of side effects or the lack of a satisfactory result with one SSRI does not mean that another medication in this group will not be beneficial. However, if someone in the patient's family has had a positive response to a particular drug, that drug may be the preferable one to try first.""'Dual-action antidepressants'': The biochemical reality is that all classes of medications that treat depression (MAOIs, SSRIs, TCAs, and atypical antidepressants) have some effect on both norepinephrine and serotonin, as well as on other neurotransmitters. However, the various medications affect the different neurotransmitters in varying degrees.''Some of the newer antidepressant drugs, however, appear to have particularly robust effects on both the norepinephrine and serotonin systems. These medications seem to be very promising, especially for the more severe and chronic cases of depression. (Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals, rather than family practitioners, see such cases most frequently.) ''Venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''), and levomilnacipran (Fetzima) are four of these dual-action compounds. Effexor is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor that, at lower doses, shares many of the safety and low side-effect characteristics of the SSRIs. At higher doses, this drug appears to block the reuptake of norepinephrine. Thus, venlafaxine is an SNRI, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Cymbalta and Pristiq tend to act as equally powerful serotonin reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors regardless of the dose, Fetzima even more so. They are, therefore, also SNRIs.''Mirtazapine'' (''Remeron''), another antidepressant, is a tetracyclic compound (four-ring chemical structure). It works at somewhat different biochemical sites and in different ways than the other medications. It affects serotonin but at a postsynaptic site (after the connection between nerve cells). It also increases histamine levels, which can cause drowsiness. For this reason, patients take mirtazapine at bedtime; physicians often prescribe mirtazapine for people who have trouble falling asleep. Like the SNRIs, it also works by increasing levels in the norepinephrine system. Other than causing sedation, this medication has side effects that are similar to those of the SSRIs.''Atypical antidepressants ''work in a variety of ways. Thus, atypical antidepressants are not TCAs, SSRIs, or SNRIs, but they can be effective in treating depression for many people nonetheless. More specifically, they increase the level of certain neurochemicals in the brain synapses (between nerves, where nerves communicate with each other). Examples of atypical antidepressants include ''nefazodone'' (''Serzone''), ''trazodone'' (''Desyrel''), and ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin''). Serzone has come under scrutiny due to rare cases of life-threatening ''liver'' failure that have occurred in some individuals while taking it. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also approved bupropion (''Zyban'') for use in weaning from ''addiction'' to cigarettes. This drug is also being studied for treating ''attention deficit disorder'' (''ADD'') or ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD''). These problems affect many children and adults and restrict their ability to manage their impulses and activity level, focus, or concentrate on one thing at a time.''Lithium'' (Eskalith, ''Lithobid''), valproate (''Depakene'', ''Depakote''), ''carbamazepine'' (''Epitol'', ''Tegretol''), and ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal'') are mood stabilizers and, except for lithium, are used to treat seizures (anticonvulsants). They treat bipolar depression. Certain antipsychotic medications, such as ''ziprasidone'' (''Geodon''), ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), asenapine (Saphris), paliperidone (Invega), iloperidone (Fanapt), lurasidone (''Latuda''), and brexpiprazole (Rexulti), may treat psychotic depression. They have also been found to be effective mood stabilizers and are therefore sometimes been used to treat bipolar depression, usually in combination with other antidepressants.''Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)'' are the earliest developed antidepressants. Examples of MAOIs include phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). MAOIs elevate the levels of neurochemicals in the brain synapses by inhibiting monoamine oxidase. Monoamine oxidase is the main enzyme that breaks down neurochemicals, such as norepinephrine. When monoamine oxidase is inhibited, the norepinephrine is not broken down and, therefore, the amount of norepinephrine in the brain is increased.''MAOIs also impair the ability to break down tyramine, a substance found in aged cheese, wines, most nuts, ''chocolate'', certain processed meats, and some other foods. Tyramine, like norepinephrine, can elevate blood pressure. Therefore, the consumption of tyramine-containing foods by a patient taking an ''MAOI'' drug can cause elevated blood levels of tyramine and dangerously ''high blood pressure''. In addition, MAOIs can interact with ''over-the-counter'' ''cold'' and ''cough'' medications to cause dangerously ''high blood pressure''. The reason for this is that these cold and ''cough'' medications often contain drugs that likewise can increase blood pressure. Because of these potentially serious drug and food interactions, MAOIs are usually only prescribed for people who are thought to be willing and able to manage the many dietary restrictions required by these medications and after other treatment options have failed.''Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)'"" were developed in the 1950s and '60s to treat depression. They are called tricyclic antidepressants because their chemical structures consist of three chemical rings. TCAs work mainly by increasing the level of norepinephrine in the brain synapses, although they also may affect serotonin levels. Doctors often use TCAs to treat moderate to severe depression. Examples of tricyclic antidepressants are ""'amitriptyline'' (''Elavil''), protriptyline (Vivactil), ''desipramine'' (''Norpramin''), ''nortriptyline'' (Aventyl, ''Pamelor''), ''imipramine'' (''Tofranil''), ''trimipramine'' (''Surmontil''), and perphenazine (Triavil).''Tetracyclic antidepressants are similar in action to tricyclics, but their structure has four chemical rings. Examples of tetracyclics include ''maprotiline'' (''Ludiomil'') and mirtazapine (Remeron).''TCAs are safe and generally well tolerated when properly prescribed and administered. However, if taken in overdose, TCAs can cause life-threatening heart-rhythm disturbances. Some TCAs can also have anticholinergic side effects, which are due to the blocking of the activity of the nerves that are responsible for control of the heart rate, gut motion, visual focus, and saliva production. Thus, some TCAs can produce ''dry mouth'', ''blurred vision'', ''constipation'', and ''dizziness'' upon standing. The ''dizziness'' results from ''low blood pressure'' that occurs upon standing (orthostatic ''hypotension''). Anticholinergic side effects can also aggravate narrow-angle ''glaucoma'', urinary obstruction due to benign ''prostate enlargement'' (hypertrophy), and cause ''delirium'' in the elderly. Patients with ''seizure disorders'' or a history of ''strokes'' should avoid TCAs.''Stimulants'' such as ''methylphenidate'' (''Ritalin'') or ''dextroamphetamine'' (''Dexedrine''), or their derivatives (for example, ''Concerta'', Metadate or ''Focalin''; ''Adderall'' or ''Vyvanse'', or extended-release mixed salts of amphetamine [Mydayis] respectively), which are primarily used to treat ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD''), are also used for the treatment of depression that is resistant to other medications. The stimulants are most commonly used along with other antidepressants or other medications, such as mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, or even ''thyroid hormone''. They are sometimes used alone to treat depression but rarely. The reason they are usually used sparingly and with other ''medications for depression'' is that unlike the other medications, they may induce an emotional rush and a high in both depressed and nondepressed people, particularly if taken in doses or ways other than how they are prescribed. Therefore, the stimulants are potentially addictive drugs.''Phototherapy, a particularly effective treatment for ''seasonal affective disorder'', entails the individual with depression being exposed to cool-white florescent light at a strength of 10,000 lux for half an hour every day.''With the ECT procedure, a brain stimulation therapy, a physician passes an electric current through the brain to produce controlled convulsions (seizures). ECT is useful for certain patients, particularly for those who cannot take or have not responded to a number of antidepressants, have severe depression, and/or are at a high risk for suicide. ECT often is effective in cases where trials of a number of antidepressant medications do not provide sufficient relief of symptoms. This procedure probably works, as previously mentioned, by a massive neurochemical release in the brain due to the controlled ''seizure''. Often highly effective, ECT relieves depression within one to two weeks after beginning treatments in many people. After ECT, some patients will continue to have maintenance ECT, while others will return to antidepressant medications or have a combination of both treatments.''Over the years, the technique of ECT has improved from the procedure that still invokes stigma in the minds of many. Physicians administer the treatment in the hospital under anesthesia so that people receiving ECT do not hurt themselves or feel emotional or physical pain during the induced seizures or at any other time. Most patients undergo six to 10 treatments. A health care professional passes an electrical current through the brain to cause a controlled seizure, which typically lasts for 20-90 seconds. The patient is awake in five to 10 minutes. The most common side effect is ''short-term memory'' loss, which usually resolves quickly. Doctors safely perform ECT as an outpatient procedure.'""Another brain stimulation therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) involves a physician passing an electrical current through an insulated coil that is placed on the surface of the depression sufferer's ""'scalp''. That induces a brief magnetic field that can change the electrical flow of the brain that is effective in easing symptoms of depression or anxiety. TMS does not require anesthesia; doctors perform TMS for a few minutes per session, five times per week over the course of four to six weeks. Side effects are usually mild and fade quickly, including scalp discomfort or ''headaches''. It is unusual for side effects to be severe enough to cause the recipient to stop treatment prematurely. Serious side effects are rare, including worsened depression, ''suicidal thoughts'', or actions.''Transcranial magnetic stimulation is effective in alleviating depression or anxiety in people who did not respond to psychiatric medication.''Many forms of psychotherapy are effective at helping depressed individuals, including some short-term (10-20 weeks) therapies. ''Talking'' therapies (psychotherapies) help patients gain insight into their problems and resolve them through verbal give-and-take with the therapist. ''Behavioral'' therapists help patients learn how to obtain more satisfaction and rewards through their own actions. These therapists conduct ''behavior therapy'' to help patients to unlearn the behavioral patterns that may contribute to their depression.''Interpersonal ''and'' cognitive/behavioral'"" therapies are two of the short-term psychotherapies that research has shown to be helpful for some forms of depression. Interpersonal therapists focus on the patient's disturbed personal relationships that both cause and exacerbate the depression. Cognitive/behavioral therapists help patients change the negative styles of thinking and behaving that are often associated with depression. A form of ""'cognitive behavioral therapy'"", dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) tends to focus on intensive, simultaneous acceptance of the depression sufferer's abilities, while motivating emotionally healthy changes using a highly structured approach. This form of therapy treats severely or chronically depressed people. ""'Psychodynamic'"" therapies sometimes treat depression. They focus on resolving the patient's internal psychological conflicts rooted in childhood. Long-term psychodynamic therapies are particularly important if there seems to be a lifelong history and pattern of inadequate ways of coping (maladaptive coping mechanisms) by using negative or self-injurious behavior.""'The future is very bright for the treatment of depression. In response to the customs and practices of their patients from a variety of cultures, physicians are becoming more sensitized to and knowledgeable about natural remedies. ''Vitamins'' and other nutritional ''supplements'' like ''vitamin D'"", folate, and vitamin B12 may be useful in alleviating mild depression when used alone or more severe degrees of depression when used in combination with an antidepressant medication. Another intervention from alternative medicine is St. John's wort  (""'Hypericum perforatum'""). This herbal remedy is helpful for some individuals who suffer from mild depression. However, St. John's wort being an herbal remedy is no guarantee against developing complications. For example, its chemical similarity to many antidepressants disqualifies it from being given to people who are taking those medications.""  "
What is the general approach to treating depression?,"'In general, the severe depressive illnesses, particularly those that are recurrent, will require antidepressant medications, phototherapy for winter seasonal depression (or ECT or TMS in severe cases) along with psychotherapy for the best outcome. If a person suffers one major depressive episode, he or she has up to about a 75% chance of a second episode. If the individual suffers two major depressive episodes, the chance of a third episode is about 80%. If the person suffers three episodes, the likelihood of a fourth episode is 90%-95%. Therefore, after a first depressive episode, it may make sense for the patient to come off medication gradually. However, after a second and certainly after a third episode, most clinicians will have a patient remain on a maintenance dosage of the medication for an extended period of years, if not permanently.'""Patience is required because the treatment of depression takes time. Sometimes, the doctor will need to try a variety of antidepressants before finding the medication or combination of medications that is most effective for the patient. Sometimes, it's necessary to increase the dosage to be effective or decrease the dosage to alleviate medication side effects.""""In choosing an antidepressant, the doctor will take into account the patient's specific symptoms of depression, as well as his or her age, other medical conditions, and medication side effects. Of particular importance is that children and adolescents continue to use antidepressant medication with caution because of uncommon instances in which minors become acutely worse instead of better while receiving this treatment.""""Doctors often use one of the SSRIs initially because of their lower severity of side effects compared to the other classes of antidepressants. It's possible to further minimize side effects of SSRI medications by starting them at low doses and gradually increasing the doses to achieve full therapeutic effects. For those patients who do not respond after taking a SSRI at full doses for six to eight weeks, doctors often switch to a different SSRI or another class of antidepressants. For patients whose depression failed to respond to full doses of one or two SSRIs or whom could not tolerate those medications, doctors will usually then try medications from another class of antidepressants. Some doctors believe that antidepressants with dual action (action on both serotonin and norepinephrine), such as duloxetine (Cymbalta), (Cymbalta), mirtazapine (Remeron), venlafaxine (Effexor), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq), and levomilnacipran (Fetzima), may be effective in treating patients with severe depression that is treatment resistant. Other options include bupropion (Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL, Zyban), which has action on dopamine (another neurotransmitter).""'Increasingly, doctors may use a combination of antidepressants from different classes or add a medication from a completely different chemical class, such as Abilify or Seroquel, that are thought to enhance the effectiveness of antidepressant medication more rapidly than adding or switching to a second antidepressant. Also, new types of antidepressants are constantly being developed, and one of these may be the best for a particular patient.'""If the depressed person is taking more than one medication for depression or medications for any other medical problem, each of the patient's doctors should be aware of the other prescriptions. Many of these medications clear from the body (metabolized) in the liver. This means that the multiple treatments can interact competitively with the liver's biochemical clearing systems. Therefore, the actual blood levels of the medications may be higher or lower than would be expected from the dosage. This information is especially important if the patient is taking ""'anticoagulants'' (blood thinners), anticonvulsants (seizure medications), or heart medications, such as digitalis (''Crystodigin'""). Although multiple medications do not necessarily pose a problem, all of the patient's doctors may need to be in close contact to adjust dosages accordingly.""'Patients often are tempted to stop their medication too soon, especially when they begin feeling better. It is important to keep taking medication therapy until the doctor says to stop, even if the patient feels better beforehand. Doctors often will continue the antidepressant medications for at least six to 12 months after symptoms are alleviated because the risk of depression quickly returning when treatment is stopped decreases after that period of time in those people experiencing their first depressive episode. Patients must stop some medications gradually to give the body time to adjust (see discontinuation of antidepressants below). For individuals with bipolar disorder, recurrent or chronic major depression, medication may have to become a part of everyday life for an extended period of years in order to avoid disabling symptoms.''Antidepressant medications are not habit-forming, so there need not be concern about that. However, as is the case with any type of medication prescribed for more than a few days, physicians must carefully monitor antidepressant use to ensure that the patient is getting the correct dosage. The doctor will want to check the dosage and its effectiveness regularly.''If the patient is taking MAOIs, he or she must avoid certain aged, fermented, or pickled foods, like many wines, processed meats, and cheeses. The patient should obtain a complete list of prohibited foods from the doctor and keep it available at all times. The other types of antidepressants require no food restrictions. It is also important to note that some over-the-counter cold and cough medicines can also cause problems when taken with MAOIs.''People should try to avoid mixing medications of any kind (prescribed, over the counter, or borrowed) without consulting their doctor. Patients should inform their dentist or any other medical specialist who prescribes a drug that he or she is taking antidepressants. Some medications that are harmless when taken alone can cause severe and dangerous side effects when taken with other medications. This may also be the case for individuals taking ''supplements'"" or herbal remedies. Some addictive substances, like alcohol (including wine, beer, and liquor), tranquilizers, narcotics or marijuana, reduce the effectiveness of antidepressants and can cause mental health and/or physical symptoms. Patients should avoid these. These and other drugs can be dangerous when the person's body is either intoxicated with or withdrawing from their effects due to increasing the risk of seizure or heart problems in combination with antidepressants medications.""'Antianxiety drugs such as ''diazepam'' (''Valium''), ''alprazolam'' (''Xanax''), and ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan'') are not antidepressants, but doctors occasionally prescribe these alone or with antidepressants for a brief period of anxiety. However, patients should not\xa0 take these alone for depressive disorder. Due to their addiction potential, patients should phase out the antianxiety drugs as soon as the antidepressant and antianxiety effects of the antidepressant medications begin to work, which is usually in four to six weeks.''Finally, patients should consult their doctor concerning any questions about a medication or problem that the patient believes is medication related.'  "
What about sexual dysfunction related to antidepressants?,"'The SSRI antidepressants can cause sexual dysfunction. SSRIs reportedly decrease sex drive (libido) in both men and women. SSRIs reportedly cause inability to achieve orgasm or delay in achieving orgasm (anorgasmia) in women and difficulty with ejaculation (delay in ejaculating or loss of ability to ejaculate) and erections in men. Sexual dysfunction with SSRIs is common though the exact incidence is unknown. Newer SSRIs like vortioxetine and vilazodone have little to no negative impact on sexual functioning. Furthermore, patients have reported sexual side effects with the use of other antidepressant classes such a MAOIs, TCAs, and dual-action antidepressants.''Management of sexual dysfunction due to SSRIs includes the following options:' Decrease the SSRI dose. This option may be appropriate if the patient is on high doses of an SSRI. However, reducing the SSRI dose may also diminish the antidepressant effect. Remember, patients should never change medications and medication doses on their own without permission and monitoring by his/her doctor. Switch to another SSRI. Newer SSRIs like vortioxetine (Trintellix) and vilazodone (Viibryd) cause sexual dysfunction less than the older SSRIs. Trial of sildenafil (Viagra) or other sexual-enhancement medication. Studies in men whose depression has responded to SSRI but have developed sexual dysfunction showed improvement in sexual function with Viagra. Men taking Viagra reported significant improvements in arousal, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm as compared to men who were taking placebo, although Viagra generally does not increase one's libido. For men who do not respond to Viagra (and for women with sexual dysfunction due to SSRI), 
	switching to a newer SSRI or to another class of antidepressants may be helpful. For example, bupropion, mirtazapine, and duloxetine may have no sexual side effects or significantly less sexual side effects than SSRIs. For patients who are unable to switch from an older SSRI to either a newer SSRI or to another class of antidepressants either because of lack of tolerance or lack of therapeutic response, the doctor may consider adding another medication to the SSRI. For example, some doctors have reported success by adding bupropion to SSRIs to improve sexual function.  Some doctors also may use buspirone (BuSpar) to improve sexual function in patients treated with SSRIs. More clinical studies 
	may determine whether this strategy works."
What about discontinuing antidepressants?,"'Patients gradually should taper antidepressants and should not be abruptly discontinued. Abruptly stopping an antidepressant in some patients can cause discontinuation syndrome.''For example, abruptly stopping an SSRI such as paroxetine can cause dizziness, ''nausea'', ''flu-like symptoms'', body aches, anxiety, irritability, ''fatigue'', and vivid dreams. These symptoms typically occur within days of abrupt cessation, and can last one to two weeks (up to 21 days). Among the SSRIs, paroxetine and fluvoxamine cause more pronounced discontinuation symptoms than fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, vortioxetine, and vilazodone. Some patients experience discontinuation symptoms despite gradual tapering of the SSRI. Abrupt cessation of venlafaxine, duloxetine, desvenlafaxine, or levomilnacipran can cause discontinuation symptoms similar to those of SSRIs.''Abruptly stopping MAOIs can lead to irritability, agitation, and delirium. Similarly, abruptly stopping a TCA can cause agitation, irritability, and ''abnormal heart rhythms''.' "
What are complications of depression?,"'Depression can have a significant impact on the structure and function of many parts of the brain. This can result in many negative consequences. For example, people with severe depression are at higher risk of suffering from anxiety, chronic depression, other emotional issues, or having more medical problems or ''chronic pain''. The trouble thinking (cognitive problems) that depression sufferers may experience can persist even after the illness resolves. People with a chronic illness, such as ''diabetes'' and ''heart disease'', who also have depression tend to have worse outcome of their medical illness.' "
What is the prognosis for depression?,"'Even though clinical depression tends to occur in episodes, most people who experience one such episode will eventually have another one. Also, it seems that any subsequent episodes of depression are more easily triggered than the first one. However, most depression sufferers recover from the episode. In fact, individuals who have mild depression and receive treatment with medication tend to respond equally as well to ''sugar'' pill (placebo). Those with more severe depression seem to be less likely to get better when taking placebo versus taking antidepressant medication. Other encouraging information is that research shows that even people from teenage through adulthood who do not improve when treated with a first medication trial can improve when switched to another medication or given another medication in addition to psychotherapy. For individuals who experience thoughts of suicide, preventing access to firearms and other highly lethal means of committing suicide are important ways to improve their safety and that of those around them.' "
Is it possible to prevent depression?,"'Programs that use mental health professionals to teach thinking skills (cognitive techniques) that assist in coping with stress seem to be effective in preventing depression. Key aspects in the prevention of postpartum depression include helping new mothers decrease those specific aspects of their lives that may contribute to depression, like having little social support and poor adjustment to their marriage or other domestic union. Engaging in religious or spiritual practices can often prevent depression, thought to be the result of decreasing stress, increasing a sense of hope, and providing a sense of community. On the other hand, people who feel they are unable to live up to the standards set by their family, societal, religious, or spiritual practices may feel a sense of guilt that becomes a risk factor for depression.' "
What about self-help and home remedies for depression?,"'Depressive disorders can make those afflicted feel exhausted, worthless, helpless, and hopeless. Such negative thoughts and feelings make some people feel like giving up. It is important to realize that these negative views are part of the depressive illness and typically do not accurately reflect the actual situation. Negative thinking fades as treatment begins to take effect. In the meantime, the following are helpful tips for how to fight depression:' Eat healthy foods 
	and stay hydrated. The frequent lack of adequate nutrients, including water, and presence of excessive fats, sugars, and sodium in fast foods can further sap the energy of depression sufferers. Many may find that folate and vitamin D food supplements help coping with depression. Make time to get enough rest to promote improvement in your mood. Express your feelings, either to friends, in a journal, or using art to help release some negative feelings. Do not set difficult goals for yourself or take on a great deal of responsibility while dealing with depression. Break large tasks into small ones, set some priorities, and do what you can when you can. Do not expect too much from yourself too soon as this will only increase feelings of failure. Try to be with other people, which is usually better than being alone. Participate in activities that may make you feel better. You might try exercising, going to a movie or a ball game, or participating in religious or social activities. Don't rush or overdo it. Don't get upset if you do not feel ""cured"" right away. Feeling better takes time. Do not make major life decisions, such as changing jobs or getting married or divorced 
	until your depression has improved without consulting others who know you well. These people often can have a more objective view of your situation. Remember, do not accept your negative thinking. It is part of the depression and will disappear as your depression responds to treatment. Plan how you would get help for yourself in an emergency, like calling 
	friends, family, your physical or mental health professional, a local emergency room, 
	or mental health crisis center if you were to develop thoughts of harming yourself or someone else. Limit your access to things that could hurt yourself or others (for example, do not keep excess medication of any kind, firearms, or other weapons in the home)."
How can someone help a depressed person?,"'Family and friends can help! Since depression can make the affected person feel exhausted and helpless, he or she will want and probably need help from others. However, people who have never had a depressive disorder may not fully understand its effects. Although unintentional, friends and loved ones may unknowingly say and do things that may be hurtful to the depressed person. If you are struggling with depression, it may help to share the information in this article with those you most care about so they can better understand and help you.'""The most important thing anyone can do for the depressed person is to help him or her get an appropriate diagnosis and treatment. This help may involve encouraging the individual to stay with treatment until symptoms begin to go away (usually several weeks) or to seek different treatment if no improvement occurs. On occasion, it may require making an appointment and accompanying the depressed person to the doctor. It may also mean monitoring whether the depressed person is taking medication for several months after symptoms have improved. Always report a worsening depression to the patient's physician or therapist.""""The second most important way to help someone with depression is to offer emotional support. This support involves understanding, patience, affection, and encouragement to the depression sufferer. Engage the depressed person in conversation and listen carefully. Do not disparage feelings expressed, but point out realities and offer hope. Do not ignore remarks about suicide. Always take them seriously and report them to the depressed person's therapist.""'Invite the depressed person for walks, outings, and to the movies and other activities. Be gently insistent if the depressed individual refuses your invitation. Encourage participation in activities that once gave pleasure, such as hobbies, sports, or religious or cultural activities. However, do not push the depressed person to undertake too much too soon. The depressed person needs company and diversion, but too many demands can increase feelings of failure and exhaustion.''Do not accuse the depressed person of faking illness or of laziness. Do not expect him or her ""to snap out of it."" Eventually, with treatment, most depressed people do get better. Keep that in mind. Moreover, keep reassuring the depressed person that, with time and help, it is highly likely that he or she will feel better.' "
Where can one seek help for depression?,"'A complete physical and psychological diagnostic evaluation by professionals will help the depressed person decide the type of treatment that might be best for him or her, including if they are in need of treatment for a physical condition that is causing or contributing to their depressed mood. However, if the situation is urgent because a suicide seems possible, having loved ones take the person to the emergency room for evaluation by an emergency-room doctor is essential. If the patient makes a suicide gesture or attempt, call 911. The patient might not realize how much help he or she needs. In fact, he or she might feel undeserving of help because of the negativity and helplessness that is a part of depressive illness.' "
What is in the future for depression?,"""We are close to having genetic markers for bipolar disorder. Soon after, we hope to have them for major depression. That way, we can know of a child's vulnerability to depression from birth and try to create preventive strategies. For example, we can teach parents the added importance of providing a supportive and otherwise healthy environment given their child's vulnerability.  Parents can also be taught the early warning signs of depression so that they can get treatment for their children, if necessary, to ward off future problems.""'The new world of pharmacogenetics holds the promise of actually keeping the genes responsible for depression turned off so as to avoid the illnesses completely. Also, by studying genes, we are learning more about the matching of patients with treatment. This kind of information can tell us which patients do well on which types of drugs and psychotherapy regimens.''We are learning more about the interactions of the neurochemicals, the chemical messengers in the brain, and their influence on depression. Moreover, researchers now study new categories of neurochemicals, such as neuropeptides and substance P. As a result, we will soon be able to develop new drugs that should be more effective with fewer side effects. We are also learning startling things about how maternal stress early in pregnancy can profoundly affect the developing fetus. For example, we now know that maternal stress can greatly increase the risk for the fetus to develop depression as an adult.''Physicians continue to investigate how to most effectively make treatment of depression available and acceptable to all who need it. This is particularly important for children and adolescents, minorities, individuals who are economically disadvantaged or live in rural areas, the elderly and for people with developmental disabilities, who suffer from lack of adequate access to mental health treatment that is knowledgeable and respectful of what may be their unique needs and preferences. While sadness will always be part of the human condition, hopefully we will be able to lessen or eradicate the more severe mood disorders from the world to the benefit of all of us.' "

What is depression?,"'Depression'' is a psychiatric illness that affects one in six people in the United States. Nearly two-thirds of people with ''depression'' do not realize that they have a treatable illness and do not seek treatment.''Depression'' is characterized by persistent feelings of despondency. It is different from the short-lived feeling of unhappiness when a person feels down at times. If this feeling stays for months on end, the person must talk to people close to them about it or seek professional help. This is because\xa0 untreated severe ''depression'' can culminate in ''suicide'', the tenth leading cause of death reported in the United States.' "
How is depression treated?,"'A person with depression may initially turn to family and friends to get emotional support from them. Venting their feelings (mental catharsis) in front of people close to them helps calm down their depressive feelings. If these feelings keep coming back or are persistent, it becomes necessary to seek professional help for depression.''Psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors and mental therapists are the various professionals who help to treat or counsel people with depression. Medications prescribed for depression known as ''antidepressants'' exhibit their effects within a week. They may sometimes take more than a week to work best. Along with medications, various therapies are employed to treat depression that includes psychotherapies (''cognitive behavioral therapy'') that help patients with depression to change the way they feel about the situations in their life.''People who receive support from friends and family and who are in touch with professional psychiatric support are less likely to act on their ''suicidal'' impulses than are those who remain aloof.''If a person feels that someone around them is ''depressed'' and is contemplating ''suicide'', they can call on any of the below helplines' 911  Local suicide prevention hotline The Substance Abuse and Mental Health (SAMHSA) National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255)"
What causes depression and suicidal tendencies? ,"'Depression could happen when there is a decrease in the functional balance of the brain chemicals e.g., serotonin and norepinephrine. These chemicals (neurotransmitters) transfer the information from one nerve cell to another. Decreased norepinephrine causes dullness and lethargy and decreased serotonin causes irritability, hostility, ''mood swings'' and ''suicidal'' ideation.''A single factor does not cause depression, rather the cause is multifactorial.''Not everyone affected by depression ends their life. However, some factors greatly increase an individual’s risk of suicide.''The common ones include''Other risk factors include''Depression can also be due to an existing physical illness.

What is childhood depression?,"""Clinically significant depression is being severe enough to interfere with one's ability to function. It is quite common at every age, affecting more than 16% of children in the United States at some time in their lives and thought to be increasing in children and adolescents, both in this country and elsewhere. Other statistics about depression include its tendency to occur at a rate of about 2% prior to the teenage years and at approximately 5%-8% when both adolescents and children younger than adolescence are considered. It is a leading cause of health impairment (morbidity) and death (mortality). About 3,000 adolescents and young adults die by ""'suicide'' each year in the United States, making it the third leading cause of death in people 10-24 years of age.' "
What are the types of depression in children?,"'Children may suffer from the episodes of moderate to severe depression associated with major depressive disorder, or more chronic, mild to moderate low mood of ''dysthymia''. Depression may also be part of other mood disorders like ''bipolar disorder'', as a ''result of psychosis (for example, having symptoms of ''delusions'' or ''hallucinations''), as part of a medical condition like ''hypothyroidism'', or the result of exposure to certain medications such as ''cold'' medications or ''drug abuse'', like ''cocaine'' withdrawal.' "
What are causes and risk factors for depression in children?,"'Depressive disorders in children does not have one specific cause. Rather, people with these conditions tend to have a number of biological, psychological, and environmental contributors to its development. Biologically, depression is associated with a deficient level of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain, a smaller size of some areas of the brain and increased activity in other parts of the brain. Girls are more likely to be given the diagnosis of depression than boys, but that is thought to be due to, among other things, biological differences based on gender, and differences in how girls are encouraged to interpret their experiences and respond to it as opposed to boys. There is thought to be at least a partially genetic component to the pattern of children, and ''teens'' with a depressed parent are as much as four times more likely to also develop the disorder. Children who have depression or ''anxiety'' are more prone to have other biological problems, like low birth weight, suffering from a physical condition, trouble sleeping, and to having a mother younger than 18 years old at the time of their birth.''Psychological contributors to depression include low self-esteem, negative social skills, negative ''body image'', being excessively self-critical, and often feeling helpless when dealing with negative events. Children who suffer from conduct disorder, ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD''), clinical ''anxiety'', or who have cognitive or learning problems, as well as trouble engaging in social activities, also have more risk of developing depression.''Depression may be a reaction to life stresses, like ''trauma'', including verbal, physical, or sexual abuse, the death of a loved one, school problems, ''bullying'', or suffering from peer pressure. Youth who are struggling to adapt to the United States culture have found to be at higher risk for developing depression. Research differs as to whether ''obese'' children have an increased risk of developing depression.''Other contributors to this condition include poverty and financial difficulties in general, exposure to violence, social isolation, parental conflict, divorce, and other causes of disruptions to family life. Children who have limited physical activity, poor school performance, or lose a relationship are at higher risk for developing depression, as well.' "
What are the symptoms and warning signs of depression in children?,"'Clinical depression'', also called ''major depression'', is more than sadness that lasts for a day or two. In true depressive illnesses, the symptoms last weeks, months, or sometimes years if not treated. Depression often results in the sufferer being unable to perform daily activities, such as getting out of bed or getting dressed, performing well at school, or playing with peers. General symptoms of a major depressive episode, regardless of age, include having a depressed mood or irritability or difficulty experiencing pleasure for at least two weeks and having at least five of the following signs and symptoms:''Children with depression may also experience the classic symptoms but may exhibit other symptoms as well, including''Examples of risk-taking behaviors in children include unsafe play, like climbing excessively high or ''running'' in the street.''Parents of infants and children with depression often report noticing the following behavior changes in the child:'   Feeling sad or blue and/or irritable or seeming that way as observed by others (for examples, tearfulness or otherwise looking persistently sad, or angry) Significant appetite changes, with or without significant weight loss, failing to gain weight appropriately or gaining excessive weight Change in sleep pattern: trouble sleeping or sleeping too much Physical agitation or retardation (for example, restlessness or feeling slowed down) Fatigue or low energy/loss of energy Difficulty concentrating Feeling worthless, excessively guilty, or tend to self-blame Thoughts of death or suicide impaired performance of schoolwork, persistent boredom, quickness to anger, frequent physical complaints, like headaches and stomachaches, more risk-taking behaviors and/or showing less concern for their own safety.

How do health care professionals diagnose depression in children? What health care specialists diagnose and treat childhood depression?,"'Many health care providers can help determine if the diagnosis of clinical depression is appropriate in children, including licensed mental health counselors, pediatricians, other primary care providers, specialists seen for a medical problem, emergency room doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and social workers. Due to the societal stigma that can be associated with receiving mental health treatment, pediatricians and other primary care doctors are often the first professionals approached for diagnosis and treatment of depression. The practitioner consulted to assess a child for depression will likely perform or refer for a thorough medical interview and physical examination as part of assigning the correct diagnosis. Depression is associated with a number of other mental health conditions, like ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD''), ''autism''-spectrum disorders, ''bipolar disorder'', ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), ''obsessive compulsive disorder'' (''OCD''), and ''anxiety'' disorders, so the evaluator will likely screen for signs and symptoms of ''manic'' depression (''bipolar disorder''), a history of trauma, and other mental health symptoms. Childhood depression also may be associated with a number of medical problems, or it can be a side effect of various medications, exposure to ''drugs'' of abuse or other toxins. Therefore, health care professionals often perform routine laboratory tests during the initial assessment to rule out other causes of symptoms. Sometimes, it may be necessary to perform an X-ray, scan, or other imaging study. As part of the evaluation, the sufferer may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help determine the risk of depression and suicide.' "
What should parents do if they suspect that their child is depressed?,"""Family members and friends should seek mental health assessment and treatment for the depressed child. Adult family members may confer with the child's primary care doctor or seek mental health services by contacting one of the resources indicated below. Once the child with depression is receiving treatment, family members can promote good mental health by gently encouraging him or her to have a healthy lifestyle, including encouraging the child to maintain a healthy ""'diet'', including adequate water intake, get enough ''sleep'', ''exercise'' regularly, remain socially active, and to engage in healthy ''stress''-management activities. Research that analyzed the results of several studies (meta-analysis) has found that the positive impact of ''exercise'' on mood is even more than assumed due to its being part of a healthy lifestyle. Parents and other loved ones can also be helpful to the depressed child by discouraging him or her from engaging in risky behaviors.' "
What is the treatment for depression in children?,"'If it is determined that your child is suffering from clinical depression, the health care professional likely will recommend treatment. Treatment options may include alleviating any medical condition that causes or worsens depression. For example, a person who has low levels of ''thyroid hormone'' might receive hormone replacement with levothyroxine (''Synthroid''). Other aspects of treatment may include supportive therapy, like lifestyle and behavioral changes, psychotherapy, complementary treatments, and possibly medication for moderate to severe depression. If symptoms are severe enough that treatment with medication is appropriate, symptoms tend to improve faster and for a longer period when medication is combined with psychotherapy.'""Most mental health professionals will continue treatment of major depression for six months to a year to prevent a reoccurrence of symptoms. Treatment for children with depression can have a significantly positive effect on the child's functioning with peers, family members, and at school. Without treatment, symptoms tend to last much longer, may not improve, or may worsen. With treatment, the chances of recovery are significantly improved.""'Psychotherapy (""talk therapy"") is a kind of mental health counseling that entails working with a trained therapist to figure out ways to solve problems and cope with depression. It can be a powerfully effective intervention, even resulting in positive biochemical changes in the brain. For ''babies'', music therapy and infant ''massage'' are useful interventions. Two major kinds of psychotherapy commonly treat childhood depression: interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. In general, these forms of treatment take weeks to months to complete and has a goal of alleviating depressive symptoms. More intensive psychotherapy may be needed for a longer period of time when treating very severe depression or for depression that is accompanied by other psychiatric symptoms.''Interpersonal therapy (IPT): This form of psychotherapy seeks to alleviate depressive symptoms by helping child with depression develop more effective skills for coping with their emotions and relationships. IPT uses two strategies to achieve those goals:''Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): This approach to psychotherapy helps to decrease depression and the likelihood it will come back by helping the child change his or her way of thinking about certain issues. In CBT, the therapist uses three techniques to achieve these goals.''The most commonly used group of antidepressant medications prescribed for children is the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRI medications influence the levels of serotonin in the brain. For many prescribing professionals, these medications are the first choice because of the significant degree of effectiveness and safety of this group of medicines. Examples of these medications are listed here with the generic name first and the brand name in parentheses.''Only Prozac and Lexapro are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat childhood depression and only in those 8 years of age and older for Prozac, 12 years old and older for Lexapro. Any other medications used to treat this condition in children or using an antidepressant in younger children is therefore considered to be being used ""off label."" In fact, the use of Paxil has fallen out of favor due to its lack of consistent efficacy in the context of the risk of possible side effects.''Although FDA approved for use in teenagers with ''schizophrenia'' rather than for depression, atypical neuroleptic medications like ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify'') and ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal'') are sometimes prescribed in addition to an antidepressant in children who either suffer from severe depression, fail to improve after receiving a trial of an antidepressant in addition to, or instead of, an antidepressant in children who have bipolar disorder.''Doctors sometimes prescribe non-neuroleptic mood-stabilizer medications with an antidepressant to treat children with severe unipolar depression who do not improve after receiving trials of different ''antidepressants''. Physicians might consider these medications in addition to or instead of an antidepressant in children who suffer from bipolar disorder.''Examples of such non-neuroleptic mood stabilizers include ''divalproex'' sodium (''Depakote''), ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol''), and ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal''). Of the non-neuroleptic mood stabilizers, lamotrigine (Lamictal) seems to be unique in its ability to treat unipolar depression effectively by itself as well as in addition to an antidepressant. However, only people 16 years of age or older use the drug due to potentially serious side effects.''Other antidepressant medications work differently than the commonly used SSRIs. Physicians may prescribe the following medications when SSRIs have not worked: ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin''), ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''), or levomilnacipran (Fetzima).''About 60% of children who take antidepressant medication improve. It may take anywhere from one to six weeks of taking medication at its effective dose to start feeling better. The prescribing professional will likely assess the depressed child who is receiving the medication again soon after it is started to determine if the medication is being well tolerated and if symptoms have begun to improve. If not, the doctor or other prescriber might adjust the dose of the medication or prescribe a different one.''After symptoms start to improve, the prescribing health care professional will likely encourage the parents of the depressed child to continue giving the medication for six months to a year because stopping the medication too soon may result in symptoms returning or worsening. Some people need to take the medication for longer to prevent the depression from returning. Stopping treatment abruptly may cause the depression to return or for withdrawal effects (discontinuation syndrome) to occur, depending on which medication the doctor prescribes.''Side effects of antidepressant medications vary significantly from drug to drug and from person to person.''People use a number of nonprescription herbal ''supplements'"" like St. John's wort and ""'dietary supplements'' like ''vitamin C'' and B complex ''vitamins'' as remedies for depression. There is little known about the safety, effectiveness, or appropriate doses of these remedies, despite their being taken by thousands of people around the world.'  Educating the child, his or her parents, and other family members about the nature of depression: The therapist will reassure the child and his or her loved ones that depression is a common illness and that most people tend to improve with treatment. Defining problems (such as abnormal grief or interpersonal conflicts): The therapist can help the child set realistic goals for solving problems and work with him or her and the child's family using different treatment techniques to reach these goals. Didactic component: This phase helps to establish positive expectations for treatment and promote the child's participation in treatment. Cognitive component: This promotes identifying the thoughts and assumptions that play a role in the child's behaviors, especially those that may predispose the sufferer to being depressed. Behavioral component: This uses behavior-modification methods to teach the child more effective ways of dealing with problems. Fluoxetine (Prozac) Sertraline (Zoloft) Paroxetine (Paxil) Fluvoxamine (Luvox) Citalopram (Celexa) Escitalopram (Lexapro) Vortioxetine (Trintellix) Vilazodone (Viibryd) Common side effects can include dry mouth, upset stomach, nausea, tremor, insomnia, blurred vision, constipation, and dizziness. In rare cases, some people of all ages become acutely more depressed when on the medication, even having suicidal or homicidal thoughts, and/or attempting or completing suicide or homicide. Children and teenagers are particularly vulnerable to this rare possibility. However, when considering this risk, it is imperative to consider the risk of the possibly serious outcomes that can result from untreated depression. While some of the best-known alternative remedies continue to be studied to see how well they work, there remains little evidence that herbal supplements effectively treat moderate to severe clinical depression. Medical professionals are often hesitant to recommend herbs or dietary supplements to treat depression, particularly in children, because the FDA doesn't regulate them (as prescription drugs are) to ensure their purity, quality, and effectiveness."
What are complications of depression in children?,"'Depression during childhood puts sufferers at risk for developing a number of other mental health issues. Children with depression are also more likely to have poor academic performance and to engage in ''alcohol'' and other ''drug abuse''. As adults, people who had depression during childhood and adolescence are at risk for having trouble maintaining employment, as well as family and other social disruptions during adulthood.' "
What is the prognosis for depression in children?,"'Depression can be chronic, in that 85% of people who have one episode of the disorder will have another one within 15 years of the first episode. Depressed individuals exposed to trauma are less likely to respond to treatment with antidepressant medication than those who have not experienced trauma. Young people with depression are more likely to develop severe ''mental illness'' during adulthood compared to children who do not suffer from depression. Depression is the leading cause of disability in the United States for people over 5 years of age, particularly for females. Childhood depression is a risk factor for a number of potentially negative outcomes, like academic and interpersonal problems, as well as issues with drugs and attempting suicide and engaging in other forms of self-harm. Since early treatment of childhood depression improves the prognosis, improving access to care (including encouraging parents and other family members to seek mental health treatment for their child) promotes a better prognosis.' "
Is it possible to prevent depression in children?,"""For children, from infancy through the teenage years, strong, healthy parent-child attachment can help protect the child from developing depression. Parental behaviors that tend to foster health attachment with their children involve consistent love and care, as well as attentive responsiveness to the child's needs, including age-appropriate steps toward the child's gradual independence.""""Preventing depression in childhood tends to involve addressing risk factors, both specific and nonspecific, strengthening other protective factors, and using an appropriate approach for the child's developmental level. Such programs often use cognitive behavioral and/or interpersonal approaches, as well as family based prevention strategies because research shows that these interventions are the most effective.""""Protective factors for adolescent depression include involving supportive adults, strong family and peer relationships, healthy coping skills, and emotional regulation. Children of a depressed parent tend to be more resilient when the child is more able to focus on age-appropriate tasks in their lives and on their relationships, as well as being able to understand their parents' condition. For depressed parents, their children seem to be less likely to develop the disorder when the parent is able to demonstrate a commitment to ""'parenting'' and to relationships.' "

"How does depression in the elderly differ from 
depression in younger 
adults?","'Depression impacts older people differently than younger people. In the elderly, depression often occurs with other medical illnesses and disabilities and lasts longer.'""Depression in the elderly often increases their risk of cardiac diseases. Depression doubles an elderly person's risk of cardiac diseases and increases their risk of death from illness. At the same time, depression reduces an elderly person's ability to rehabilitate. Studies of ""'nursing'' home patients with physical illnesses have shown that the presence of depression substantially increases the likelihood of death from those illnesses. Depression also has been associated with increased risk of death following a ''heart attack''. For that reason, making sure that an elderly person you are concerned about is evaluated and treated is important, even if the depression is mild.''Depression also increases the risk of ''suicide'', especially elderly white men. The ''suicide'' rate in people ages 80 to 84 is more than twice that of the general population. The National Institute of ''Mental Health'' considers depression in people age 65 and older to be a major public health problem.'""In addition, advancing age is often accompanied by loss of social support systems due to the death of a spouse or siblings, retirement, or relocation of residence. Because of changes in an elderly person's circumstances and the fact that elderly people are expected to slow down, doctors and family may miss the signs of depression. As a result, effective treatment often gets delayed, forcing many elderly people unnecessarily struggle with depression."" "
How is insomnia related to depression in the elderly?,"'''Insomnia'' is usually a symptom of depression.

"What 
treatments are available for depression 
in the elderly?","'There are several treatment options available for depression. They include medicine, psychotherapy or counseling, or ''electroconvulsive therapy''. Sometimes, a combination of these treatments may be used.' "
How do antidepressants relieve depression in the elderly?,"'    Most of the available ''antidepressants'' are believed to be equally effective in elderly adults. But the risk of side effects or potential reactions with other medicines must be carefully considered. For example, certain older antidepressants such as ''amitriptyline'' and ''imipramine'' can be sedating or cause a sudden drop in ''blood pressure'' when a person stands up. That can lead to falls and ''fractures''.''Antidepressants may take longer to start working in older people than they do in younger people. Since elderly people are more sensitive to medicines, doctors may prescribe lower doses at first. In general, the length of treatment for depression in the elderly is longer than it is in younger patients.' "
Can psychotherapy help relieve depression in the elderly?,"'    Most ''depressed'' people find that support from family and friends, involvement in self-help and support groups, and psychotherapy are helpful. Psychotherapy is especially beneficial for those who prefer not to take medicine and who have mild to moderate symptoms. It also is helpful for people who cannot take drugs because of side effects, interactions with other medicines, or other medical illnesses.''Psychotherapy in older adults can address a broad range of functional and social consequences of depression. Many doctors recommend the use of psychotherapy in combination with ''antidepressant'' medicines.' "
"When 
is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) used?","'''ECT'' can play an important role in the treatment of depression in older adults. When older patients are unable to take traditional antidepressant medicines because of side effects or interactions with other medications, or when depression is very severe and interferes with basic daily functioning (such as eating, bathing and grooming), ECT is often a safe and effective treatment alternative.' "
"What problems affect treatment of depression in the 
elderly?","'The stigma attached to ''mental illness'' and psychiatric treatment is even more powerful among the elderly than among younger people. This stigma can keep elderly people from acknowledging that they are depressed, even to themselves. Elderly people and their families sometimes also may wrongly misidentify depression symptoms as ""normal"" reactions to life stresses, losses, or the ''aging'' process.''Also, depression may be expressed through physical complaints rather than traditional symptoms. This delays appropriate treatment. In addition, depressed older people may not report their depression because they believe there is no hope for help.''Elderly people may also be unwilling to take their medicines because of side effects or cost. In addition, having certain other illnesses at the same time as depression can interfere with the effectiveness of antidepressant medicines. ''Alcoholism'"" and abuse of other substances may cause or worsen depression and interfere with effective treatment. And unhappy life events including the death of family or friends, poverty, and isolation may also affect the person's motivation to continue with treatment.""'WebMD Medical Reference' "

Specialists who treat de Quervain's tenosynovitis include orthopedic surgeons, sports-medicine doctors, and ""'rheumatologists'"". Occupational therapists and physical therapists can be involved in the care of patients with de Quervain's tenosynovitis."" "
What is the treatment for de Quervain's tenosynovitis?,"""Treatments for de Quervain's tenosynovitis includes any combination of rest, splinting, ice, anti-inflammation medication, and/or ""'cortisone injection''. Cortisone injection is extremely effective and is generally the optimal treatment. Normal activity may be resumed within three weeks after an injection. Surgery to release the tendon sheath is only rarely necessary and usually reserved for persisting inflammation after failure of at least one cortisone injection.'  "
Are there home remedies for de Quervain's tenosynovitis?,"""De Quervain's tenosynovitis can initially be treated with home remedies, including ""'cold'' packs, resting, and ''over-the-counter'' medications, such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil'') and ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''). Care must be taken to avoid reinjuring the strained tendon at the wrist. For example, young mothers must be very careful about lifting their children without straining the involved side of the wrist.' "
What is the prognosis with de Quervain's tenosynovitis?,"""The prognosis for de Quervain's tenosynovitis is excellent. The patient can generally return to full function after the inflammation quiets down with treatment. Sometimes bracing is used during future activities that involve repetitive wrist motion."" "
Is it possible to prevent de Quervain's tenosynovitis?,"""De Quervain's tenosynovitis can be prevented by avoiding activities that ""'stress'' the wrist and avoiding repetitive motion injuries.' "
What are dermabrasion and microdermabrasion?,"'Dermabrasion produces substantial changes in the appearance of the skin by injuring it in a controlled manner using an abrasive. Dermabrasion is most often used to treat certain types of scarring and aged skin. Other options that produce similar results include laser surgery, moderate to deep skin peels, and the injection of fillers. Most often the facial skin is treated, but skin at any site can be treated. Dermabrasion is performed by dermatologists and ''plastic'' surgeons.''Microdermabrasion'' is a nonsurgical technique that affects only the superficial dead layer of the skin, producing transient changes. Microdermabrasion is often administered by nonphysician professionals.' "
Who is a candidate for dermabrasion and microdermabrasion?,"'Dermabrasion produces controlled skin damage involving the deeper layers of the skin. The resulting ''wound'' heals with a ''scar'' that is cosmetically superior to what was there originally. The conditions that seem to respond best to this approach include ''acne'' scarring, traumatic ''scars'', ''rhinophyma'' (nose enlargement in ''rosacea''), ''wrinkles'', ''tattoo removal'', and ''actinic keratoses'' (very early stage of ''skin cancer'').''Currently, there are other available modalities, including laser surgery, which are more popular and probably more effective because they seem to be more controllable. Lighter-skinned individuals generally get more reliable results because they are less likely to develop increased pigmentation after the procedure. Patients who have recently been treated with ''isotretinoin'' (Accutane) should avoid dermabrasion for at least six months.''Microdermabrasion is a technique that affects only the most superficial layer of the skin, the stratum corneum. This layer is composed of dead horny cells that are exfoliated by this procedure. This procedure is safe for most people because it should not produce any significant damage to the skin. Patients who have an active skin disease such as ''acne'' should not receive treatment to the affected skin.' "
What is the difference between a dermabrasion vs. microdermabrasion procedure?,"'Since dermabrasion is a surgical procedure, local anesthesia is required and is occasionally supplemented by intravenous sedation. When the skin is appropriately numb, an abrasive device is applied to the skin. This device could be a rapidly rotating wire brush or a diamond encrusted wheel or even abrasive screening. The choice depends on the anatomical location as well as the particular area to be treated. A refrigerant spray is often used to reduce the movement of the skin during the procedure. The ability to perform this procedure is very dependent on the skill and experience of the operator.''Microdermabrasion involves spraying an inert crystalline material or rubbing a so-called crystalline impregnated wand with sufficient force to dislodge superficial skin cells without damaging the deeper layers of living cells. Aside from this superficial debridement, it produces mild inflammation and temporary swelling.' "
What specialists perform dermabrasion and microdermabrasion?,'Dermatologists and plastic surgeons are most likely to perform dermabrasions. Microdermabrasion requires no specific expertise.' 
What is the recovery like after dermabrasion and microdermabrasion?,"'The wound produced by dermabrasion, like any other wound, must be kept clean and moist. Gentle removal of crust and debris can occur after removal of the postoperative dressing (usually 24-48 hours after the procedure). Petroleum jelly is generally applied to the wound surface frequently. Healing usually occurs within 10 days and redness dwindles after three to six weeks.''Since microdermabrasion does not produce a wound, there is no postoperative issues aside from mild redness. Over the short term, there may be some subtle decrease in wrinkling due to the swelling.' "
What are the side effects of dermabrasion and microdermabrasion?,"'As with any surgical procedure, infections can occur and these are treated with antibiotics. Undesirable color is more common in darkly pigmented individuals. ''Keloids'' and hypertrophic scars can occur, especially in patients with a genetic predisposition to scar.''Microdermabrasion has few side effects, but it is best avoided if you are taking isotretinoin.' "
Does insurance cover the cost of dermabrasion and microdermabrasion?,"'Since both of these procedures are almost always cosmetic, insurance coverage is usually not available.' "
Who's A Candidate For Micropigmentation?,"'Do you want to improve the appearance of thin eyebrows or lips? Do you have an uneven hairline or ''allergies'"" to make-up that create a problem? Micropigmentation may be a viable solution. It's not going to provide a perfect world, but it can help enhance certain features."" "

He or she will evaluate your skin for tone, texture and complexion in order to best match your natural colors with the proper pigment. He or she also may take photos."" "
"How Is Micropigmentation 
Done?","'Typically, micropigmentation can be performed in an office setting. The procedure will be performed with a pen-like instrument or standard ''tattoo'' gun. Your doctor or specialist will wear medical gloves when performing the procedure. The procedure itself will take a short amount of time, perhaps 20 minutes to a half hour at most.''If you are receiving anesthesia, you will be required to arrive earlier in order to let the anesthesia take effect. After the procedure, your specialist or doctor will provide you with an antiseptic to cleanse the treated region.' "
What Should I Expect After the Procedure?,"'You will be sent home the same day. You should expect swelling in the treated region. Your doctor or specialist will instruct you on how often you should ice the area and what type of ointment you can apply to the area.''If you are having the procedure performed in your eye region, you should plan to have someone drive you to the office and home again.You may experience tearing, which is normal.''The pigmentation typically will appear darker in the weeks following the procedure, but will fade over time.'""Follow your doctor's instructions on what to avoid (such as peroxide) or sunlight.

What is jet lag?,"'Jet lag, also called desynchronosis and flight ''fatigue'', is a temporary disorder that causes ''fatigue'', ''insomnia'', and other symptoms as a result of air travel across multiple time zones. It is considered a ''circadian rhythm'' ''sleep'' disorder, which is a disruption of the internal circadian\xa0clock.' "
What are other symptoms and signs of jet lag?,"'Besides travel\xa0''fatigue'' and ''insomnia'', a jet lag sufferer may experience a number of physical and emotional symptoms, including ''anxiety'', ''constipation'', ''diarrhea'', ''confusion'', ''dehydration'', ''headache'', irritability, ''nausea'', ''indigestion'', ''difficulty concentrating'', ''sweating'', coordination problems, ''dizziness'', daytime sleepiness, malaise (a general feeling of being unwell), and even ''memory loss''. Some individuals report additional symptoms, such as heartbeat irregularities and increased susceptibility to illness.''Children and ''babies'' can also suffer the same jet lag symptoms as adults.''Generally, people do not need a medical evaluation for a diagnosis of jet lag. If you have traveled across several time zones and feel the symptoms associated with jet lag, you likely have it. If your symptoms of jet lag are severe, do not go away after a few days, or you have any other concerns, see a doctor.'  "
How long does it take to recover from jet lag?,"'Recovering from jet lag depends on the number of time zones crossed while traveling. In general, the body will adjust to the new time zone at the rate of one or two time zones per day. For example, if you crossed six time zones, the body will typically adjust to this time change in three to five days.''Jet lag is temporary, so the prognosis is excellent and most people will recover within a few days.''Complications of jet lag are extremely rare. If a person has a preexisting ''heart'' condition, the ''stress'' of the disruption in the circadian rhythm, combined with the ''stress'' of travel, the high altitude, and immobility during flight may result in a ''heart attack''. If the jet lag results in chronic ''sleep'' deprivation, ''stroke'' may occur in certain predisposed individuals.' "
What is a time zone?,"'The definition of a time zone is a geographical region which has the same time everywhere within it. The world has 24 time zones, one for each hour in the day. Each zone runs from north to south in strips that are approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) wide. (The actual width of each zone varies to accommodate political and geographical boundaries.) As the earth rotates, dawn occurs at a set hour in one time zone, then an hour later in the time zone immediately to the west and so on through the 24-hour cycle. Thus, in the U.S., when it is 6 a.m. in the Eastern Time zone, it is 5 a.m. in the central zone, 4 a.m. in the mountain zone, and 3 a.m. in the Pacific zone.' "
"What 
causes jet lag?","'The cause of jet lag is the inability of the body of a ''traveler'' to immediately adjust to the time in a different zone. Thus, when a New Yorker arrives in Paris at midnight Paris time, his or her body continues to operate on New York time. As the body struggles to cope with the new schedule, temporary ''insomnia'', fatigue, irritability, and an impaired ability to concentrate may set in. The changed bathroom schedule may cause ''constipation'' or ''diarrhea'', and the brain may become confused and disoriented as it attempts to juggle schedules.' "
How does the body keep time?,"'Our bodies have a sort of internal biological clock that follows a 24-hour cycle, called a circadian rhythm. A tiny part of the brain called the hypothalamus acts like an alarm clock to activate various body functions such as hunger, ''thirst'', and sleep. It also regulates body temperature, ''blood pressure'', and the level of hormones and glucose in the bloodstream. To help the body tell the time of day, fibers in the ''optic nerve'' of the eye transmit perceptions of light and darkness to a timekeeping center within the hypothalamus. So, when the eye of an air ''traveler'' perceives dawn or dusk many hours earlier or later than usual, the hypothalamus may trigger activities that the rest of the body is not ready for, and jet lag occurs.' "
Does the direction of travel matter?,"'Yes. ''Travelers'' flying north or south in the same time zone typically experience the fewest problems because the time of day always remains the same as in the place where the flight originated. These ''travelers'' may experience discomfort, but this usually results from confinement in an airplane for a long time or from differences in climate, culture, and ''diet'' at the new location. Time differences do not play a role.''Travelers flying east, on the other hand, typically experience the most problems because they ""lose"" time. For example, on an international flight from Washington, D.C., to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, a traveler loses eight hours. Meals, sleep, bowel habits, and other daily routines are all pushed ahead eight hours.''Travelers flying west ""gain"" time and usually have an easier time adjusting than eastward travelers. However, they too experience symptoms of jet lag after landing because they still must adjust to a different schedule.'  "
Do the symptoms of jet lag vary in intensity?,"'Yes. People flying across only one or two time zones may be able to adjust without noticeable effects of the time change. Those flying across three or more time zones will likely develop noticeable symptoms of jet lag. Generally, the intensity of symptoms varies in relation to the number of time zones crossed and the direction of travel. People also vary in their susceptibility to jet lag symptoms and the severity of the symptoms.' "
What are risk factors for jet lag?,"'The main cause of jet lag is travel across different time zones. However, there are certain risk factors that may result in symptoms being more severe or longer-lasting.' Travel across three or more time zones: Most people can adjust rapidly to a one or two time zone change. Three or more may cause more noticeable symptoms of jet lag. Flying east: As stated previously, travel from west to east causes travelers to ""lose"" time, and this can be a more difficult adjustment. Age: Older adults may recover from jet lag more slowly. Frequent travel: Pilots, flight attendants, and frequent business travelers who are constantly in different time zones may have difficulty adjusting. Preexisting conditions: Preexisting sleep deprivation, stress, and poor sleep habits prior to travel can exacerbate jet lag symptoms. Flight conditions: The monotony of travel, immobility and cramped seating, airline food, altitude, and cabin pressure can impact jet lag symptoms. Alcohol use: Overconsumption of alcohol during long flights can also worsen the symptoms of jet lag."
Are there any remedies for jet lag? Is it possible to prevent jet lag?,"'There are several home remedies that can help with ''prevention'' of jet lag and easier recovery from the symptoms. The following are 12 tips to help travelers to avoid or to minimize the effects of jet lag.''If you are in good physical condition, stay that way. In other words, long before you embark, continue to ''exercise'', eat right, and get plenty of rest. Your physical stamina and conditioning will enable you to cope better after you land. If you are not physically fit, or have a poor ''diet'', begin shaping up and eating right several weeks before your trip.''If you have a medical condition that requires monitoring (such as ''diabetes'' or ''heart disease'""), consult your physician well in advance of your departure to plan a coping strategy that includes medication schedules and doctor's appointments, if necessary, in the destination time zone.""'If your stay in the destination time zone will last more than a few days, begin adjusting your body to the new time zone before you leave. For example, if you are traveling from the U.S. to Europe for a one-month vacation, set your daily routine back an hour or more three to four weeks before departure. Then, set it back another hour the following week and the week after that. Easing into the new schedule gradually in familiar surroundings will save your body the ''shock'' of adjusting all at once.'""If you are traveling east, try going to sleep earlier and getting up and out into the early morning sun. If traveling west, try to get at least an hour's worth of sunlight as soon as possible after reaching your destination.""'There are online jet lag calculators that can help you figure out how much and when to reset your sleep schedule to help you adjust to a time change before you depart.''Do not drink alcoholic ''beverages'' the day before your flight, during your flight, or the day after your flight. These beverages can cause ''dehydration'', disrupt sleeping schedules, and trigger ''nausea'' and general discomfort.''Likewise, do not drink ''caffeinated'' beverages before, during, or just after the flight. ''Caffeine'"" can also cause dehydration and disrupt sleeping schedules. What's more, ""'caffeine'' can rattle your nerves and intensify any travel ''anxiety'' you may already be feeling.''Drink plenty of water, especially during the flight, to counteract the effects of the dry atmosphere inside the plane. Take your own extra water aboard the airplane if allowed.''While seated during your flight, ''exercise'' your legs from time to time. Move them up and down and back and forth. Bend your knees. Stand up and sit down. Every hour or two, get up and walk around. Do not take sleeping pills, and do not nap for more than an hour at a time.''These measures have a twofold purpose. First, they reduce your risk of developing a ''blood clot'' in the legs. Research shows that long periods of sitting can slow blood movement in and to the legs, thereby increasing the risk of a clot. The seat is partly to blame. It presses against the veins in the leg, restricting blood flow. Inactivity also plays a role. It slows the movement of blood through veins. If a clot forms, it sometimes breaks loose and travels to the ''lungs'' (known as ''pulmonary embolism''), lodges in an artery, and inhibits blood flow. The victim may experience ''pain'' and ''breathing'' problems and ''cough'' up blood. If the clot is large, the victim could die. Second, remaining active, even in a small way, revitalizes and refreshes your body, wards off ''stiffness'', and promotes mental alertness which can ease the symptoms of jet lag.''On long flights traveling across eight, 10, or even 12 time zones, break up your trip, if feasible, with a stay in a city about halfway to your destination. For example, if you are traveling from New York to Bombay, India, schedule a stopover of a few days in Dublin or Paris. (At noon in New York, it is 5 p.m. in Dublin, 6 p.m. in Paris, and 10:30 p.m. in Bombay.)''On a long trip, how you feel is more important than how you look. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. Avoid items that pinch, restrict, or chafe. When selecting your trip outfit, keep in mind the climate in your destination time zone. Dress for your destination.''Upon arrival, if you are staying at a hotel, check to see that beds and bathroom facilities are satisfactory and that cooling and heating systems are in good working order. If the room is unsuitable, ask for another.''The sooner you adapt to the local schedule, the quicker your body will adjust. Therefore, if you arrive at noon local time (but 6 a.m. your time), eat lunch, not breakfast. During the day, expose your body to sunlight by taking walks or sitting in outdoor cafés. The sunlight will cue your hypothalamus to reduce the production of sleep-inducing ''melatonin'' during the day, thereby initiating the process of resetting your internal clock.''When traveling with children and babies, try to get them on the local schedule as well. When traveling east (you will lose time), try to keep the child awake until the local bedtime. If traveling west when you will gain time, wake your child up at the local time.'""Try to establish sleeping patterns without resorting to pills. However, if you have difficulty sleeping on the first two or three nights, it's OK to take a mild sedative if your physician has prescribed one. But wean yourself off the sedative as soon as possible. Otherwise, it could become habit-forming.""'Valerian'' root is an herb that can be used as treatment for insomnia. Do not take valerian with alcohol. It is important to consult your physician before taking these or any other herbal remedy.''Sleep medications are not recommended for children.'  "
What is the treatment for jet lag?,"'The best way to treat jet lag is to take measures to prevent it. But you may still feel jet lagged when traveling across many time zones, even with some preventive measures. Treatment to cure jet lag involves some of the home remedies discussed.'""When you arrive at your destination, try to adapt to the local schedule as soon as possible. For example, if you arrive at 6 p.m. local time (but noon your time), eat dinner, not lunch. If your normal bedtime at home is 11 p.m., go to bed at 11 p.m. local time (even if it's only 5 p.m. at home). Get as much exposure to sunshine during the day as possible to help reset your internal ""'body clock''.''Once you arrive at your destination, a small dose of caffeine, such as from your morning coffee, may help jolt you awake for a few hours. Caffeine is best reserved for the early part of the day because it can keep you awake at night if taken too late.'  "
Are there effective medications for jet lag? What is the role of melatonin in jet lag?,"'There are no specific medications for jet lag, only medications that may help you get to sleep more easily when you reach your destination, or that remedy some symptoms of jet lag.''Melatonin is a hormone that plays a key role in body rhythms and jet lag. After the sun sets, the eyes perceive darkness and alert the hypothalamus to begin releasing melatonin, which promotes sleep. Conversely, when the eyes perceive sunlight, they tell the hypothalamus to withhold melatonin production. However, the hypothalamus cannot readjust its schedule instantly; it takes several days.''A dose of melatonin that is between 0.3 mg-5 mg may be taken on the first day you travel at the time you go to sleep at your destination, and for a few days, if needed. Melatonin seems to be most effective when crossing five or more time zones, or traveling east. Melatonin should only be taken by adults. Do not drink alcohol when taking melatonin. Consult a doctor if you plan on taking melatonin.''Prescription or ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) sleeping pills may help you reset your body clock to the time at your destination. Try not to use them if possible, but if your doctor has prescribed sleep medication, it may be taken if needed for up to two or three nights. Try not to take it for longer, as these medications can be habit-forming.''OTC ''sleep aids'' include''Prescription sleep medications include the following:'   diphenhydramine (Sominex, Nytol) and doxylamine (Unisom). Short-acting sedative-hypnotics (non-benzodiazepines): zolpidem (Ambien, ZolpiMist), zaleplon (Sonata), and eszopiclone (Lunesta) Melatonin receptor agonists: ramelteon (Rozerem) Benzodiazepines (tranquilizers): flurazepam (Dalmane), temazepam (Restoril), and estazolam (ProSom)"
Why test a child's hearing?,"'A child with undetected hearing loss may not be able to develop normal speech and language or acquire the cognitive abilities (knowing, thinking, and judging) needed for learning. Children whose hearing loss is not identified until, for example, 2 or 3 years of age may suffer from permanent impairment of speech, language, and learning.'' The early identification of hearing loss permits the initiation of treatment and rehabilitation of the hearing-impaired child at a very young age. The child can then learn more normal speech skills when hearing loss is identified early and intervention begins.'""Hearing loss can range from a mild impairment to profound loss. Many people think that hearing is only graded as normal or deaf. They may also think that the child is hearing normally if he or she is responding to sounds and voices. However, there are many subtle gradations between normal hearing and deafness and a child's hearing loss may not be apparent.""'For example, it is common for a child with moderate hearing loss to develop speech and language and yet miss over half of what is being said. A child in this situation will have a distinct disadvantage in development and learning and will often reach a point where advancement stops unless the hearing loss is detected and treatment begins.''The ''stress'' on a child with hearing loss (and their family) can be enormous because the child does not understand why it is constant struggle to learn seemingly simple material (and the family is baffled as to why their bright child is not doing well).''The degree of hearing loss often determines the impact it will have on the child throughout life. However, with early identification and treatment, the impact can be lessened.' "
"What are the causes, risk factors, and signs of hearing loss in children?","""There are a number of risk factors for hearing loss in children, so there are a number of special reasons why a child's hearing may need to be screened or tested. Common indications for a hearing evaluation include""'In addition, the circumstances surrounding the ''pregnancy'' and birth may be associated with subsequent hearing loss. If there is a history that includes any of the following, a child should have a hearing assessment.''Some parents start to suspect that their child cannot hear normally because the child does not respond to his or her name consistently or asks for words, phrases, or sentences to be repeated. Another sign can be that the child does not seem to be paying attention to sounds or to what is being said.''On the average, only half of all children diagnosed with a hearing loss actually have a known risk factor for hearing loss. This means that the cause is never known in about half of children with hearing loss. For this reason, all states in the U.S. have instituted a universal hearing screen so that all ''babies'' have their hearing screened before they go home from the newborn nursery.'  speech delay, frequent or recurrent ear infections, a family history of hearing loss (hearing loss can be inherited), syndromes known to be associated with hearing loss (for example, Down syndrome, the Alport syndrome, and Crouzon syndrome), infectious diseases that cause hearing loss (for example, meningitis, measles, and cytomegalovirus [CMV] infection), medical treatments that may have hearing loss as a side effect, including some antibiotics and some chemotherapy agents, poor school performance, and diagnosis of a learning disability or other disorder, such as autism or
pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). low birth weight (less than 2 pounds) and/or prematurity assisted ventilation (to help with breathing for more than 10 days after birth) low Apgar scores (numbers assigned at birth that reflect the newborn's health status) severe jaundice after birth  maternal illness during pregnancy (for example, German measles [rubella]) hydrocephalus"
Who tests hearing in children?,"""A specialist who tests a person's hearing is called an audiologist. An audiologist has an advanced degree (minimum of master's degree) in diagnostic hearing testing techniques and auditory rehabilitation for children and adults. However, because testing hearing in children requires specific equipment, setup, and training, not all audiologists test children. When a child is referred for a hearing evaluation, it should be confirmed at the time of scheduling that the testing audiologist has a pediatric specialty and the appropriate setup to test hearing in children."" "
Can very young children have their hearing tested?,"""A child of any age can be tested with the appropriate hearing test. The type of test utilized depends on the child's age in years or developmental level. Some hearing tests require no behavioral response from the child, while other tests utilize games that entice a child's interest. The key is to find the right test method for each child."" "
How is hearing tested in an older infant or young child who cannot follow specific instructions?,"'Cooperative and alert infants or young children (ages 5 months to 2 and a half years) are frequently tested using a method called visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA). For this test, the child sits on a ''caregiver'""'s lap in the center of a room.""'''Speakers are situated to the child\'s right and left side. The speakers have toys (usually mounted inside boxes) hung below, which can be animated by the tester. The child is then ""conditioned"" to turn his or her head toward the side from which the sound is presented. When the child turns to the correct side, the toy is lit up, providing positive reinforcement that encourages the child to continue participating in the task. Children (and adults) will instinctively turn toward a novel sound without having to think about the response, which is why this test is effective for children as young as 5 months of age. This method can also be used with small insert earphones, which allow the hearing of each ear to be tested individually. Below is a diagram of the setup for the VRA test.''There are, however, some limitations to the VRA test. For an accurate test, the child must participate and needs to be cooperative and alert. Additionally, if only speakers are used for testing, the results can only be used to predict hearing for the ""better"" ear. There is no way to tell if both ears are hearing the test sounds, or if only one ear is hearing all of the sounds, unless a device is utilized to isolate the ears (for example, earphones). It is not unusual, however, to achieve test results for individual ear information by having the child wear earphones during portions of the VRA test. The ability to localize sound even with one impaired ear can be quite good. Often, otoacoustic emission (OAE) tests are completed in conjunction with VRA testing to obtain some ear-specific results (OAE tests will be discussed later in this article).''Children 3-5 years of age who are capable of more complicated tasks are often tested using a technique called play audiometry, in which sounds are paired with a specific response or task. For example, a child is taught to hold a peg next to his or her cheek. When the child hears the sound, the child places the peg on a Peg-Board.'''""Speech testing can be completed using pictures, for example, the child points to the correct picture as the tester's voice is presented at softer and softer levels. Once again, the child needs to be a willing participant. The advantage of this format is that results obtained are often as detailed as an adult test session."" "
How can hearing be assessed in a child who is unable to cooperate?,"""Some children are unable to cooperate for hearing evaluations, either due to their age or to a developmental delay (for example, a child with severe mental retardation). Currently, there are two different types of tests that are utilized for children who are unable to cooperate. The first is the frequency-specific auditory brainstem response (ABR) evaluation. An ABR is a physiological measure of the brainstem's response to sound. It tests the integrity of the hearing system from the ear to the brainstem. The test is performed by placing four to five electrodes on the child's head, after which a variety of sounds are presented to the child through small earphones. As the hearing nerve fires, the sound stimulus travels up to the brain. The electrical activity generated by the nerve can be recorded by the electrodes and presented as waveforms on a computer screen. The audiologist can then present different loudness levels of each sound and determine the softest levels at which the child can hear. The child can be tested using all the sounds of a conventional hearing evaluation (adult hearing evaluation).""'The limitation of the ABR is the need for the child to be quiet and still. The electrical potential the computer is recording from the auditory nerve is very small. Any muscle movement, including something as small as an eye blink, can obliterate the hearing response; therefore, the infant or child must be sleeping during the test. Infants less than 3 months old can be tested during natural ''sleep''. Children older than 3 months are typically sedated for about one hour (under the supervision of a physician) during the test. The most common oral sedative used is ''chloral hydrate''.'""The second type of test to objectively evaluate children is the otoacoustic emission (OAE) test. This test can be done as a supplement to the ABR or as an initial screen of hearing. An otoacoustic emission test measures an acoustic response produced by the inner ear (cochlea). The acoustic response measured is in essence the response produced by the inner ear as it bounces back out of the ear in response to a sound stimulus. The test is performed by placing a small probe that contains a microphone and speaker into the child's ear.""'As the child sits or rests quietly, sounds are generated in the probe and responses that come back from the cochlea are recorded. Once the cochlea processes the sound, an electrical stimulus is sent to the brainstem. In addition, there is a second and separate sound that does not travel up the nerve but comes back out into the child\'s ear canal. This ""byproduct"" is the otoacoustic emission. The emission is then recorded with the microphone probe and represented pictorially on a computer screen. The audiologist can tell which sounds yielded a response/emission and the strength of those responses. If there is an emission present for those sounds critical to speech comprehension, then the child has ""passed"" the hearing screen. As a supplement to the ABR, the OAE serves as a crosscheck to either confirm normal hearing or verify the site-of-lesion for the hearing loss as the inner ear. OAE tests the integrity of the hearing organ for sound (the cochlea), but it does not evaluate the hearing beyond the cochlea. That is why the OAE is often paired with the ABR or with a behavioral test that can evaluate a child\'s responsiveness to sound.'""The results from an ABR and an OAE evaluation can predict the child's hearing, determine if there is a loss, determine the type of hearing loss, and help with decisions regarding intervention. Intervention can include medical treatment, surgery, or hearing aids and therapy."" "
Are any additional tests done during a pediatric hearing evaluation?,"'A thorough diagnostic test also includes an evaluation of the middle-ear system. The middle ear is the space behind the eardrum and is a common site for ''ear infections'' in children.''A tympanogram is a measure of the compliance of the middle-ear system mobility (including the eardrum) and is an objective method for confirming abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear space, such as''The tympanogram is completed by inserting a probe in the ear and creating a vacuum-tight seal. The air pressure is changed in the ear canal from positive to negative, and the movement of the eardrum is recorded. The amount and shape of the movement can either exclude or signify different problems, as previously listed. The test is fast, objective, and is not painful (although sometimes the insertion of the probe may upset children).'""When a loud sound is presented to a healthy ear, the eardrum will contract, a sort of built-in hearing protection mechanism (although it's not very effective). This contraction of the eardrum is called the acoustic reflex. The absence of this reflex can further confirm problems of the middle ear or may help to identify or confirm a hearing loss. Acoustic reflexes are typically evaluated concurrent with the tympanogram.""'Many general pediatricians perform this test in their offices as a screening test and to aid in the diagnosis of ear infections or effusions (fluid in the middle ear space).' fluid behind the eardrum, a hole or perforation of the eardrum, or stiffness of eardrum or middle-ear bones (for example, otosclerosis)."
What happens when hearing loss is detected?  What is the treatment for hearing loss in children?,"'When hearing loss is identified, a thorough search for its cause must be undertaken. In many situations, the hearing loss can be attributed to an ''ear infection'' or to fluid trapped in the middle-ear space. In this situation, the pediatrician can often prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection. If the infection is persistent, or the hearing loss is still present after treatment of the infection, then the child should be referred to a medical doctor who specializes in diseases of the ear and auditory system (an otolaryngologist or ENT). The otolaryngologist will often administer further testing, and in some situations, he or she may recommend additional therapy such as surgery (''ear tubes''). If the hearing loss is persistent or is related to a nerve or inner-ear problem, the otolaryngologist will often recommend an evaluation by an audiologist for hearing aids and rehabilitative therapy (which includes speech therapy and social integration of the hearing-impaired child).' "
What is the latest hearing test being used in children?,"""One of the newest tests being utilized is the auditory steady state response (ASSR) evaluation. This is a test that is used in conjunction with the ABR. It is completed while the child is sleeping, or sedated, and it makes recordings from the auditory nerve as the response travels up to the brainstem. The generators for this test are commonly accepted to be similar to those of the ABR. One advantage of ASSR is that the stimuli used to test the child's hearing are more frequency-specific, which allows the audiologist to predict hearing levels for a wide range of sounds with increased accuracy. In addition, the ASSR is faster and has the ability to test at levels somewhat louder than the ABR (due to equipment limitations of the ABR), making the distinction between severe and profound losses more clear. It should be noted, however, that results for a mild hearing loss and normal hearing are indistinguishable from each other, so there is potential for a misdiagnosis for children with mild hearing loss."" "
Introduction to pervasive developmental disorders,"'The term ""pervasive development disorders,"" also called PDDs, refers to a group of conditions that involve delays in the development of many basic skills, most notably the ability to socialize with others, to communicate, and to use imagination. Children with these conditions often are confused in their thinking and generally have problems understanding the world around them.'""Because these conditions typically are identified in children around 3 years of age -- a critical period in a child's development -- they are called development disorders. Although the condition begins far earlier than 3 years of age, parents often do not notice a problem until the child is a toddler who is not ""'walking'', talking, or developing as well as other children of the same age.' "
What Conditions Are Considered Pervasive Development Disorders?,"'There are five types of pervasive development disorders:' Autism: Children with autism have problems with social interaction, pretend play, and communication. They also have a limited range of activities and interests. Many (nearly 75%) of children with autism also have some degree of mental retardation. Asperger's syndrome: Like children with autism, children with Asperger's syndrome have difficulty with social interaction and communication, and have a narrow range of interests. However, children with Asperger's have average or above average intelligence, and develop normally in the areas of language and cognition (the mental processes related to thinking and learning). Children with Asperger's often also have difficulty concentrating and may have poor coordination. Childhood disintegrative disorder: Children with this rare condition begin their development normally in all areas, physical and mental. At some point, usually between 2 and 10 years of age, a child with this illness loses many of the skills he or she has developed. In addition to the loss of social and language skills, a child with disintegrative disorder may lose control of other functions, including bowel and bladder control. Rett's syndrome: Children with this very rare disorder have the symptoms associated with a PDD and also suffer problems with physical development. They generally suffer the loss of many motor or movement, skills -- such as walking and use of their hands -- and develop poor coordination. This condition has been linked to a defect on the X chromosome, so it almost always affects girls. Pervasive development disorder not otherwise specified (PDDNOS): This category is used to refer to children who have significant problems with communication and play, and some difficulty interacting with others, but are too social to be considered autistic."
What Are the Symptoms of Pervasive Development Disorders?,"'The use of the word ""pervasive"" to describe these illnesses is somewhat misleading. The definition of pervasive is ""to be present throughout,"" but children with PDDs generally do not have problems in all areas of functioning. Rather, most children with PDDs have specific problem areas and often function very well in other areas.''Children with PDDs, such as autism, can display a wide range of symptoms which can range in severity from mild to disabling. They also vary widely in their individual abilities, intelligence, and behavior.''General symptoms that may be present to some degree in a child with a PDD include:'   Difficulty with verbal communication, including problems using and understanding language. Difficulty with non-verbal communication, such as gestures and facial expressions. Difficulty with social interaction, including relating to people and to his or her surroundings. Unusual ways of playing with toys and other objects. Difficulty adjusting to changes in routine or familiar surroundings. Repetitive body movements or patterns of behavior, such as hand flapping, spinning and, head banging. Changing response to sound. (The child may be very sensitive to some noises and seem to not hear others.) Temper tantrums Difficulty sleeping Aggressive behavior Fearfulness or anxiety (nervousness)"
What Causes Pervasive Development Disorders?,"'The cause of pervasive development disorders is not known, but researchers are looking for answers. Some studies suggest that PDDs are caused by a problem with the nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Studies currently in progress are examining the structure and function of the brain in people with autism for clues that may help us better understand these conditions, as well as how to treat and/or prevent them.' "
How Common Are Pervasive Development Disorders?,"""It is estimated that pervasive development disorders occur in about five to 15 children per 10,000 births. In general, PDDs are more common in boys than in girls, with the exception of Rett's syndrome, which occurs almost always in girls."" "
How Are Pervasive Development Disorders Diagnosed?,"'If symptoms of a pervasive development disorder are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a complete medical history and physical exam. Although there are no laboratory tests to diagnose a PDD, the doctor may use various tests -- such as ''X-rays'' and blood tests -- to determine if there is a physical disorder causing the symptoms.''If no physical disorder is found, the child may be referred to a specialist in childhood development disorders, such as a child and adolescent psychiatrist or psychologist, pediatric ''neurologist'"", developmental pediatrician, or other health professionals who are specially trained to diagnose and treat PDDs. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis on the child's level of development, and the doctor's observation of the child's speech and behavior, including his or her play and ability to socialize with others. The doctor often seeks input from the child's parents, teachers, and other adults who are familiar with the child's symptoms."" "
How Are Pervasive Development Disorders Treated?,"""Because children with pervasive development disorders have a range of symptoms and abilities, a plan of therapy must be developed with the child's specific needs in mind. The treatment plan -- or more appropriately, a program of intervention -- will address the child's needs at home and at school. For that reason, intervention planning is a cooperative effort of the parents, health care providers, teachers, and others who may be needed to provide services, such as counselors, social workers and occupational, physical, or speech therapists. The plan aims to promote better socializing and communication, and reduce behaviors that can interfere with learning and functioning.""'A plan of care for a child with a PDD may include:' Special education: Education is structured to meet the child's unique educational needs. Behavior modification: This may include strategies for supporting positive behavior by the child. Speech, physical or occupational therapy: These therapies are designed to increase the child's functional abilities. Medication: There are no drugs to treat the PDDs themselves. Medications may be used, however, treating specific symptoms such as anxiety (nervousness), hyperactivity, and behavior may result in injury."
What Research Is Being Done on Pervasive Development Disorders?,"'Most of the research being done on pervasive development disorders focuses on learning more about the causes of these disorders, specifically what is going on in the brain. The goal is to use this knowledge to develop better techniques for diagnosing and treating these disorders, ultimately leading to ''prevention'' and cure.' "
What Is the Outlook for People with Pervasive Development Disorders?,"'The outlook varies depending on the type and severity of the pervasive development disorder, the age at which treatment is started, and the availability of supportive resources for the child. Most children with PDDs will continue to have some problems with communication and socialization, but many can experience a significant increase in function.' "
Can Pervasive Development Disorders Be Prevented?,"'Until more is known about the causes of pervasive development disorders, it is not possible to prevent them. However, the sooner a child with symptoms begins treatment, the better he or she will do in the long run.' "
What is child development?,"""A child's growth is more than just physical. Children grow, develop, and learn throughout their lives, starting at birth. A child's development can be followed by how they play, learn, speak, and behave."" "
What is a developmental delay? Will my child just grow out of it?,"'Skills such as taking a first step, smiling for the first time, and waving ""bye bye"" are called developmental milestones. Children reach milestones in playing, learning, speaking, behaving, and moving (crawling, ''walking'', etc.). A developmental delay is when your child does not reach these milestones at the same time as other children the same age. If your child is not developing properly, there are things you can do that may help. Most of the time, a developmental problem is not something your child will ""grow out of"" on his or her own. But with help, your child could reach his or her full potential!' "
What is developmental screening?,"""Doctors and nurses use developmental screening to tell if children are learning basic skills when they should, or if they might have problems. Your child's doctor may ask you questions or talk and play with your child during an exam to see how he or she learns, speaks, behaves, and moves. Since there is no lab or blood test to tell if your child may have a delay, the developmental screening will help tell if your child needs to see a specialist."" "
Why is developmental screening important?,"'When a developmental delay is not recognized early, children must wait to get the help they need. This can make it hard for them to learn when they start school. In the United States, 15 percent of children have a developmental or behavioral disability such as ''autism'', intellectual disability (also known as mental retardation), or Attention-Deficit/''Hyperactivity'' Disorder (''ADHD'').''In addition, many children have delays in language or other areas. But, less than half of children with problems are identified before starting school. During this time, the child could have received help for these problems and may even have entered school more ready to learn.' "
I have concerns that my child could have a developmental delay. Whom can I contact in my state to get a developmental assessment for my child?,"""Talk to your child's doctor or nurse if you have concerns about how your child is developing. If you or your doctor think there could be a problem, you can take your child to see a developmental pediatrician or other specialist, and you can contact your local early intervention agency (for children under 3) or public school (for children 3 and older) for help. To find out who to speak to in your area, you can contact the National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities by logging on to www.nichcy.org/states.htm. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and ""'Prevention'' (CDC) has links to information for families at (www.cdc.gov/actearly). If there is a problem, it is very important to get your child help as soon as possible.' "
How can I help my child's development?,"'Proper ''nutrition'', ''exercise'', and rest are very important for '""children's health""' and development. Providing a safe and loving home and spending time with your child - playing, singing, reading, and even just talking - can also make a big difference in his or her development.''For other ideas of activities to do with your child, and for child safety information, go to www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/child/ and look in the ""developmental milestones"" section.'

What is deviated septum?,"'The thin wall between the nostrils is made of cartilage and bone and is called the septum. The septum is made up of bone and cartilage. When this cartilage or bone is off-center (deviated to one side) or crooked, it is referred to as a deviated septum.' A deviated septum may be present at birth, may become crooked during growth, or maybe caused by injury to the nose and face. A deviated septum often does not have any symptoms, but some symptoms include difficulty breathing through the nose, nasal congestion, sinus infections, nosebleeds, sleep problems, headache, and postnasal drip. Some symptoms of deviated septum may be treated with medication. More severe cases of deviated septum may require surgery to repair the septum."
What are the symptoms of deviated septum?,"'A deviated septum may not cause any problems in some people. When a deviated septum does cause symptoms, they may include:'   Difficulty breathing through the nose Nasal congestion, usually one side more than the other Recurrent sinus infections Nosebleeds Sleep problems, such as contributing to loud snoring or sleep apnea Headache postnasal drip"
What are the causes of deviated septum?,"'Most people do not have a perfectly straight septum, but it may be misaligned due to a two main causes: '   A person can be born with a deviated 
septum (congenital), or it can bend due to normal growth during childhood.  Another cause of deviated septum is 
injury or trauma, such as a broken nose. "
When should I see a doctor about a deviated septum?,"'See your doctor about a deviated septum if you have:''A deviated septum may cause any of these problems, however, there are other reasons these symptoms may occur and it is important to see a doctor for a correct diagnosis and treatment.' trouble with nasal breathing, sleep problems (particularly sleep apnea), or chronic sinus problems."
How is deviated septum diagnosed?,"'Your health care professional can diagnose a deviated septum during the physical examination. Usually a bright light and an instrument that can help visualize the nasal septum by opening the nostril (nasal speculum) will help make the correct diagnosis. Some deviated septums are deep in the nose and may require further evaluation in the office with a small telescope or endoscope. Imaging may occasionally be done with a ''CT scan'' to view the extent and other associated to findings, but this is not often done.' "
How is deviated septum treated?,"'A deviated septum is an extremely common condition and many people with a deviated septum do not need treatment.''Some symptoms such as a stuffy nose or postnasal drip may be alleviated with medication, including decongestants, ''antihistamines'', or nasal sprays. In many cases, medications are tried before surgery is recommended.''If a person has a deviated septum and it causes breathing problems or ''sleep'' apnea and ''snoring'', surgery may be recommended to repair the septum. Surgery to fix a deviated septum is called'  a septoplasty, submucous resection of the septum, or septal reconstruction."
Can deviated septum be prevented?,"'A deviated septum that is caused by injury to the nose or face may be prevented by following safety precautions:' Always wear proper helmets and headgear 
when playing sports Always wear your seatbelt when riding 
in a car"
What is neuromyelitis optica?,'Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an uncommon disease syndrome of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. '  
What are the symptoms of neuromyelitis optica?,"'Individuals with NMO develop ''optic neuritis'', which causes ''pain'' in the eye and ''vision loss'', and transverse myelitis, which causes ''weakness'', numbness, and sometimes ''paralysis'"" of the arms and legs, along with sensory disturbances and loss of bladder and bowel control. NMO leads to loss of myelin, which is a fatty substance that surrounds nerve fibers and helps nerve signals move from cell to cell. The syndrome can also damage nerve fibers and leave areas of broken-down tissue. In the disease process of NMO, for reasons that aren't yet clear, immune system cells and antibodies attack and destroy myelin cells in the optic nerves and the spinal cord. ""  "
How is neuromyelitis optica diagnosed?,"'Historically, NMO was diagnosed in patients who experienced a rapid onset of ''blindness'' in one or both eyes, followed within days or weeks by varying degrees of paralysis in the arms and legs. In most cases, however, the interval between ''optic neuritis'' and transverse myelitis is significantly longer, sometimes as long as several years. After the initial attack, NMO follows an unpredictable course. Most individuals with the syndrome experience clusters of attacks months or years apart, followed by partial recovery during periods of remission. This relapsing form of NMO primarily affects women. The female to male ratio is greater than 4:1. Another form of NMO, in which an individual only has a single, severe attack extending over a month or two, is most likely a distinct disease that affects men and women with equal frequency. The onset of NMO varies from childhood to adulthood, with two peaks, one in childhood and the other in adults in their 40s.''In the past, NMO was considered to be a severe variant of ''multiple sclerosis'' (''MS'') because both can cause attacks of optic neuritis and myelitis. Recent discoveries, however, suggest it is a separate disease. NMO is different from ''MS'' in the severity of its attacks and its tendency to solely strike the optic nerves and spinal cord at the beginning of the disease. Symptoms outside of the optic nerves and spinal cord are rare, although certain symptoms, including uncontrollable ''vomiting'' and ''hiccups'', are now recognized as relatively specific symptoms of NMO that are due to brainstem involvement.''The recent discovery of an antibody in the blood of individuals with NMO gives doctors a reliable biomarker to distinguish NMO from ''MS''. The antibody, known as NMO-IgG, seems to be present in about 70 percent of those with NMO and is not found in people with MS or other similar conditions.'  "
What is the treatment for neuromyelitis optica?,"'There is no cure for NMO, but there are therapies to treat an attack while it is happening, to reduce symptoms, and to prevent relapses. Doctors usually treat an initial attack of NMO with a combination of a ''corticosteroid'' drug (''methylprednisolone'') to stop the attack, and an immunosuppressive drug (''azathioprine'') for ''prevention'' of subsequent attacks. If frequent relapses occur, some individuals may need to continue a low dose of steroids for longer periods. Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) is a technique that separates antibodies out of the blood stream and is used with people who are unresponsive to corticosteroid therapy. ''Pain'', ''stiffness'', ''muscle spasms'', and bladder and bowel control problems can be managed with the appropriate medications and therapies. Individuals with major disability will require the combined efforts of occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and social services professionals to address their complex rehabilitation needs.'  "
What is the prognosis for neuromyelitis optica?,"'Most individuals with NMO have an unpredictable, relapsing course of disease with attacks occurring months or years apart. Disability is cumulative, the result of each attack damaging new areas of myelin. Some individuals are severely affected by NMO and can lose vision in both eyes and the use of their arms and legs. Most individuals experience a moderate degree of permanent limb weakness from myelitis. Muscle weakness can cause ''breathing'' difficulties and may require the use of artificial ventilation. The death of an individual with NMO is most often caused by respiratory complications from myelitis attacks. '  "
What research is being done?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) conducts research related to NMO in laboratories at the NIH and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure rare neurological syndromes such as NMO. ' "
What is osteoporosis?,"'Osteoporosis is a medical condition that is characterized by bones that are less dense than, and thus not as strong as, normal bone. Osteoporosis increases the risk of breaking a bone (fracture) with even minor ''trauma'', such as a fall from standing height, or even from a ''cough'' or sneeze. Unfortunately, people often do not realize they have osteoporosis until either they have a fracture or have a screening test ordered by their doctor to check for osteoporosis. Osteoporosis and low bone mass affect an estimated 44 million Americans. Of those, 10 million have osteoporosis, and the remaining 34 million have a lower than normal bone mass (medically termed ''osteopenia'') and are at higher risk of developing osteoporosis. Women are four times more likely to develop osteoporosis than men. Other health risk factors include older age, family history of osteoporosis, small and thin stature, inactive lifestyle, ''smoking'', ''alcohol'', and use of certain medications, including steroids.' "
How does osteoporosis occur?,"'In order to understand the role of bone mineral density scanning, it is important to know about how osteoporosis occurs. Bone is a living tissue and is constantly being remodeled. This is the natural, healthy state of continuous uptake of old bone (resorption) followed by the deposit of new bone. This turnover is important in keeping bones healthy and in repairing any minor damage that may occur with wear and tear. The cells that lay new bone down are called osteoblasts, and the cells responsible for resorption of old bone are called osteoclasts. Osteoporosis occurs as a result of a mismatch between osteoclast and osteoblast activity. This mismatch can be caused by many different disease states or hormonal changes. It is also commonly a result of ''aging'', change in normal hormones as occurs after ''menopause'', and with diets low in calcium and ''vitamin D''. In osteoporosis, osteoclasts outperform osteoblasts so that more bone is taken up than is laid down. The result is a thinning of the bone with an accompanying loss in bone strength and a greater risk of fracture. A thinning bone results in a lower bone density or bone mass.''There are two major types of bone. Cancellous bone (also known as trabecular bone) is the inner, softer portion of the bone, and cortical bone is the outer, harder layer of bone. Cancellous bone undergoes turnover at a faster rate than cortical bone. As a result, if osteoclast and osteoblast activity become mismatched, cancellous bone is affected more rapidly than cortical bone. Certain areas in the body have a higher ratio of cancellous bone to cortical bone such as the spine (vertebrae), the wrist (distal radius), and the hips (femoral neck).'""Most of a person's bone mass is achieved by early adulthood. After that time, the bone mass gradually declines throughout the rest of a person's life. There is a normal rate of decline in bone mass with age in both men and women. For women, in addition to age, the ""'menopause transition'' itself causes an extra degree of bone loss. This bone loss is greatest in the first three to six years after ''menopause''. Women can lose up to 20% of the total bone mass during this time. Since women generally have a lower bone mass to begin with in comparison with men, the ultimate result is a higher risk of fracture in postmenopausal women as compared to men of the same age. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that men may also be at risk for osteoporosis, especially if they have certain illnesses, a ''low testosterone'' level, are ''smokers'', take certain medications, or are sedentary. The best method to prevent osteoporosis is to achieve as high a bone mass by early adulthood with a proper ''diet'' and regular ''exercise'"". Unfortunately, osteoporosis is not often considered during this time in a person's life."" "
What is bone mineral density (BMD)?,"'The absolute amount of bone as measured by bone mineral density (BMD) testing generally correlates with bone strength and its ability to bear weight. The BMD is measured with a dual energy low-dose X-ray absorptiometry test (referred to as a DXA scan). By measuring BMD, it is possible to predict fracture risk in the same manner that measuring blood pressure can help predict the risk of ''stroke''.''It is important to remember that BMD testing cannot predict the certainty of developing a fracture. It can only predict risk. It is also important to note that a bone density scan, or test, should not be confused with a ''bone scan'', which is a nuclear medicine test in which a radioactive tracer is injected that is used to detect tumors, ''cancer'', ''fractures'', and infections in the bone.'""The World Health Organization has developed definitions for low bone mass (osteopenia) and osteoporosis. These definitions are based on a T-score. The T-score is a measure of how dense a patient's bone is compared to a normal, healthy 30-year-old adult.""'Normal'': A bone BMD is considered normal if the T-score is within 1 standard deviation of the normal young adult value. Thus a T-score between 0 and -1 is considered a normal result. A T-score below -1 is considered an abnormal result.''Low bone mass (medically termed osteopenia)'': A BMD defines osteopenia as a T-score between -1 and -2.5. This signifies an increased fracture risk but does not meet the criteria for osteoporosis.''Osteoporosis'': A BMD more than 2.5 standard deviations from the normal (T score less than or equal to -2.5) defines osteoporosis.''Based on the above medical criteria, it is estimated that 40% of all postmenopausal Caucasian women have osteopenia and that an additional 7% have osteoporosis.' "
Who invented the bone density scan?,"'The bone density scan was invented by the late John R. Cameron (1922-2005), professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. He earned a PhD in physics. He invented bone densitometry in the late 1960s. Bone densitometry, which uses precise, very small ''radiation'' measurements to determine the mineral content of bone, was one of his many important contributions to medical physics.' "
Who performs bone density scans?,"'Bone density scans, or DXA scans, are performed by a trained technician using a DXA machine. The results are then interpreted by a physician. Many different specialist interpret bone density scans, including radiologists, endocrinologists, ''rheumatologists'', gynecologists, and internists.' "
Where is a bone density test done?,"""Bone density tests can be done in a physician's office or in a radiology center in or out of the hospital where other tests such as mammograms, ""'CT scans'', and ''X-rays'' are performed.' "
What information is on a DXA report?,"'There is some variation in DXA reports depending on the facility performing the test. All reports should include the following:' The date of the test, location, and medical equipment used for the test (manufacturer and model of the densitometer) The reason the test was performed The overall diagnosis (normal bone density, osteopenia, or osteoporosis) based on the results of the scan It should mention the results of the test at each site tested. The hip and lumbar spine are always tested. Many medical facilities also measure bone density at the forearm. The bone density is usually reported with three different numbers. First, the actual bone density is reported. This is measured in grams per centimeter squared (g/cm2). Because the exact bone density varies based on the manufacturer and model of the densitometer, the bone density is also reported as a T-score and a Z-score. The T-score is a measure of how dense a patient's bone is compared to a normal, healthy 30-year-old adult. The Z-score is a measure of how dense a patient's bone is compared to the average person of the same age and gender. Comparison of the bone density to any prior tests performed at the same medical facility Many reports include a calculation estimate of the patient's risk of bone fracture based on the results of the bone density scan. This is reported as the risk over the following 10 years of breaking a bone. Some reports also include a vertebral fracture assessment, which uses the DXA to see if there are any bones in the spine that have already fractured. A notation suggesting how long before a follow-up test is needed"
Why is bone mineral density measurement important?,"""Determining a person's BMD helps a health care professional decide if a person is at increased risk for osteoporosis-related fracture. The purpose of BMD testing is to help predict the risk of future fracture so that the treatment program can be optimized. The information from a BMD is used to aid a decision as to whether nonprescription and/or prescription medicine therapy is needed to help reduce the risk of fracture. Additionally, if a patient has a fracture or is planning orthopedic surgery, a diagnosis of osteoporosis might affect the surgical plan. A fracture that could potentially heal in a cast with normal bone mass might require either a longer period of casting or even surgery if the patient has osteoporosis. Sometimes spinal surgeons treat patients with low bone density with bone building medication prior to surgery in order to improve the surgical outcome of bone that is operated on."" "
What is the relationship between BMD and fracture risk?,"'In patients with low bone mass at the hip or the spine (the two areas traditionally measured with DXA [formerly referred to as DEXA] scanning), there is a two- to threefold increase in the incidence of any osteoporotic fracture. In other words, low bone density at the measured areas of the spine and hip can even predict future osteoporotic fractures at other parts of the body besides the spine and hip. In subjects with a BMD in the osteoporosis range, there is approximately a five times increase in the occurrence of osteoporotic fractures.' "
Who should have BMD testing?,"'BMD testing is recommended for all women over the age of 65. Additionally, postmenopausal women under 65 years who have risk factors for osteoporosis other than ''menopause'' (these include a previous history of fractures, low body weight, ''cigarette smoking'', and a family history of fractures) should be tested. Finally, men or women with strong risk factors as listed below should discuss the benefit of DXA scanning with their health care professional to see if testing is indicated.''The following are potential risk factors for osteoporosis that might suggest the need for DXA scanning:' Personal history of fracture as an adult History of fracture in first-degree relative Low body weight or thin body stature Advanced age Current cigarette smoking Use of corticosteroid therapy for more than three months Impaired vision Estrogen deficiency at early age Dementia Poor health/frailty Recent falls Lifelong low calcium intake Low physical activity Alcohol intake of more than two drinks/day Thyroid disease Rheumatoid arthritis Excessive caffeine consumption Use of oral contraceptive (birth control pills)"
How is BMD measured?,"""Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, or DXA, is the most common method to measure a patient's BMD. DXA, or densitometry, is relatively easy to perform and the amount of radiation exposure is low. A DXA scanner is a machine that produces two X-ray beams, each with different energy levels. One beam is high energy while the other is low energy. The amount of X-rays that pass through the bone is measured for each beam. This will vary depending on the thickness of the bone. Based on the difference between the two X-ray beams, the bone density can be measured. The radiation exposure from a DXA scan is actually much less than that from a traditional ""'chest X-ray''.''At present, DXA scanning gives information on the BMD two main areas, the hip and spine. Another bone that is often evaluated is the bone of the forearm. Although osteoporosis involves the whole body, measurements of BMD at one site can be predictive of fractures at other sites. Scanning generally takes 10 to 20 minutes to complete and is painless. The patient needs to be able to lie still on the table during the testing. There is no IV or other injection needed for this test. In preparation for a DXA, on the day of the test, you may eat a normal meal, but you should not take any ''calcium supplements'' for 24 hours prior to the test.''Certain conditions can alter the results of the DXA scan, making result less reliable. These include a lumbar spinal deformity (''scoliosis''), extensive ''degenerative arthritis'', a large amount of calcium in the blood vessels (''atherosclerosis''), or multiple fractures. These conditions can falsely elevate the measured BMD with the DXA scan.' "
What are other methods of measuring BMD?,"'There are small DXA scanners called peripheral DXA machines. These machines often measure BMD at the heel (calcaneus), shin bone (distal tibia), or kneecap (''patella''). Regular DXA machines have a standard reference (called NHANES III) that can be used for all machines, no matter the manufacturer. However, peripheral DXA machines do not yet have a uniform reference standard for the normal peak young adult bone mass that can apply to all machines and all manufacturers. This is necessary for peripheral DXA to be ready for more widespread use. Efforts are in progress to make the peripheral DXA technique more standardized. At present, it is best used as a screening test to consider whether or not a patient would benefit from further bone density testing.''Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) can be used to assess BMD. A standard CT scanner is used in this method. However, the amount of radiation exposure is higher than with DXA and the cost is greater. For these reasons, QCT is not in general clinical use.''Ultrasound'"" is a relatively new diagnostic tool to measure BMD. There is no radiation source with this procedure. An ultrasound beam is directed at the area being analyzed. The scattering and absorption of the waves allow for an assessment of bone density. The results are not as precise as with the other methods mentioned. This technique is relatively new, and there is considerable research being conducted in this area. Since ultrasounds can easily be performed in a physician's office, this method may become valuable for screening larger populations if its accuracy becomes more refined. If the BMD is low on the ultrasound test, you might be asked to have a DXA scan to confirm the results.""'New techniques that are being developed to measure both the BMD and even the quality of the bone are micro CT and MR, which use technologies related to CT and ''MRI'' scans. These are not yet available for clinical use.' "
How often should DXA scans be repeated to monitor treatment?,"'The frequency of monitoring osteoporosis treatment using DXA scans is highly controversial. Some health care professionals recommend DXA scanning at one- to two-year intervals to monitor changes in bone density during treatment. But recent scientific evidence questions the usefulness of such interval monitoring. Reasons why repeating bone density scans is extremely tricky include:' Bone density changes so slowly that the changes may be smaller than the measurement error of the machine. In other words, repeat DXA scans cannot distinguish between a ""real"" increase in bone density or a mere variation in measurement from the machine itself. Typically, BMD changes 1% per year, which is less than the error of a DXA machine (usually in the range of 3%). Changes of less than 2%-4% in the vertebrae and 3%-6% at the hip from test to test can be due to the precision error of the method. Whereas the real purpose of prescription osteoporosis treatment is to decrease future bone fractures, there is no good correlation between increases in bone density as measured by DXA with decreases in fracture risks with treatment. There are multiple examples of this in recent clinical studies. For example, the improvement in BMD only accounted for 4% of the reduction in spine fracture risk with raloxifene (Evista), 16% of the reduction in spine fracture risk with alendronate (Fosamax), and 18% of the reduction in spine fracture risk with risedronate (Actonel, Atelvia). Thus, improvement in BMD does not indicate the amount of the antifracture benefit of osteoporosis medication. Prescription medication may decrease a person's risk of fracture even when there is no apparent increase in BMD. Physicians and nonphysicians alike are often surprised to learn this information! Even if the DXA scan shows continued deterioration in bone density during treatment, no research data exists demonstrating that changing a medication, combining medications, or increasing medication doses will be safe and helpful in decreasing the future risk of fractures compared to just continuing the same medication. Even if a person's bone density deteriorates during treatment, it is quite likely that the person would have lost even more bone density without treatment. Recent research has shown that women who lose bone density after the first year of menopausal hormone therapy will gain bone density in the next two years, whereas women who gain in the first year will tend to lose density in the next two years of therapy. Therefore, bone density during treatment naturally fluctuates and may not be indicative of the fracture protection of the medication."
What is the cost of DXA?,"'The cost for DXA scanning varies depending on insurance policies and coverage. In general, a patient without health care coverage paying cash can expect to pay approximately $200-$300 U.S. for the procedure.' "
What about the accuracy of BMD testing in the doctor's office using smaller equipment?,"""There are several devices that are smaller than the standard DXA scanners that are being used in health care professional's offices to screen for low bone density. Very little scientific data is available about these smaller units. Most of the information comes directly from the equipment manufacturers themselves. Many of these models test peripheral bones in the ""'feet'' or hands. Other units use ''ultrasonography''. These techniques can be less accurate than BMD testing performed with state of the art equipment. Additionally, office-testing equipment can range dramatically in price and quality.''In general, these devices may be reasonable to measure overall fracture risk but are not useful in monitoring therapy. Their use might be limited to screening and results would require confirmation using DXA. In addition, expertise in using the equipment and interpreting the data can vary. At present, it is difficult to comment on these other methods of BMD testing. Interpretation of the results of these tests may be more difficult and not as reliable as the standard DXA scan. Some doctors use these as screening tools and recommend more formal DXA testing if they are abnormal.' "
Summary,"'Osteoporosis is a disease that results in a significant risk of fracture. The consequences of fracture can include hospitalization, immobility, a decrease in the quality of life, and even death.''From a larger perspective, it is a costly disease in terms of the health-care system and time lost from work. Early detection and therapy is the mainstay for trying to prevent these complications. BMD testing results correlate well with the risk of fracture, and the testing is easily performed in a time-efficient manner without any discomfort. Although many methods of BMD testing exist, the best currently is DXA scanning. It is imperative that testing ultimately be done using state-of-the-art equipment with capable highly trained personnel and a doctor well ''versed'' in interpreting the results.' "
What is diabetes insipidus?,"'Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a disorder of water balance. The body normally balances fluid intake with the excretion of fluid in urine. However, people with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus produce too much urine (polyuria), which causes them to be excessively thirsty (polydipsia). Affected individuals can quickly become dehydrated if they do not drink enough water, especially in hot weather or when they are sick.''Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be either acquired or hereditary. The acquired form is brought on by certain ''drugs'' and chronic diseases and can occur at any time during life. The hereditary form is caused by genetic mutations, and its signs and symptoms usually become apparent within the first few months of life.'  "
What are the symptoms of diabetes insipidus in infants?,"'Infants with hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus may eat poorly and fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). They may also be irritable and experience ''fevers'', ''diarrhea'', and ''vomiting''. Recurrent episodes of ''dehydration'' can lead to slow growth and delayed development. If the condition is not well-managed, over time it can damage the bladder and kidneys leading to ''pain'', infections, and ''kidney failure''. With appropriate treatment, affected individuals usually have few complications and a normal lifespan.' "
Are diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus the same condition?,"'Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus should not be confused with diabetes mellitus, which is much more common. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by ''high blood sugar'' levels resulting from a shortage of the hormone ''insulin'' or an insensitivity to this hormone. Although nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus have some features in common, they are separate disorders with different causes.'  "
Is diabetes insipidus inherited?,"'When nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results from mutations in the AVPR2 gene, the condition has an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. The AVPR2 gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation usually has to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. However, some females who carry a single mutated copy of the AVPR2 gene have features of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, including polyuria and polydipsia. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.''When nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by mutations in the AQP2 gene, it can have either an autosomal recessive or, less commonly, an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. In autosomal recessive inheritance, both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. In autosomal dominant inheritance, one mutated copy of the AQP2 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.'  "
What tests and procedures diagnose diabetes insipidus?,"'A healthcare professional can diagnose a person with diabetes insipidus based on;'""Taking a medical and family history can help a health care provider diagnose diabetes insipidus. A health care provider will ask the patient to review his or her symptoms and ask whether the patient's family has a history of diabetes insipidus or its symptoms.""""A physical exam can help diagnose diabetes insipidus. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually examines the patient's skin and appearance, checking for signs of ""'dehydration''.'""Urinalysis tests a urine sample. A patient collects the urine sample in a special container at home, in a health care provider's office, or at a commercial facility. A health care provider tests the sample in the same location or sends it to a lab for analysis. The test can show whether the urine is dilute or concentrated. The test can also show the presence of glucose, which can distinguish between diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus. The health care provider may also have the patient collect urine in a special container over a 24-hour period to measure the total amount of urine produced by the kidneys.""""A blood test involves drawing a patient's blood at a health care provider’s office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test measures sodium levels, which can help diagnose diabetes insipidus and in some cases determine the type.""'A fluid deprivation test measures changes in a patient’s body weight and urine concentration after restricting liquid intake. A health care provider can perform two types of fluid deprivation tests:''A short form of the deprivation test.'' A health care provider instructs the patient to stop drinking all liquids for a specific period of time, usually during dinner. The next morning, the patient will collect a urine sample at home. The patient then returns the urine sample to his or her health care provider or takes it to a lab where a technician measures the concentration of the urine sample.''A formal fluid deprivation test.'"" A health care provider performs this test in a hospital to continuously monitor the patient for signs of dehydration. Patients do not need anesthesia. A health care provider weighs the patient and analyzes a urine sample. The health care provider repeats the tests and measures the patient's ""'blood pressure'' every 1 to 2 hours until one of the following happens:'""At the end of the test, a healthcare provider will compare the patient's blood sodium, vasopressin levels, and urine concentration to determine whether the patient has diabetes insipidus. Sometimes, the health care provider may administer medications during the test to see if they increase a patient's urine concentration. In other cases, the health care provider may give the patient a concentrated sodium solution intravenously at the end of the test to increase the patient's blood sodium level and determine if he or she has diabetes insipidus.""""Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a test that takes pictures of the body's internal organs and soft tissues without using ""'x-rays''. A specially trained technician performs the procedure in an outpatient center or a hospital, and a radiologist, a doctor who specializes in medical imaging who interprets the images. A patient does not need anesthesia, although people with a fear of confined spaces may receive light sedation. An MRI may include an injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. With most MRI machines, the person lies on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device that may be open ended or closed at one end. Some MRI machines allow the patient to lie in a more open space. ''MRIs'' cannot diagnose diabetes insipidus. Instead, an MRI can show if the patient has problems with his or her hypothalamus or ''pituitary gland'"" or help the health care provider determine if diabetes insipidus is the possible cause of the patient's symptoms."" medical and family history physical exam urinalysis blood tests fluid deprivation test magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) The patient's blood pressure drops too low or the patient has a rapid heartbeat when standing.

What is the treatment for diabetes insipidus?,"'The primary treatment for diabetes insipidus involves drinking enough liquid to prevent dehydration. A health care provider may refer a person with diabetes insipidus to a nephrologist - a doctor who specializes in treating kidney problems or to an endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in treating disorders of the hormone-producing glands. Treatment for frequent urination or constant ''thirst'"" depends on the patient's type of diabetes insipidus:""'Researchers have not found that eating, ''diet'', and ''nutrition'' play a role in causing or preventing diabetes insipidus.' Central diabetes insipidus. A synthetic, or man-made, hormone called desmopressin treats central diabetes insipidus. The medication comes as an injection, a nasal spray, or a pill. The medication works by replacing the vasopressin that a patient’s body normally produces. This treatment helps a patient manage symptoms of central diabetes insipidus; however, it does not cure the disease. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In some cases, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus goes away after treatment of the cause. For example, switching medications or taking steps to balance the amount of calcium or potassium in the patient’s body may resolve the problem. Medications for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus include diuretics, either alone or combined with aspirin or ibuprofen. Diuretics. Doctors commonly prescribe diuretics to help patients’ kidneys remove fluid from the body. Paradoxically, in people with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a class of diuretics called thiazides reduces urine production and helps patients’ kidneys concentrate urine. Aspirin or ibuprofen also helps reduce urine volume. Dipsogenic diabetes insipidus. Researchers have not yet found an effective treatment for dipsogenic diabetes insipidus. People can try sucking on ice chips or sour candies to moisten their mouths and increase saliva flow, which may reduce the desire to drink. For a person who wakes multiple times at night to urinate because of dipsogenic diabetes insipidus, taking a small dose of desmopressin at bedtime may help. Initially, the health care provider will monitor the patient’s blood sodium levels to prevent hyponatremia, or low sodium levels in the blood. Gestational diabetes insipidus. A doctor can prescribe desmopressin for women with gestational diabetes insipidus. An expecting mother’s placenta does not destroy desmopressin as it does vasopressin. Most women will not need treatment after delivery. Complications. Most people with diabetes insipidus can prevent serious problems and live a normal life if they follow the team of healthcare professionals recommendations and keep their symptoms under control."

What should I know about diabetes type 1 and type 2?,"'Diabetes'' Type 1 and Type 2 facts''How does diabetes make you feel?'   Diabetes is a chronic condition associated with abnormally high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Insulin produced by the pancreas lowers blood glucose. Absence or insufficient production of insulin, or an inability of the body to properly use insulin causes diabetes. The two types of diabetes are referred to as type 1 and type 2. Former names for these conditions were insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes, or juvenile onset and adult-onset diabetes. Some of the risk factors for getting diabetes include being overweight or obese, leading a sedentary lifestyle, a family history of diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), and low levels of the ""good"" cholesterol (HDL) and elevated levels of triglycerides in the blood. If you think you may have prediabetes or diabetes contact a health-care professional. Symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes includeincreased urine output,excessive thirst,weight loss,hunger,fatigue,skin problemsslow healing wounds,yeast infections, andtingling or numbness in the feet or toes. increased urine output, excessive thirst, weight loss, hunger, fatigue, skin problems slow healing wounds, yeast infections, and tingling or numbness in the feet or toes."
What is diabetes?,"'Diabetes mellitus'' is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by ''high blood sugar'' (glucose) levels that result from defects in insulin secretion, or its action, or both. Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes (as it will be in this article) was first identified as a disease associated with ""sweet urine,"" and excessive muscle loss in the ancient world. Elevated levels of blood glucose (''hyperglycemia'') lead to spillage of glucose into the urine, hence the term sweet urine.''Normally, blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin lowers the blood glucose level. When the blood glucose elevates (for example, after eating food), insulin is released from the pancreas to normalize the glucose level by promoting the uptake of glucose into body cells. In patients with diabetes, the absence of insufficient production of or lack of response to insulin causes hyperglycemia. Diabetes is a chronic medical condition, meaning that although it can be controlled, it lasts a lifetime.' "
How many people in the US have diabetes?," Diabetes affects approximately 30.3 million people (9.4% of the population) in the United States, while another estimated 84.1 million people have prediabetes and don't know it. An estimated 7.2 million people in the United States have diabetes and don't even know it. Over time, diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney failure, and nerve damage. These types of damage are the result of damage to small vessels, referred to as microvascular disease. Diabetes also is an important factor in accelerating the hardening and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis), leading to strokes, coronary heart disease, and other large blood vessel diseases. This is referred to as macrovascular disease. From an economic perspective, the total annual cost of diabetes in 2012 was estimated to be 245 billion dollars in the United States. This included 116 billion in direct medical costs (healthcare costs) for people with diabetes and another 69 billion in other costs due to disability, premature death, or work loss. Medical expenses for people with diabetes are over two times higher than those for people who do not have diabetes. Remember, these numbers reflect only the population in the United States. Globally, the statistics are staggering. Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of death in the United States listed on death certificates in recent years."
9 early signs and symptoms of diabetes,"   The early symptoms of untreated diabetes are related to elevated blood sugar levels, and loss of glucose in the urine. High amounts of glucose in the urine can cause increased urine output (frequent urination) and lead to dehydration. The dehydration also causes increased thirst and water consumption. A relative or absolute insulin deficiency eventually leads to weight loss. The weight loss of diabetes occurs despite an increase in appetite. Some untreated diabetes patients also complain of fatigue. Nausea and vomiting can also occur in patients with untreated diabetes. Frequent infections (such as infections of the bladder, skin, and vaginal areas) are more likely to occur in people with untreated or poorly-controlled diabetes. Fluctuations in blood glucose levels can lead to blurred vision. Extremely elevated glucose levels can lead to lethargy and coma."
How do I know if I have diabetes?," Many people are unaware that they have diabetes, especially in its early stages when symptoms may not be present. There is no definite way to know if you have diabetes without undergoing blood tests to determine your blood glucose levels (see section on Diagnosis of diabetes). See your doctor if you have symptoms of diabetes or if you are concerned about your diabetes risk."
What causes diabetes?,"""Insufficient production of insulin (either absolutely or relative to the body's needs), production of defective insulin (which is uncommon), or the inability of cells to use insulin properly and efficiently leads to hyperglycemia and diabetes.""'In ''type 2 diabetes'', there also is a steady decline of beta cells that adds to the process of elevated blood sugars. Essentially, if someone is resistant to insulin, the body can, to some degree, increase production of insulin and overcome the level of resistance. After time, if production decreases and insulin cannot be released as vigorously, hyperglycemia develops.''What is glucose?''Glucose is a simple sugar found in food. Glucose is an essential nutrient that provides energy for the proper functioning of the body cells. Carbohydrates are broken down in the small intestine and the glucose in digested food is then absorbed by the intestinal cells into the bloodstream, and is carried by the bloodstream to all the cells in the body where it is utilized. However, glucose cannot enter the cells alone and needs insulin to aid in its transport into the cells. Without insulin, the cells become starved of glucose energy despite the presence of abundant glucose in the bloodstream. In certain types of diabetes, the cells\' inability to utilize glucose gives rise to the ironic situation of ""starvation in the midst of plenty"". The abundant, unutilized glucose is wastefully excreted in the urine.''What is insulin?'""Insulin is a hormone that is produced by specialized cells (beta cells) of the pancreas. (The pancreas is a deep-seated organ in the abdomen located behind the stomach.) In addition to helping glucose enter the cells, insulin is also important in tightly regulating the level of glucose in the blood. After a meal, the blood glucose level rises. In response to the increased glucose level, the pancreas normally releases more insulin into the bloodstream to help glucose enter the cells and lower blood glucose levels after a meal. When the blood glucose levels are lowered, the insulin release from the pancreas is turned down. It is important to note that even in the fasting state there is a low steady release of insulin than fluctuates a bit and helps to maintain a steady blood sugar level during fasting. In normal individuals, such a regulatory system helps to keep blood glucose levels in a tightly controlled range. As outlined above, in patients with diabetes, the insulin is either absent, relatively insufficient for the body's needs, or not used properly by the body. All of these factors cause elevated levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia).""   This latter condition affects mostly the cells of muscle and fat tissues, and results in a condition known as insulin resistance. This is the primary problem in type 2 diabetes. The absolute lack of insulin, usually secondary to a destructive process affecting the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, is the main disorder in type 1 diabetes."
What are the risk factors for diabetes?,"'Risk factors for ''type 1 diabetes'' are not as well understood as those for type 2 diabetes. Family history is a known risk factor for ''type 1 diabetes''. Other risk factors can include having certain infections or diseases of the pancreas.''Risk factors for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes are many. The following can raise your risk of developing type 2 diabetes:' Being obese or overweight High blood pressure Elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of ""good"" cholesterol (HDL) Sedentary lifestyle Family history Increasing age Polycystic ovary syndrome Impaired glucose tolerance  Insulin resistance Gestational diabetes during a pregnancy Ethnic background: Hispanic/Latino Americans, African-Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Alaska natives are at greater risk."
What are the different types of diabetes?,"""There are two major types of diabetes, called type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes was also formerly called insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), or juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas undergoes an autoimmune attack by the body itself, and is rendered incapable of making insulin. Abnormal antibodies have been found in the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes. Antibodies are proteins in the blood that are part of the body's immune system. The patient with type 1 diabetes must rely on insulin medication for survival."" "
What is type 1 diabetes?,"""In autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly manufactures antibodies and inflammatory cells that are directed against and cause damage to patients' own body tissues. In persons with type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas, which are responsible for insulin production, are attacked by the misdirected immune system. It is believed that the tendency to develop abnormal antibodies in type 1 diabetes is, in part, genetically ""'inherited'', though the details are not fully understood.''Exposure to certain viral infections (''mumps'' and Coxsackie ''viruses'') or other environmental toxins may serve to trigger abnormal antibody responses that cause damage to the pancreas cells where insulin is made. Some of the antibodies seen in type 1 diabetes include anti-islet cell antibodies, anti-insulin antibodies and anti-glutamic decarboxylase antibodies. These antibodies can be detected in the majority of patients, and may help determine which individuals are at risk for developing type 1 diabetes.''At present, the American Diabetes Association does not recommend general screening of the population for type 1 diabetes, though screening of high risk individuals, such as those with a first degree relative (sibling or parent) with type 1 diabetes should be encouraged. Type 1 diabetes tends to occur in young, lean individuals, usually before 30 years of age; however, older patients do present with this form of diabetes on occasion. This subgroup is referred to as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). LADA is a slow, progressive form of type 1 diabetes. Of all the people with diabetes, only approximately 10% have type 1 diabetes and the remaining 90% have type 2 diabetes.' "
What is type 2 diabetes?,"""Type 2 diabetes was also previously referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), or adult-onset diabetes mellitus (AODM). In type 2 diabetes, patients can still produce insulin, but do so relatively inadequately for their body's needs, particularly in the face of insulin resistance as discussed above. In many cases this actually means the pancreas produces larger than normal quantities of insulin. A major feature of type 2 diabetes is a lack of sensitivity to insulin by the cells of the body (particularly fat and muscle cells).""'In addition to the problems with an increase in insulin resistance, the release of insulin by the pancreas may also be defective and suboptimal. In fact, there is a known steady decline in beta cell production of insulin in type 2 diabetes that contributes to worsening glucose control. (This is a major factor for many patients with type 2 diabetes who ultimately require insulin therapy.) Finally, the ''liver'' in these patients continues to produce glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis despite elevated glucose levels. The control of gluconeogenesis becomes compromised.''While it is said that type 2 diabetes occurs mostly in individuals over 30 years old and the incidence increases with age, an alarming number of patients with type 2 diabetes are barely in their teen years. Most of these cases are a direct result of poor eating habits, higher body weight, and lack of ''exercise''.''While there is a strong genetic component to developing this form of diabetes, there are other risk factors - the most significant of which is ''obesity''. There is a direct relationship between the degree of obesity and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and this holds true in children as well as adults. It is estimated that the chance to develop diabetes doubles for every 20% increase over desirable body weight.''Regarding age, data shows that for each decade after 40 years of age regardless of weight there is an increase in incidence of diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes in persons 65 years of age and older is around 25%. Type 2 diabetes is also more common in certain ethnic groups. Compared with a 7% prevalence in non-Hispanic Caucasians, the prevalence in Asian Americans is estimated to be 8.0%, in Hispanics 13%, in blacks around 12.3%, and in certain Native American communities 20% to 50%. Finally, diabetes occurs much more frequently in women with a prior history of diabetes that develops during pregnancy (''gestational diabetes'').' "
What are the other types of diabetes?,"'Diabetes can occur temporarily during pregnancy, and reports suggest that it occurs in 2% to 10% of all ''pregnancies''. Significant hormonal changes during pregnancy can lead to blood sugar elevation in genetically predisposed individuals. Blood sugar elevation during pregnancy is called gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes usually resolves once the baby is born. However, 35% to 60% of women with gestational diabetes will eventually develop type 2 diabetes over the next 10 to 20 years, especially in those who require insulin during pregnancy and those who remain overweight after their delivery. Women with gestational diabetes are usually asked to undergo an ''oral glucose tolerance test'' about six weeks after giving birth to determine if their diabetes has persisted beyond the pregnancy, or if any evidence (such as impaired glucose tolerance) is present that may be a clue to a risk for developing diabetes.''""Secondary"" diabetes refers to elevated blood sugar levels from another medical condition. Secondary diabetes may develop when the pancreatic tissue responsible for the production of insulin is destroyed by disease, such as ''chronic pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas by toxins like excessive ''alcohol''), ''trauma'', or surgical removal of the pancreas.'""Diabetes can also result from other hormonal disturbances, such as excessive growth hormone production (acromegaly) and Cushing's syndrome. In acromegaly, a ""'pituitary gland'' ''tumor'"" at the base of the brain causes excessive production of growth hormone, leading to hyperglycemia. In Cushing's syndrome, the adrenal glands produce an excess of cortisol, which promotes blood sugar elevation.""'Certain medications may worsen diabetes control, or ""unmask"" latent diabetes. This is seen most commonly when steroid medications (such as ''prednisone'') are taken and also with medications used in the treatment of ''HIV'' infection (''AIDS'').' "
What kind of doctor treats diabetes?,"'Endocrinology is the specialty of medicine that deals with hormone disturbances, and both endocrinologists and pediatric endocrinologists manage patients with diabetes. People with diabetes may also be treated by family medicine or internal medicine specialists. When complications arise, people with diabetes may be treated by other specialists, including neurologists, gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists, surgeons, cardiologists, or others.' "
How is diabetes diagnosed?,"'The  ''fasting blood glucose'"" (sugar) test is the preferred way to diagnose diabetes. It is easy to perform and convenient. After the person has fasted overnight (at least 8 hours), a single sample of blood is drawn and sent to the laboratory for analysis. This can also be done accurately in a doctor's office using a glucose meter.""'When fasting blood glucose stays above 100mg/dl, but in the range of 100-126mg/dl, this is known as impaired fasting glucose (IFG). While patients with IFG or prediabetes do not have the diagnosis of diabetes, this condition carries with it its own risks and concerns, and is addressed elsewhere.''Though not routinely used any longer, the oral ''glucose tolerance test'' (OGTT) is a gold standard for making the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It is still commonly used for diagnosing gestational diabetes and in conditions of pre-diabetes, such as polycystic ovary syndrome. With an oral glucose tolerance test, the person fasts overnight (at least eight but not more than 16 hours). Then first, the fasting plasma glucose is tested. After this test, the person receives an oral dose (75 grams) of glucose. There are several methods employed by obstetricians to do this test, but the one described here is standard. Usually, the glucose is in a sweet-tasting liquid that the person ''drinks''. Blood samples are taken at specific intervals to measure the blood glucose.''For the test to give reliable results:''The classic oral glucose tolerance test measures blood glucose levels five times over a period of three hours. Some physicians simply get a baseline blood sample followed by a sample two hours after drinking the glucose solution. In a person without diabetes, the glucose levels rise and then fall quickly. In someone with diabetes, glucose levels rise higher than normal and fail to come back down as fast.''People with glucose levels between normal and diabetic have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or insulin resistance. People with impaired glucose tolerance do not have diabetes, but are at high risk for progressing to diabetes. Each year, 1% to 5% of people whose test results show impaired glucose tolerance actually eventually develop diabetes. Weight loss and ''exercise'' may help people with impaired glucose tolerance return their glucose levels to normal. In addition, some physicians advocate the use of medications, such as ''metformin'' (''Glucophage''), to help prevent/delay the onset of overt diabetes.''Research has shown that impaired glucose tolerance itself may be a risk factor for the development of ''heart disease''. In the medical community, most physicians now understand that impaired glucose tolerance is not simply a precursor of diabetes, but is its own clinical disease entity that requires treatment and monitoring.''Glucose tolerance tests may lead to one of the following diagnoses:' Normal fasting plasma glucose levels are less than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Fasting plasma glucose levels of more than 126 mg/dl on two or more tests on different days indicate diabetes. A random blood glucose test can also be used to diagnose diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dl or higher indicates diabetes. The person must be in good health (not have any other illnesses, not even a cold). The person should be normally active (not lying down, for example, as an inpatient in a hospital), and The person should not be taking medicines that could affect the blood glucose. The morning of the test, the person should not smoke or drink coffee. Normal response: A person is said to have a normal response when the 2-hour glucose level is less than 140 mg/dl, and all values between 0 and 2 hours are less than 200 mg/dl. Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes): A person is said to have impaired glucose tolerance when the fasting plasma glucose is less than 126 mg/dl and the 2-hour glucose level is between 140 and 199 mg/dl. Diabetes: A person has diabetes when two diagnostic tests done on different days show that the blood glucose level is high. Gestational diabetes:  A pregnant woman has gestational diabetes when she has any two of the following:, a fasting plasma glucose of 92 mg/dl or more, a 1-hour glucose level of 180 mg/dl or more, or a 2-hour glucose level of 153 mg/dl, or more."
Why is blood sugar checked at home?,"'Home blood sugar (glucose) testing is an important part of controlling blood sugar. One important goal of ''diabetes treatment'' is to keep the blood glucose levels near the normal range of 70 to 120 mg/dl before meals and under 140 mg/dl at two hours after eating. Blood glucose levels are usually tested before and after meals, and at bedtime. The blood sugar level is typically determined by pricking a fingertip with a lancing device and applying the blood to a glucose meter, which reads the value. There are many meters on the market, for example, Accu-Check Advantage, One Touch Ultra, Sure Step and Freestyle. Each meter has its own advantages and disadvantages (some use less blood, some have a larger digital readout, some take a shorter time to give you results, etc.). The test results are then used to help patients make adjustments in medications, diets, and physical activities.''There are some interesting developments in blood glucose monitoring including continuous glucose sensors. The new continuous glucose sensor systems involve an implantable cannula placed just under the skin in the abdomen or in the arm. This cannula allows for frequent sampling of blood glucose levels. Attached to this is a transmitter that sends the data to a pager-like device. This device has a visual screen that allows the wearer to see, not only the current glucose reading, but also the graphic trends. In some devices, the rate of change of blood sugar is also shown. There are alarms for low and high sugar levels. Certain models will alarm if the rate of change indicates the wearer is at risk for dropping or rising blood glucose too rapidly. One version is specifically designed to interface with their insulin pumps. In most cases the patient still must manually approve any insulin dose (the pump cannot blindly respond to the glucose information it receives, it can only give a calculated suggestion as to whether the wearer should give insulin, and if so, how much). However, in 2013 the US FDA approved the first artificial pancreas type device, meaning an implanted sensor and pump combination that stops insulin delivery when glucose levels reach a certain low point. All of these devices need to be correlated to fingersticks measurements for a few hours before they can function independently. The devices can then provide readings for 3 to 5 days.''Diabetes experts feel that these blood glucose monitoring devices give patients a significant amount of independence to manage their disease process; and they are a great tool for education as well. It is also important to remember that these devices can be used intermittently with fingerstick measurements. For example, a well-controlled patient with diabetes can rely on fingerstick glucose checks a few times a day and do well. If they become ill, if they decide to embark on a new exercise regimen, if they change their ''diet'"" and so on, they can use the sensor to supplement their fingerstick regimen, providing more information on how they are responding to new lifestyle changes or stressors. This kind of system takes us one step closer to closing the loop, and to the development of an artificial pancreas that senses insulin requirements based on glucose levels and the body's needs and releases insulin accordingly - the ultimate goal.""'Hemoglobin A1c'' (HBA1c)''To explain what ''hemoglobin'"" A1c is, think in simple terms. Sugar sticks, and when it's around for a long time, it's harder to get it off. In the body, sugar sticks too, particularly to proteins. The ""'red blood cells'"" that circulate in the body live for about three months before they die off. When sugar sticks to these hemoglobin proteins in these cells, it is known as glycosylated hemoglobin or hemoglobin A1c (HBA1c). Measurement of HBA1c gives us an idea of how much sugar is present in the bloodstream for the preceding three months. In most labs, the normal range is 4%-5.9 %. In poorly controlled diabetes, its 8.0% or above, and in well controlled patients it's less than 7.0% (optimal is <6.5%). The benefits of measuring A1c is that is gives a more reasonable and stable view of what's happening over the course of time (three months), and the value does not vary as much as ""'finger stick'' blood sugar measurements. There is a direct correlation between A1c levels and average blood sugar levels as follows.''While there are no guidelines to use A1c as a screening tool, it gives a physician a good idea that someone is diabetic if the value is elevated. Right now, it is used as a standard tool to determine blood sugar control in patients known to have diabetes.''The American Diabetes Association currently recommends an A1c goal of less than 7.0% with A1C goal for selected individuals of as close to normal as possible (<6%) without significant ''hypoglycemia''. Other Groups such as the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists feel that an A1c of <6.5% should be the goal.''Of interest, studies have shown that there is about a 35% decrease in relative risk for microvascular disease for every 1% reduction in A1c. The closer to normal the A1c, the lower the absolute risk for microvascular complications.''It should be mentioned here that there are a number of conditions in which an A1c value may not be accurate. For example, with significant ''anemia'', the red blood cell count is low, and thus the A1c is altered. This may also be the case in ''sickle cell disease'' and other hemoglobinopathies.'  "
What are the acute complications of diabetes?,"'In patients with type 2 diabetes, ''stress'', infection, and medications (such as ''corticosteroids'') can also lead to severely elevated blood sugar levels. Accompanied by dehydration, severe blood sugar elevation in patients with type 2 diabetes can lead to an increase in blood osmolality (hyperosmolar state). This condition can worsen and lead to ''coma'' (hyperosmolar coma). A hyperosmolar coma usually occurs in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. Like diabetic ''ketoacidosis'', a hyperosmolar coma is a medical emergency. Immediate treatment with intravenous fluid and insulin is important in reversing the hyperosmolar state. Unlike patients with type 1 diabetes, patients with type 2 diabetes do not generally develop ketoacidosis solely on the basis of their diabetes. Since in general, type 2 diabetes occurs in an older population, concomitant medical conditions are more likely to be present, and these patients may actually be sicker overall. The complication and death rates from hyperosmolar coma is thus higher than in diabetic ketoacidosis.''Hypoglycemia means abnormally low blood sugar (glucose). In patients with diabetes, the most common cause of low blood sugar is excessive use of insulin or other glucose-lowering medications, to lower the blood sugar level in diabetic patients in the presence of a delayed or absent meal. When low blood sugar levels occur because of too much insulin, it is called an insulin reaction. Sometimes, low blood sugar can be the result of an insufficient caloric intake or sudden excessive physical exertion.''Blood glucose is essential for the proper functioning of brain cells. Therefore, low blood sugar can lead to central nervous system symptoms such as:''The actual level of blood sugar at which these symptoms occur varies with each person, but usually it occurs when blood sugars are less than 50 mg/dl. Untreated, severely low blood sugar levels can lead to coma, ''seizures'', and, in the worst case scenario, irreversible brain death.''The treatment of low blood sugar consists of administering a quickly absorbed glucose source. These include glucose containing drinks, such as orange juice, soft drinks (not sugar-free), or glucose tablets in doses of 15-20 grams at a time (for example, the equivalent of half a glass of juice). Even cake frosting applied inside the cheeks can work in a pinch if patient cooperation is difficult. If the individual becomes unconscious, glucagon can be given by intramuscular injection.''Glucagon is a hormone that causes the release of glucose from the liver (for example, it promotes gluconeogenesis). Glucagon can be lifesaving and every patient with diabetes who has a history of hypoglycemia (particularly those on insulin) should have a glucagon kit. Families and friends of those with diabetes need to be taught how to administer glucagon, since obviously the patients will not be able to do it themselves in an emergency situation. Another lifesaving device that should be mentioned is very simple; a medic-alert bracelet should be worn by all patients with diabetes.''Insulin is vital to patients with type 1 diabetes - they cannot live without a source of exogenous insulin. Without insulin, patients with type 1 diabetes develop severely elevated blood sugar levels. This leads to increased urine glucose, which in turn leads to excessive loss of fluid and ''electrolytes'' in the urine. Lack of insulin also causes the inability to store fat and protein along with breakdown of existing fat and protein stores. This dysregulation, results in the process of ketosis and the release of ketones into the blood. Ketones turn the blood acidic, a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''abdominal pain''. Without prompt medical treatment, patients with diabetic ketoacidosis can rapidly go into ''shock'', coma, and even death may result.''Diabetic ketoacidosis can be caused by infections, ''stress'', or trauma, all of which may increase insulin requirements. In addition, missing doses of insulin is also an obvious risk factor for developing diabetic ketoacidosis. Urgent treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis involves the intravenous administration of fluid, electrolytes, and insulin, usually in a hospital intensive care unit. Dehydration can be very severe, and it is not unusual to need to replace 6-7 liters of fluid when a person presents in diabetic ketoacidosis. Antibiotics are given for infections. With treatment, abnormal blood sugar levels, ketone production, acidosis, and dehydration can be reversed rapidly, and patients can recover remarkably well.'

What are the chronic complications of diabetes?,"'These ''diabetes complications'' are related to blood vessel diseases and are generally classified into small vessel disease, such as those involving the eyes, kidneys and nerves (microvascular disease), and large vessel disease involving the ''heart'' and blood vessels (macrovascular disease). Diabetes accelerates ''hardening of the arteries'' (atherosclerosis) of the larger blood vessels, leading to coronary ''heart disease'' (''angina'' or ''heart attack''), strokes, and ''pain'' in the lower extremities because of lack of blood supply (''claudication'').''The major eye complication of diabetes is called ''diabetic retinopathy''. ''Diabetic retinopathy'' occurs in patients who have had diabetes for at least five years. Diseased small blood vessels in the back of the eye cause the leakage of protein and blood in the retina. Disease in these blood vessels also causes the formation of small aneurysms (microaneurysms), and new but brittle blood vessels (neovascularization). Spontaneous bleeding from the new and brittle blood vessels can lead to retinal scarring and ''retinal detachment'', thus impairing vision.''To treat diabetic retinopathy, a laser is used to destroy and prevent the recurrence of the development of these small aneurysms and brittle blood vessels. Approximately 50% of patients with diabetes will develop some degree of diabetic retinopathy after 10 years of diabetes, and 80% retinopathy after 15 years of the disease. Poor control of blood sugar and ''blood pressure'' further aggravates eye disease in diabetes.''Cataracts'' and ''glaucoma'' are also more common among diabetics. It is also important to note that since the ''lens'' of the eye lets water through, if blood sugar concentrations vary a lot, the lens of the eye will shrink and swell with fluid accordingly. As a result, blurry vision is very common in poorly controlled diabetes. Patients are usually discouraged from getting a new eyeglass prescription until their blood sugar is controlled. This allows for a more accurate assessment of what kind of glasses prescription is required.''Kidney damage from diabetes is called ''diabetic nephropathy''. The onset of ''kidney disease'' and its progression is extremely variable. Initially, diseased small blood vessels in the kidneys cause the leakage of ''protein in the urine''. Later on, the kidneys lose their ability to cleanse and filter blood. The accumulation of toxic waste products in the blood leads to the need for ''dialysis''. Dialysis involves using a machine that serves the function of the kidney by filtering and cleaning the blood. In patients who do not want to undergo chronic dialysis, kidney transplantation can be considered.''The progression of nephropathy in patients can be significantly slowed by controlling ''high blood pressure'', and by aggressively treating high blood sugar levels. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (''ACE inhibitors'') or angiotensin receptor blockers (''ARBs'') used in treating ''high blood pressure'' may also benefit kidney disease in patients with diabetes.''Nerve damage from diabetes is called ''diabetic neuropathy'' and is also caused by disease of small blood vessels. In essence, the blood flow to the nerves is limited, leaving the nerves without blood flow, and they get damaged or die as a result (a term known as ischemia). Symptoms of diabetic nerve damage include numbness, burning, and aching of the feet and lower extremities. When the nerve disease causes a complete loss of sensation in the feet, patients may not be aware of injuries to the feet, and fail to properly protect them. Shoes or other protection should be worn as much as possible. Seemingly minor skin injuries should be attended to promptly to avoid serious infections. Because of poor blood circulation, diabetic foot injuries may not heal. Sometimes, minor foot injuries can lead to serious infection, ulcers, and even ''gangrene'', necessitating surgical amputation of toes, feet, and other infected parts.''Diabetic nerve damage can affect the nerves that are important for penile erection, causing ''erectile dysfunction'' (''ED'', ''impotence''). ''Erectile dysfunction'' can also be caused by poor blood flow to the penis from diabetic blood vessel disease.''Diabetic neuropathy'' can also affect nerves to the stomach and ''intestines'', causing nausea, weight loss, ''diarrhea'', and other symptoms of ''gastroparesis'' (delayed emptying of food contents from the stomach into the intestines, due to ineffective contraction of the stomach muscles).''The ''pain'' of diabetic nerve damage may respond to traditional treatments with certain medications such as ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin''), ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin''), and ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol'') that are traditionally used in the treatment of ''seizure disorders''. ''Amitriptyline'' (''Elavil'', ''Endep'') and ''desipramine'' (Norpraminine) are medications that are traditionally used for ''depression''. While many of these medications are not indicated specifically for the treatment of diabetes related ''nerve pain'', they are used by physicians commonly.''The pain of diabetic nerve damage may also improve with better blood sugar control, though unfortunately blood glucose control and the course of neuropathy do not always go hand in hand. Newer medications for nerve pain include ''Pregabalin'' (''Lyrica'') and ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta'').' "
What can be done to slow the complications of diabetes?,"'Findings from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) have clearly shown that aggressive and intensive control of elevated levels of blood sugar in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes decreases the complications of nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and may reduce the occurrence and severity of large blood vessel diseases. Aggressive control with intensive therapy means achieving fasting glucose levels between 70-120 mg/dl; glucose levels of less than 160 mg/dl after meals; and a near normal hemoglobin A1c levels (see below).''Studies in type 1 patients have shown that in intensively treated patients, ''diabetic eye disease'' decreased by 76%, kidney disease decreased by 54%, and nerve disease decreased by 60%. More recently the EDIC trial has shown that type 1 diabetes is also associated with increased heart disease, similar to type 2 diabetes. However, the price for aggressive blood sugar control is a two to three fold increase in the incidence of abnormally low blood sugar levels (caused by the ''diabetes medications''). For this reason, tight control of diabetes to achieve glucose levels between 70 to120 mg/dl is not recommended for children under 13 years of age, patients with severe recurrent hypoglycemia, patients unaware of their hypoglycemia, and patients with far advanced diabetes complications. To achieve optimal glucose control without an undue risk of abnormally lowering blood sugar levels, patients with type 1 diabetes must monitor their blood glucose at least four times a day and administer insulin at least three times per day. In patients with type 2 diabetes, aggressive blood sugar control has similar beneficial effects on the eyes, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels.' "
What is the prognosis for a person with diabetes?,"'The prognosis of diabetes is related to the extent to which the condition is kept under control to prevent the development of the complications described in the preceding sections. Some of the more serious complications of diabetes such as ''kidney failure'' and ''cardiovascular disease'', can be life-threatening. Acute complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis can also be life-threatening. As mentioned above, aggressive control of blood sugar levels can prevent or delay the onset of complications, and many people with diabetes lead long and full lives.' "
Eye problems and diabetes introduction,"'If you have ''diabetes'', regular visits to your ophthalmologist for eye exams are important to avoid ''eye problems''. ''High blood sugar'' (glucose) increases the risk of ''diabetes'' eye problems. In fact, ''diabetes'' is the leading cause of ''blindness'' in adults age 20 to 74.'""If you have eye problems and diabetes, don't buy a new pair of glasses as soon as you notice you have ""'blurred vision''. It could just be a temporary eye problem that develops rapidly with diabetes and is caused by high blood ''sugar'' levels.''High blood ''sugar'' in diabetes causes the ''lens'' of the eye to swell, which changes your ability to see. To correct this kind of eye problem, you need to get your blood sugar back into the target range (90-130 milligrams per deciliter or mg/dL before meals, and less than 180 mg/dL one to two hours after a meal). It may take as long as three months after your blood sugar is well controlled for your vision to fully get back to normal.''Blurred vision can also be a symptom of more serious eye problem with diabetes. The three major eye problems that people with diabetes may develop and should be aware of are ''cataracts'', ''glaucoma'', and retinopathy.' "
Cataracts and Diabetes,"'A ''cataract'' is a clouding or fogging of the normally clear lens of the eye. The lens is what allows us to see and focus on an image just like a camera. Although anyone can get ''cataracts'', people with diabetes get these eye problems at an earlier age than most and the condition progresses more rapidly than in people without diabetes.''If you have a ''cataract'', there is a cloudy area in the lens of your eye that results in the inability to focus light, and your vision is impaired. Symptoms of this eye problem in diabetes include blurred or glared vision.''During ''cataract surgery'', the cloudy lens is removed or cleaned out and replaced by a clear man-made lens.  '  "
Glaucoma and Diabetes,"'When fluid inside the eye does not drain properly from a buildup of pressure inside the eye, it results in another eye problem with diabetes called ''glaucoma''. The pressure damages nerves and the vessels in the eye, causing changes in vision.''Treatment of ''open-angle glaucoma'"" -- the most common form of glaucoma -- requires lowering the eye's pressure by increasing the drainage of aqueous humor or decreasing the production of the fluid. Medications can accomplish both of these goals. ""'With open-angle glaucoma, there may be no symptoms of this eye problem at all until the disease is very advanced and there is significant ''vision loss''. In the less common form of this eye problem, symptoms can include ''headaches'', eye aches or ''pain'', blurred vision, watering eyes, halos around lights, and ''loss of vision''.'""Treatment of this eye problem in diabetes can include special eye drops, laser procedures, medicine, or surgery. Surgery and laser treatments are directed at improving the eye's aqueous drainage. You can prevent serious eye problems in diabetes problems by getting an annual glaucoma screening from your eye doctor."" "
Diabetic Retinopathy,"'The retina is a group of specialized cells that convert light as it enters though the lens into images. The eye nerve or ''optic nerve'' transmits visual information to the brain.''''Diabetic retinopathy'' is one of the vascular (blood-vessel related) complications related to diabetes. This diabetes eye problem is due to damage of small vessels and is called a ""microvascular complication."" ''Kidney disease'' and nerve damage due to diabetes are also microvascular complications. Large blood vessel damage (also called macrovascular complications) includes complications like ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''.''The microvascular complications have, in numerous studies, been shown to be related to high blood sugar levels. You can reduce your risk of these eye problems in ''diabetes complications'' by improving your blood sugar control.''Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in industrialized nations. The duration of diabetes is the single most important risk for developing retinopathy. So the longer you have diabetes, the greater the risk of this very serious eye problem. If retinopathy is not found early or is not treated, it can lead to blindness.''People with ''type 1 diabetes'' rarely develop retinopathy before ''puberty''. In adults with ''type 1 diabetes'"", it is also rare to see retinopathy before five years' duration of diabetes. The risks of retinal damage increase with progressive duration of diabetes. Intensive control of blood sugar levels will reduce your risks of developing retinopathy. The DCCT, a large study of people with ""'type 1 diabetes'' showed that people with diabetes who achieved tight control of their blood sugars with either an ''insulin pump'' or multiple daily injections of ''insulin'' were 50%-75% less likely to develop retinopathy, nephropathy (kidney disease), or nerve damage (all microvascular complications).''People with ''type 2 diabetes'' usually have signs of eye problems when diabetes is diagnosed. In this case, control of blood sugar, ''blood pressure'', and blood ''cholesterol'' with diabetes have an important role in slowing the progression of retinopathy and other eye problems.''Here, it is important to address the risks factors that can worsen the occluded vessels. ''Smoking cessation'', ''high blood pressure'' control, cholesterol management, and blood sugar control must take place in order to stop the progression of new vessels from forming into the orbit of the eye. These are fragile vessels that can bleed and eventually cause a clot to form in the orbit, which ''scars'' and causes detachment of the retina. This eventually leads to irreversible vision loss.''Treatment of diabetic retinopathy may involve laser procedures or surgery. In a study of people with diabetes with early retinopathy, laser therapy to ''burn'' the fragile vessel resulted in a 50% reduction of blindness.''To prevent retinopathy with diabetes, have your eye doctor screen your eyes annually. Women with diabetes who later become ''pregnant'' should have a comprehensive eye exam during the ''first trimester'' and close follow-up with an eye doctor during the rest of their ''pregnancy'' to avoid serious eye problems with diabetes. (This recommendation does not apply to women who develop ''gestational diabetes'', since they are not at risk for retinopathy.)'   Background retinopathy. Sometimes the blood vessel damage exists, but there is no vision problem. This is called background retinopathy. It's important to carefully manage your diabetes at this stage to prevent background retinopathy from progressing to more serious eye disease. Maculopathy. In maculopathy, the person has developed damage in a critical area called the macula. Because this occurs in an area that is critical to vision, this type of eye problem can significantly reduce vision. Proliferative retinopathy. New blood vessels start to grow in the back of the eye. Because retinopathy is a microvascular complication of diabetes, a disease of small vessels, this type of retinopathy develops because of an increasing lack of oxygen to the eye from
	vascular disease. Vessels in the eye are thinned and occluded and they start to remodel."
Preventing Eye Problems With Diabetes,"'The American Diabetes Association offers these ''eye care'' guidelines for people with diabetes to help prevent eye problems:''To prevent eye problems in diabetes, you should:'  People with type 1 diabetes should have a dilated eye exam by an ophthalmologist or optometrist within three to five years after diagnosis. People with type 2 diabetes should have a dilated eye exam by an ophthalmologist or optometrist shortly after diagnosis. Annual eye exams should be done with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes by an ophthalmologist or optometrist; more frequently if necessary. When considering pregnancy, women with a history of diabetes should have an eye exam prior and during pregnancy. This does not pertain to women with gestational diabetes. Control your blood sugar Control high blood pressure"
When to Contact Your Doctor About Eye Problems in Diabetes,"'If you have diabetes, contact your doctor about any eye problems in if any of the following occur:' Black spots in your vision. Flashes of light. ""Holes"" in your vision. Blurred vision."
Kidney Disease of Diabetes Facts*,"'*''Kidney Disease'' of ''Diabetes'' Facts Medically Edited by: Melissa Conrad Stöppler, MD' Symptoms of chronic kidney disease vary greatly and can include the need to urinate frequently, especially at night; swelling of the legs and puffiness around the eyes, high blood pressure, fatigue and weakness;  loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting; itching and easy bruising; shortness of breath; headaches,sleep problems, restless legs syndrome; chest pain; bleeding; bone pain; and decreased interest in sex and erectile dysfunction. Treatment of diabetes includes control of blood glucose levels, high blood pressure, and diet; medications to treat edema and anemia, dialysis, or kidney transplant. Controlling blood glucose levels and blood pressure is the most effective way to prevent or delay kidney disease."
The Burden of Kidney Failure,"'Each year in the United States, more than 100,000 people are diagnosed with ''kidney failure'', a serious condition in which the kidneys fail to rid the body of wastes. ''Kidney failure'' is the final stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD).''Diabetes'' is the most common cause of kidney failure, accounting for nearly 44 percent of new cases. Even when diabetes is controlled, the disease can lead to chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. Most people with diabetes do not develop chronic kidney disease that is severe enough to progress to kidney failure. Nearly 24 million people in the United States have diabetes, and nearly 200,000 people are living with kidney failure as a result of diabetes.''People with kidney failure undergo either dialysis, an artificial blood-cleaning process, or transplantation to receive a healthy kidney from a donor. Most U.S. citizens who develop kidney failure are eligible for federally funded care. In 2009, care for patients with kidney failure cost the United States nearly $42 billion.''Source: United States Renal Data System. USRDS 2007 Annual Data Report.''African Americans, American Indians, and Hispanics/Latinos develop diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and kidney failure at rates higher than Caucasians. Scientists have not been able to explain these higher rates. Nor can they explain fully the interplay of factors leading to kidney disease of diabetes - factors includingheredity, ''diet'', and other medical conditions, such as ''high blood pressure''. They have found that high blood pressure and high levels ofblood glucose increase the risk that a person with diabetes will progress to kidney failure.' "
The Course of Kidney Disease,"'Diabetic kidney disease takes many years to develop. In some people, the filtering function of the kidneys is actually higher than normal in the first few years of their diabetes.'""Over several years, people who are developing kidney disease will have small amounts of the blood protein albumin begin to leak into their urine. This first stage of chronic kidney disease is called microalbuminuria. The kidney's filtration function usually remains normal during this period.""'As the disease progresses, more albumin leaks into the urine. This stage may be called macroalbuminuria or ''proteinuria'"". As the amount of albumin in the urine increases, the kidneys' filtering function usually begins to drop. The body retains various wastes as filtration falls. As kidney damage develops, blood pressure often rises as well.""'Overall, kidney damage rarely occurs in the first 10 years of diabetes, and usually 15 to 25 years will pass before kidney failure occurs. For people who live with diabetes for more than 25 years without any ''signs of kidney failure'', the risk of ever developing it decreases.' "
Diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease,"'People with diabetes should be screened regularly for kidney disease. The two key markers for kidney disease are eGFR and urine albumin.''Kidney disease is present when eGFR is less than 60 milliliters per minute.''The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommend that eGFR be calculated from serum creatinine at least once a year in all people with diabetes.''Kidney disease is present when urine contains more than 30 milligrams of albumin per gram of creatinine, with or without decreased eGFR.''The ADA and the NIH recommend annual assessment of urine albumin excretion to assess kidney damage in all people with ''type 2 diabetes'' and people who have had ''type 1 diabetes'' for 5 years or more.''If kidney disease is detected, it should be addressed as part of a comprehensive approach to the treatment of diabetes.'  eGFR. eGFR stands for estimated glomerular filtration rate. Each kidney contains about 1 million tiny filters made up of blood vessels. These filters are called glomeruli. Kidney function can be checked by estimating how much blood the glomeruli filter in a minute. The calculation of eGFR is based on the amount ofcreatinine, a waste product, found in a blood sample. As the level of creatinine goes up, the eGFR goes down. Urine albumin. Urine albumin is measured by comparing the amount of albumin to the amount of creatinine in a single urine sample. When the kidneys are healthy, the urine will contain large amounts of creatinine but almost no albumin. Even a small increase in the ratio of albumin to creatinine is a sign of kidney damage."
Effects of High Blood Pressure,"'High blood pressure, or ''hypertension'', is a major factor in the development of kidney problems in people with diabetes. Both a family history of ''hypertension'' and the presence of ''hypertension'' appear to increase chances of developing kidney disease. Hypertension also accelerates the progress of kidney disease when it already exists.''Blood pressure is recorded using two numbers. The first number is called the systolic pressure, and it represents the pressure in the arteries as the ''heart'' beats. The second number is called the diastolic pressure, and it represents the pressure between heartbeats. In the past, hypertension was defined as blood pressure higher than 140/90, said as ""140 over 90.""''The ADA and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommend that people with diabetes keep their blood pressure below 130/80.''Hypertension can be seen not only as a cause of kidney disease but also as a result of damage created by the disease. As kidney disease progresses, physical changes in the kidneys lead to increased blood pressure. Therefore, a dangerous spiral, involving rising blood pressure and factors that raise blood pressure, occurs. Early detection and treatment of even mild hypertension are essential for people with diabetes.' "
Preventing and Slowing Kidney Disease,"'Scientists have made great progress in developing methods that slow the onset and progression of kidney disease in people with diabetes. ''Drugs'' used to lower blood pressure can slow the progression of kidney disease significantly. Two types of drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (''ARBs''), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease. Many people require two or more drugs to control their blood pressure. In addition to an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a diuretic can also be useful. ''Beta blockers'', ''calcium channel blockers'', and other blood pressure drugs may also be needed.''An example of an effective ACE inhibitor is ''lisinopril'' (''Prinivil'', ''Zestril'""), which doctors commonly prescribe for treating kidney disease of diabetes. The benefits of lisinopril extend beyond its ability to lower blood pressure: it may directly protect the kidneys' glomeruli. ""'ACE inhibitors'' have lowered proteinuria and slowed deterioration even in people with diabetes who did not have high blood pressure.''An example of an effective ARB is ''losartan'' (''Cozaar''), which has also been shown to protect kidney function and lower the risk of cardiovascular events.''Any medicine that helps patients achieve a blood pressure target of 130/80 or lower provides benefits. Patients with even mild hypertension or persistent microalbuminuria should consult a health care provider about the use of antihypertensive medicines.''In people with diabetes, excessive consumption of protein may be harmful. Experts recommend that people with kidney disease of diabetes consume the recommended dietary allowance for protein, but avoid high-protein diets. For people with greatly reduced kidney function, a diet containing reduced amounts of protein may help delay the onset of kidney failure. Anyone following a reduced-''protein diet'' should work with a dietitian to ensure adequate ''nutrition''.''Antihypertensive drugs and low-protein diets can slow chronic kidney disease. A third treatment, known as intensive management of blood glucose or glycemic control, has shown great promise for people with diabetes, especially for those in the early stages of chronic kidney disease.''The ''human body'' normally converts food to glucose, the simple ''sugar'"" that is the main source of energy for the body's cells. To enter cells, glucose needs the help of ""'insulin'', a hormone produced by the pancreas. When a person does not make enough insulin, or the body does not respond to the insulin that is present, the body cannot process glucose, and it builds up in the bloodstream. High levels of glucose in the blood lead to a diagnosis of diabetes.''Intensive management of blood glucose is a treatment regimen that aims to keep blood glucose levels close to normal. The regimen includes testing blood glucose frequently, administering insulin throughout the day on the basis of food intake and physical activity, following a diet and activity plan, and consulting a health care team regularly. Some people use an ''insulin pump'' to supply insulin throughout the day.''A number of studies have pointed to the beneficial effects of intensive management of blood glucose. In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), researchers found a 50 percent decrease in both development and progression of early diabetic kidney disease in participants who followed an intensive regimen for controlling blood glucose levels. The intensively managed patients had average blood glucose levels of 150 milligrams per deciliter—about 80 milligrams per deciliter lower than the levels observed in the conventionally managed patients. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, conducted from 1976 to 1997, showed conclusively that, in people with improved blood glucose control, the risk of early kidney disease was reduced by a third. Additional studies conducted over the past decades have clearly established that any program resulting in sustained lowering of blood glucose levels will be beneficial to patients in the early stages of chronic kidney disease.' "
Dialysis and Transplantation,"'When people with diabetes experience kidney failure, they must undergo either dialysis or a kidney transplant. As recently as the 1970s, medical experts commonly excluded people with diabetes from dialysis and transplantation, in part because the experts felt damage caused by diabetes would offset benefits of the treatments. Today, because of better control of diabetes and improved rates of survival following treatment, doctors do not hesitate to offer dialysis and kidney transplantation to people with diabetes.''Currently, the survival of kidneys transplanted into people with diabetes is about the same as the survival of transplants in people without diabetes. Dialysis for people with diabetes also works well in the short run. Even so, people with diabetes who receive transplants or dialysis experience higher morbidity and mortality because of coexisting complications of diabetes—such as damage to the heart, eyes, and nerves.' "
Good Care Makes a Difference,"'People with diabetes should'  have their health care provider measure their A1C level at least twice a year. The test provides a weighted average of their blood glucose level for the previous 3 months. They should aim to keep it at less than 7 percent. work with their health care provider regarding insulin injections, medicines, meal planning, physical activity, and blood glucose monitoring. have their blood pressure checked several times a year. If blood pressure is high, they should follow their health care provider's plan for keeping it near normal levels. They should aim to keep it at less than 130/80. ask their health care provider whether they might benefit from taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB. ask their health care provider to measure their eGFR at least once a year to learn how well their kidneys are working. ask their health care provider to measure the amount of protein in their urine at least once a year to check for kidney damage. ask their health care provider whether they should reduce the amount of protein in their diet and ask for areferral to see a registered dietitian to help with meal planning."
Points to Remember," Diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) and kidney failure in the United States People with diabetes should be screened regularly for kidney disease. The two key markers for kidney disease are estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin. Drugs used to lower blood pressure can slow the progression of kidney disease significantly. Two types of drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), have proven effective in slowing the progression of kidney disease. In people with diabetes, excessive consumption of protein may be harmful. Intensive management of blood glucose has shown great promise for people with diabetes, especially for those in the early stages of chronic kidney disease."
Hope through Research,"'The number of people with diabetes is growing. As a result, the number of people with kidney failure caused by diabetes is also growing. Some experts predict that diabetes soon might account for half the cases of kidney failure. In light of the increasing illness and death related to diabetes and kidney failure, patients, researchers, and health care professionals will continue to benefit by addressing the relationship between the two diseases. The NIDDK is a leader in supporting research in this area.''Several areas of research supported by the NIDDK hold great potential. Discovery of ways to predict who will develop kidney disease may lead to greater ''prevention'', as people with diabetes who learn they are at risk institute strategies such as intensive management of blood glucose and blood pressure control.''Participants in ''clinical trials'' can play a more active role in their own health care, gain access to new research treatments before they are widely available, and help others by contributing to medical research.

What is gestational diabetes?,"'Gestational diabetes is diabetes, or ''high blood sugar'' levels, that develops during pregnancy. It occurs in about 4% of all ''pregnancies''. Gestational diabetes usually is diagnosed in the later ''stages of pregnancy'', and often occurs in women who have no prior history of diabetes.' "
How can gestational diabetes affect your baby?,"'Women with gestational diabetes who receive proper care typically go on to deliver healthy ''babies''. However, if you have persistently elevated blood glucose levels throughout pregnancy, the fetus will also have elevated blood glucose levels. High blood glucose can cause the fetus to be larger than normal, possibly making delivery more complicated. The baby is also at risk for having low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) immediately after birth.''Other serious complications of poorly controlled gestational diabetes in the ''newborn'' can include''The baby is also at a greater risk of becoming ''overweight'' and developing ''type 2 diabetes'' later in life.''If diabetes is present in an early pregnancy, there is an increased risk of ''birth defects'' and ''miscarriage'' compared to that of mothers without diabetes.' a greater risk of jaundice, an increased risk for respiratory distress syndrome, and a higher chance of dying before or following birth."
What are the warning signs and symptoms of gestational diabetes?,"'Gestational diabetes typically does not cause any noticeable signs or symptoms. This is why screening tests are so important. Rarely, an increased ''thirst'' or increased urinary frequency may be noticed.'  "
What causes gestational diabetes?,"'Gestational diabetes is thought to arise because the many changes, hormonal and otherwise, that occur in the body during pregnancy predispose some women to become resistant to ''insulin''. Insulin is a hormone made by specialized cells in the pancreas that allows the body to effectively metabolize glucose for later usage as fuel (energy). When levels of insulin are low, or the body cannot effectively use insulin (i.e., ''insulin resistance''), blood glucose levels rise.' "
What are the complications of gestational diabetes for the mother?," Women with gestational diabetes have a greater chance of needing a Cesarean birth (C-section), in part due to large infant size. Gestational diabetes may increase the risk of preeclampsia, a maternal condition characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Women with gestational diabetes are also at increased risk of having type 2 diabetes after the pregnancy."
What are risk factors for gestational diabetes?,"'Some degree of insulin resistance and ''impaired glucose tolerance'' is normal in late pregnancy. However, in some women, this is enough to produce diabetes of pregnancy, or gestational diabetes. Several risk factors that can increase your risk of getting gestational diabetes include:' Obesity A history of gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy Previous delivery of an infant with a high birth weight (over 9 pounds) A parent or sibling with type 2 diabetes A personal history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic, or Pacific Islander American ethnicity Having prediabetes"
What blood tests diagnose gestational diabetes?,"'Gestational diabetes is diagnosed with blood tests. Most pregnant women are tested between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy, but if you have risk factors, your doctor may decide to test earlier in the pregnancy.''Blood testing confirms the diagnosis. A screening ''glucose tolerance test'' involves drinking a sugary beverage and having your blood drawn to test the glucose levels an hour later. If the screening test is not normal, you may need additional testing.''Another type of test is an oral glucose challenge test (OGTT). For this test your baseline blood glucose level is checked and then measured at 1, 2, and sometimes 3 hours after consuming a sugary drink. A blood glucose level of 140mg/dL or higher on this test will identify 80% of women with gestational diabetes. When that cutoff is lowered to 130mg/dL, the identification rate increases to 90%. Women who had a level of blood glucose greater than 130 mg/dL are typically recommended to take another diabetes screening test that requires fasting (not eating anything) before the test.''Glycosylated ''hemoglobin'', or ''hemoglobin A1c'', is another test that may be performed. This test is used to monitor long-term blood glucose levels in people with diabetes. The hemoglobin A1c level offers a measure of the average blood glucose level over the past few months.' "
Should all pregnant women get tested for gestational diabetes?,'All pregnant women should be screened for gestational diabetes during their pregnancy. Most pregnant women are tested between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy.' 
What is the treatment for gestational diabetes?,"'It is important to receive proper treatment for gestational diabetes because research studies have shown that the incidence of problems and complications is decreased when blood glucose levels are normalized. Treatment for gestational diabetes involves attention to maintaining a proper ''diet''. Nutritional modification is the mainstay of therapy, and many women will achieve adequate glucose control by following a nutritional plan. Regular ''exercise'' can also contribute to tight glucose control.''Testing your blood glucose levels at home at specific times or after meals will be recommended to determine if your glucose levels are within acceptable limits. Testing at least four times per day is typical.''You may also be asked to test your urine for ketones, substances that are produced when your body metabolizes fat. Ketones are elevated when the body is unable to use glucose for energy.''If ''diet'' and ''exercise'' are not sufficient to maintain tight control of your blood glucose levels, it may be necessary to institute insulin therapy. Insulin is the only officially approved medication for treating gestational diabetes in the U.S.; however, oral medications are used by many doctors to control the blood ''sugar'' in selected women with gestational diabetes. As the pregnancy progresses, insulin requirements may change and insulin doses may need to be adjusted.'  "
Is there a special diet plan for women with diabetes during pregnancy?,"'While there is no one specific diet that is recommended for all women with gestational diabetes, following a meal plan can help keep your blood ''sugar'' levels under control and avoid complications.' A nutritionist may be helpful in designing a meal plan that takes into account individual schedules and preferences. Eating a variety of foods is recommended, and it is better to eat smaller portions throughout the day (e.g. 3 small to moderate meals and 2-4 snacks) rather than just a few large meals. Many women with gestational diabetes will be advised to eat fewer carbohydrates than in their normal diet and to eat complex carbohydrates that contain fiber. It’s important to limit consumption of foods containing large amounts of simple sugars. High-fiber foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as whole-grain products, are not only nutritious but also effective in keeping blood sugar levels stable. Skipping meals is not recommended because this leads to undesirable fluctuations in blood sugar levels."
Can gestational diabetes be cured?,"'Most women with gestational diabetes who receive treatment go on to deliver healthy babies. The risk of complications increases when blood glucose levels are not properly controlled. While some women with gestational diabetes will develop type 2 diabetes following delivery, this risk can be reduced by following a good nutritional plan, exercising, and maintaining a healthy weight.' "
Can you prevent diabetes during pregnancy?,"'Gestational diabetes cannot always be prevented; however, obesity is a prime determinant for developing the disease. Maintaining a healthy weight and following a good nutritional plan both before and during pregnancy can decrease your chances of developing gestational diabetes. Maintaining a healthy weight can also decrease your chances of developing type 2 diabetes following pregnancy.' "
What is diabetes insipidus?,"'Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a disorder of water balance. The body normally balances fluid intake with the excretion of fluid in urine. However, people with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus produce too much urine (polyuria), which causes them to be excessively thirsty (polydipsia). Affected individuals can quickly become dehydrated if they do not drink enough water, especially in hot weather or when they are sick.''Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be either acquired or hereditary. The acquired form is brought on by certain ''drugs'' and chronic diseases and can occur at any time during life. The hereditary form is caused by genetic mutations, and its signs and symptoms usually become apparent within the first few months of life.'  "
What are the symptoms of diabetes insipidus in infants?,"'Infants with hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus may eat poorly and fail to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive). They may also be irritable and experience ''fevers'', ''diarrhea'', and ''vomiting''. Recurrent episodes of ''dehydration'' can lead to slow growth and delayed development. If the condition is not well-managed, over time it can damage the bladder and kidneys leading to ''pain'', infections, and ''kidney failure''. With appropriate treatment, affected individuals usually have few complications and a normal lifespan.' "
Are diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus the same condition?,"'Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus should not be confused with diabetes mellitus, which is much more common. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by ''high blood sugar'' levels resulting from a shortage of the hormone ''insulin'' or an insensitivity to this hormone. Although nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus have some features in common, they are separate disorders with different causes.'  "
Is diabetes insipidus inherited?,"'When nephrogenic diabetes insipidus results from mutations in the AVPR2 gene, the condition has an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. The AVPR2 gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation usually has to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. However, some females who carry a single mutated copy of the AVPR2 gene have features of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, including polyuria and polydipsia. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.''When nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by mutations in the AQP2 gene, it can have either an autosomal recessive or, less commonly, an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. In autosomal recessive inheritance, both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. In autosomal dominant inheritance, one mutated copy of the AQP2 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.'  "
What tests and procedures diagnose diabetes insipidus?,"'A healthcare professional can diagnose a person with diabetes insipidus based on;'""Taking a medical and family history can help a health care provider diagnose diabetes insipidus. A health care provider will ask the patient to review his or her symptoms and ask whether the patient's family has a history of diabetes insipidus or its symptoms.""""A physical exam can help diagnose diabetes insipidus. During a physical exam, a health care provider usually examines the patient's skin and appearance, checking for signs of ""'dehydration''.'""Urinalysis tests a urine sample. A patient collects the urine sample in a special container at home, in a health care provider's office, or at a commercial facility. A health care provider tests the sample in the same location or sends it to a lab for analysis. The test can show whether the urine is dilute or concentrated. The test can also show the presence of glucose, which can distinguish between diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus. The health care provider may also have the patient collect urine in a special container over a 24-hour period to measure the total amount of urine produced by the kidneys.""""A blood test involves drawing a patient's blood at a health care provider’s office or a commercial facility and sending the sample to a lab for analysis. The blood test measures sodium levels, which can help diagnose diabetes insipidus and in some cases determine the type.""'A fluid deprivation test measures changes in a patient’s body weight and urine concentration after restricting liquid intake. A health care provider can perform two types of fluid deprivation tests:''A short form of the deprivation test.'' A health care provider instructs the patient to stop drinking all liquids for a specific period of time, usually during dinner. The next morning, the patient will collect a urine sample at home. The patient then returns the urine sample to his or her health care provider or takes it to a lab where a technician measures the concentration of the urine sample.''A formal fluid deprivation test.'"" A health care provider performs this test in a hospital to continuously monitor the patient for signs of dehydration. Patients do not need anesthesia. A health care provider weighs the patient and analyzes a urine sample. The health care provider repeats the tests and measures the patient's ""'blood pressure'' every 1 to 2 hours until one of the following happens:'""At the end of the test, a healthcare provider will compare the patient's blood sodium, vasopressin levels, and urine concentration to determine whether the patient has diabetes insipidus. Sometimes, the health care provider may administer medications during the test to see if they increase a patient's urine concentration. In other cases, the health care provider may give the patient a concentrated sodium solution intravenously at the end of the test to increase the patient's blood sodium level and determine if he or she has diabetes insipidus.""""Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a test that takes pictures of the body's internal organs and soft tissues without using ""'x-rays''.

Treatment for frequent urination or constant ''thirst'"" depends on the patient's type of diabetes insipidus:""'Researchers have not found that eating, ''diet'', and ''nutrition'' play a role in causing or preventing diabetes insipidus.' Central diabetes insipidus. A synthetic, or man-made, hormone called desmopressin treats central diabetes insipidus. The medication comes as an injection, a nasal spray, or a pill. The medication works by replacing the vasopressin that a patient’s body normally produces. This treatment helps a patient manage symptoms of central diabetes insipidus; however, it does not cure the disease. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In some cases, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus goes away after treatment of the cause. For example, switching medications or taking steps to balance the amount of calcium or potassium in the patient’s body may resolve the problem. Medications for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus include diuretics, either alone or combined with aspirin or ibuprofen. Diuretics. Doctors commonly prescribe diuretics to help patients’ kidneys remove fluid from the body. Paradoxically, in people with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a class of diuretics called thiazides reduces urine production and helps patients’ kidneys concentrate urine. Aspirin or ibuprofen also helps reduce urine volume. Dipsogenic diabetes insipidus. Researchers have not yet found an effective treatment for dipsogenic diabetes insipidus. People can try sucking on ice chips or sour candies to moisten their mouths and increase saliva flow, which may reduce the desire to drink. For a person who wakes multiple times at night to urinate because of dipsogenic diabetes insipidus, taking a small dose of desmopressin at bedtime may help. Initially, the health care provider will monitor the patient’s blood sodium levels to prevent hyponatremia, or low sodium levels in the blood. Gestational diabetes insipidus. A doctor can prescribe desmopressin for women with gestational diabetes insipidus. An expecting mother’s placenta does not destroy desmopressin as it does vasopressin. Most women will not need treatment after delivery. Complications. Most people with diabetes insipidus can prevent serious problems and live a normal life if they follow the team of healthcare professionals recommendations and keep their symptoms under control."

What should I know about diabetes type 1 and type 2?,"'Diabetes'' Type 1 and Type 2 facts''How does diabetes make you feel?'   Diabetes is a chronic condition associated with abnormally high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Insulin produced by the pancreas lowers blood glucose. Absence or insufficient production of insulin, or an inability of the body to properly use insulin causes diabetes. The two types of diabetes are referred to as type 1 and type 2. Former names for these conditions were insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes, or juvenile onset and adult-onset diabetes. Some of the risk factors for getting diabetes include being overweight or obese, leading a sedentary lifestyle, a family history of diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), and low levels of the ""good"" cholesterol (HDL) and elevated levels of triglycerides in the blood. If you think you may have prediabetes or diabetes contact a health-care professional. Symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes includeincreased urine output,excessive thirst,weight loss,hunger,fatigue,skin problemsslow healing wounds,yeast infections, andtingling or numbness in the feet or toes. increased urine output, excessive thirst, weight loss, hunger, fatigue, skin problems slow healing wounds, yeast infections, and tingling or numbness in the feet or toes."
What is diabetes?,"'Diabetes mellitus'' is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by ''high blood sugar'' (glucose) levels that result from defects in insulin secretion, or its action, or both. Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes (as it will be in this article) was first identified as a disease associated with ""sweet urine,"" and excessive muscle loss in the ancient world. Elevated levels of blood glucose (''hyperglycemia'') lead to spillage of glucose into the urine, hence the term sweet urine.''Normally, blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin lowers the blood glucose level. When the blood glucose elevates (for example, after eating food), insulin is released from the pancreas to normalize the glucose level by promoting the uptake of glucose into body cells. In patients with diabetes, the absence of insufficient production of or lack of response to insulin causes hyperglycemia. Diabetes is a chronic medical condition, meaning that although it can be controlled, it lasts a lifetime.' "
How many people in the US have diabetes?," Diabetes affects approximately 30.3 million people (9.4% of the population) in the United States, while another estimated 84.1 million people have prediabetes and don't know it. An estimated 7.2 million people in the United States have diabetes and don't even know it. Over time, diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney failure, and nerve damage. These types of damage are the result of damage to small vessels, referred to as microvascular disease. Diabetes also is an important factor in accelerating the hardening and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis), leading to strokes, coronary heart disease, and other large blood vessel diseases. This is referred to as macrovascular disease. From an economic perspective, the total annual cost of diabetes in 2012 was estimated to be 245 billion dollars in the United States. This included 116 billion in direct medical costs (healthcare costs) for people with diabetes and another 69 billion in other costs due to disability, premature death, or work loss. Medical expenses for people with diabetes are over two times higher than those for people who do not have diabetes. Remember, these numbers reflect only the population in the United States. Globally, the statistics are staggering. Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of death in the United States listed on death certificates in recent years."
9 early signs and symptoms of diabetes,"   The early symptoms of untreated diabetes are related to elevated blood sugar levels, and loss of glucose in the urine. High amounts of glucose in the urine can cause increased urine output (frequent urination) and lead to dehydration. The dehydration also causes increased thirst and water consumption. A relative or absolute insulin deficiency eventually leads to weight loss. The weight loss of diabetes occurs despite an increase in appetite. Some untreated diabetes patients also complain of fatigue. Nausea and vomiting can also occur in patients with untreated diabetes. Frequent infections (such as infections of the bladder, skin, and vaginal areas) are more likely to occur in people with untreated or poorly-controlled diabetes. Fluctuations in blood glucose levels can lead to blurred vision. Extremely elevated glucose levels can lead to lethargy and coma."
How do I know if I have diabetes?," Many people are unaware that they have diabetes, especially in its early stages when symptoms may not be present. There is no definite way to know if you have diabetes without undergoing blood tests to determine your blood glucose levels (see section on Diagnosis of diabetes). See your doctor if you have symptoms of diabetes or if you are concerned about your diabetes risk."
What causes diabetes?,"""Insufficient production of insulin (either absolutely or relative to the body's needs), production of defective insulin (which is uncommon), or the inability of cells to use insulin properly and efficiently leads to hyperglycemia and diabetes.""'In ''type 2 diabetes'', there also is a steady decline of beta cells that adds to the process of elevated blood sugars. Essentially, if someone is resistant to insulin, the body can, to some degree, increase production of insulin and overcome the level of resistance. After time, if production decreases and insulin cannot be released as vigorously, hyperglycemia develops.''What is glucose?''Glucose is a simple sugar found in food. Glucose is an essential nutrient that provides energy for the proper functioning of the body cells. Carbohydrates are broken down in the small intestine and the glucose in digested food is then absorbed by the intestinal cells into the bloodstream, and is carried by the bloodstream to all the cells in the body where it is utilized. However, glucose cannot enter the cells alone and needs insulin to aid in its transport into the cells. Without insulin, the cells become starved of glucose energy despite the presence of abundant glucose in the bloodstream. In certain types of diabetes, the cells\' inability to utilize glucose gives rise to the ironic situation of ""starvation in the midst of plenty"". The abundant, unutilized glucose is wastefully excreted in the urine.''What is insulin?'""Insulin is a hormone that is produced by specialized cells (beta cells) of the pancreas. (The pancreas is a deep-seated organ in the abdomen located behind the stomach.) In addition to helping glucose enter the cells, insulin is also important in tightly regulating the level of glucose in the blood. After a meal, the blood glucose level rises. In response to the increased glucose level, the pancreas normally releases more insulin into the bloodstream to help glucose enter the cells and lower blood glucose levels after a meal. When the blood glucose levels are lowered, the insulin release from the pancreas is turned down. It is important to note that even in the fasting state there is a low steady release of insulin than fluctuates a bit and helps to maintain a steady blood sugar level during fasting. In normal individuals, such a regulatory system helps to keep blood glucose levels in a tightly controlled range. As outlined above, in patients with diabetes, the insulin is either absent, relatively insufficient for the body's needs, or not used properly by the body. All of these factors cause elevated levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia).""   This latter condition affects mostly the cells of muscle and fat tissues, and results in a condition known as insulin resistance. This is the primary problem in type 2 diabetes. The absolute lack of insulin, usually secondary to a destructive process affecting the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, is the main disorder in type 1 diabetes."
What are the risk factors for diabetes?,"'Risk factors for ''type 1 diabetes'' are not as well understood as those for type 2 diabetes. Family history is a known risk factor for ''type 1 diabetes''. Other risk factors can include having certain infections or diseases of the pancreas.''Risk factors for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes are many. The following can raise your risk of developing type 2 diabetes:' Being obese or overweight High blood pressure Elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of ""good"" cholesterol (HDL) Sedentary lifestyle Family history Increasing age Polycystic ovary syndrome Impaired glucose tolerance  Insulin resistance Gestational diabetes during a pregnancy Ethnic background: Hispanic/Latino Americans, African-Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Alaska natives are at greater risk."
What are the different types of diabetes?,"""There are two major types of diabetes, called type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes was also formerly called insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), or juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas undergoes an autoimmune attack by the body itself, and is rendered incapable of making insulin. Abnormal antibodies have been found in the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes. Antibodies are proteins in the blood that are part of the body's immune system. The patient with type 1 diabetes must rely on insulin medication for survival."" "
What is type 1 diabetes?,"""In autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly manufactures antibodies and inflammatory cells that are directed against and cause damage to patients' own body tissues. In persons with type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas, which are responsible for insulin production, are attacked by the misdirected immune system. It is believed that the tendency to develop abnormal antibodies in type 1 diabetes is, in part, genetically ""'inherited'', though the details are not fully understood.''Exposure to certain viral infections (''mumps'' and Coxsackie ''viruses'') or other environmental toxins may serve to trigger abnormal antibody responses that cause damage to the pancreas cells where insulin is made. Some of the antibodies seen in type 1 diabetes include anti-islet cell antibodies, anti-insulin antibodies and anti-glutamic decarboxylase antibodies. These antibodies can be detected in the majority of patients, and may help determine which individuals are at risk for developing type 1 diabetes.''At present, the American Diabetes Association does not recommend general screening of the population for type 1 diabetes, though screening of high risk individuals, such as those with a first degree relative (sibling or parent) with type 1 diabetes should be encouraged. Type 1 diabetes tends to occur in young, lean individuals, usually before 30 years of age; however, older patients do present with this form of diabetes on occasion. This subgroup is referred to as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). LADA is a slow, progressive form of type 1 diabetes. Of all the people with diabetes, only approximately 10% have type 1 diabetes and the remaining 90% have type 2 diabetes.' "
What is type 2 diabetes?,"""Type 2 diabetes was also previously referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), or adult-onset diabetes mellitus (AODM). In type 2 diabetes, patients can still produce insulin, but do so relatively inadequately for their body's needs, particularly in the face of insulin resistance as discussed above. In many cases this actually means the pancreas produces larger than normal quantities of insulin. A major feature of type 2 diabetes is a lack of sensitivity to insulin by the cells of the body (particularly fat and muscle cells).""'In addition to the problems with an increase in insulin resistance, the release of insulin by the pancreas may also be defective and suboptimal. In fact, there is a known steady decline in beta cell production of insulin in type 2 diabetes that contributes to worsening glucose control. (This is a major factor for many patients with type 2 diabetes who ultimately require insulin therapy.) Finally, the ''liver'' in these patients continues to produce glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis despite elevated glucose levels. The control of gluconeogenesis becomes compromised.''While it is said that type 2 diabetes occurs mostly in individuals over 30 years old and the incidence increases with age, an alarming number of patients with type 2 diabetes are barely in their teen years. Most of these cases are a direct result of poor eating habits, higher body weight, and lack of ''exercise''.''While there is a strong genetic component to developing this form of diabetes, there are other risk factors - the most significant of which is ''obesity''. There is a direct relationship between the degree of obesity and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and this holds true in children as well as adults. It is estimated that the chance to develop diabetes doubles for every 20% increase over desirable body weight.''Regarding age, data shows that for each decade after 40 years of age regardless of weight there is an increase in incidence of diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes in persons 65 years of age and older is around 25%. Type 2 diabetes is also more common in certain ethnic groups. Compared with a 7% prevalence in non-Hispanic Caucasians, the prevalence in Asian Americans is estimated to be 8.0%, in Hispanics 13%, in blacks around 12.3%, and in certain Native American communities 20% to 50%. Finally, diabetes occurs much more frequently in women with a prior history of diabetes that develops during pregnancy (''gestational diabetes'').' "
What are the other types of diabetes?,"'Diabetes can occur temporarily during pregnancy, and reports suggest that it occurs in 2% to 10% of all ''pregnancies''. Significant hormonal changes during pregnancy can lead to blood sugar elevation in genetically predisposed individuals. Blood sugar elevation during pregnancy is called gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes usually resolves once the baby is born. However, 35% to 60% of women with gestational diabetes will eventually develop type 2 diabetes over the next 10 to 20 years, especially in those who require insulin during pregnancy and those who remain overweight after their delivery. Women with gestational diabetes are usually asked to undergo an ''oral glucose tolerance test'' about six weeks after giving birth to determine if their diabetes has persisted beyond the pregnancy, or if any evidence (such as impaired glucose tolerance) is present that may be a clue to a risk for developing diabetes.''""Secondary"" diabetes refers to elevated blood sugar levels from another medical condition. Secondary diabetes may develop when the pancreatic tissue responsible for the production of insulin is destroyed by disease, such as ''chronic pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas by toxins like excessive ''alcohol''), ''trauma'', or surgical removal of the pancreas.'""Diabetes can also result from other hormonal disturbances, such as excessive growth hormone production (acromegaly) and Cushing's syndrome. In acromegaly, a ""'pituitary gland'' ''tumor'"" at the base of the brain causes excessive production of growth hormone, leading to hyperglycemia. In Cushing's syndrome, the adrenal glands produce an excess of cortisol, which promotes blood sugar elevation.""'Certain medications may worsen diabetes control, or ""unmask"" latent diabetes. This is seen most commonly when steroid medications (such as ''prednisone'') are taken and also with medications used in the treatment of ''HIV'' infection (''AIDS'').' "
What kind of doctor treats diabetes?,"'Endocrinology is the specialty of medicine that deals with hormone disturbances, and both endocrinologists and pediatric endocrinologists manage patients with diabetes. People with diabetes may also be treated by family medicine or internal medicine specialists. When complications arise, people with diabetes may be treated by other specialists, including neurologists, gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists, surgeons, cardiologists, or others.' "
How is diabetes diagnosed?,"'The  ''fasting blood glucose'"" (sugar) test is the preferred way to diagnose diabetes. It is easy to perform and convenient. After the person has fasted overnight (at least 8 hours), a single sample of blood is drawn and sent to the laboratory for analysis. This can also be done accurately in a doctor's office using a glucose meter.""'When fasting blood glucose stays above 100mg/dl, but in the range of 100-126mg/dl, this is known as impaired fasting glucose (IFG). While patients with IFG or prediabetes do not have the diagnosis of diabetes, this condition carries with it its own risks and concerns, and is addressed elsewhere.''Though not routinely used any longer, the oral ''glucose tolerance test'' (OGTT) is a gold standard for making the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It is still commonly used for diagnosing gestational diabetes and in conditions of pre-diabetes, such as polycystic ovary syndrome. With an oral glucose tolerance test, the person fasts overnight (at least eight but not more than 16 hours). Then first, the fasting plasma glucose is tested. After this test, the person receives an oral dose (75 grams) of glucose. There are several methods employed by obstetricians to do this test, but the one described here is standard. Usually, the glucose is in a sweet-tasting liquid that the person ''drinks''. Blood samples are taken at specific intervals to measure the blood glucose.''For the test to give reliable results:''The classic oral glucose tolerance test measures blood glucose levels five times over a period of three hours. Some physicians simply get a baseline blood sample followed by a sample two hours after drinking the glucose solution. In a person without diabetes, the glucose levels rise and then fall quickly. In someone with diabetes, glucose levels rise higher than normal and fail to come back down as fast.''People with glucose levels between normal and diabetic have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or insulin resistance. People with impaired glucose tolerance do not have diabetes, but are at high risk for progressing to diabetes. Each year, 1% to 5% of people whose test results show impaired glucose tolerance actually eventually develop diabetes. Weight loss and ''exercise'' may help people with impaired glucose tolerance return their glucose levels to normal. In addition, some physicians advocate the use of medications, such as ''metformin'' (''Glucophage''), to help prevent/delay the onset of overt diabetes.''Research has shown that impaired glucose tolerance itself may be a risk factor for the development of ''heart disease''. In the medical community, most physicians now understand that impaired glucose tolerance is not simply a precursor of diabetes, but is its own clinical disease entity that requires treatment and monitoring.''Glucose tolerance tests may lead to one of the following diagnoses:' Normal fasting plasma glucose levels are less than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Fasting plasma glucose levels of more than 126 mg/dl on two or more tests on different days indicate diabetes. A random blood glucose test can also be used to diagnose diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dl or higher indicates diabetes. The person must be in good health (not have any other illnesses, not even a cold). The person should be normally active (not lying down, for example, as an inpatient in a hospital), and The person should not be taking medicines that could affect the blood glucose. The morning of the test, the person should not smoke or drink coffee. Normal response: A person is said to have a normal response when the 2-hour glucose level is less than 140 mg/dl, and all values between 0 and 2 hours are less than 200 mg/dl. Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes): A person is said to have impaired glucose tolerance when the fasting plasma glucose is less than 126 mg/dl and the 2-hour glucose level is between 140 and 199 mg/dl. Diabetes: A person has diabetes when two diagnostic tests done on different days show that the blood glucose level is high. Gestational diabetes:  A pregnant woman has gestational diabetes when she has any two of the following:, a fasting plasma glucose of 92 mg/dl or more, a 1-hour glucose level of 180 mg/dl or more, or a 2-hour glucose level of 153 mg/dl, or more."
Why is blood sugar checked at home?,"'Home blood sugar (glucose) testing is an important part of controlling blood sugar. One important goal of ''diabetes treatment'' is to keep the blood glucose levels near the normal range of 70 to 120 mg/dl before meals and under 140 mg/dl at two hours after eating. Blood glucose levels are usually tested before and after meals, and at bedtime. The blood sugar level is typically determined by pricking a fingertip with a lancing device and applying the blood to a glucose meter, which reads the value. There are many meters on the market, for example, Accu-Check Advantage, One Touch Ultra, Sure Step and Freestyle. Each meter has its own advantages and disadvantages (some use less blood, some have a larger digital readout, some take a shorter time to give you results, etc.). The test results are then used to help patients make adjustments in medications, diets, and physical activities.''There are some interesting developments in blood glucose monitoring including continuous glucose sensors. The new continuous glucose sensor systems involve an implantable cannula placed just under the skin in the abdomen or in the arm. This cannula allows for frequent sampling of blood glucose levels. Attached to this is a transmitter that sends the data to a pager-like device. This device has a visual screen that allows the wearer to see, not only the current glucose reading, but also the graphic trends. In some devices, the rate of change of blood sugar is also shown. There are alarms for low and high sugar levels. Certain models will alarm if the rate of change indicates the wearer is at risk for dropping or rising blood glucose too rapidly. One version is specifically designed to interface with their insulin pumps. In most cases the patient still must manually approve any insulin dose (the pump cannot blindly respond to the glucose information it receives, it can only give a calculated suggestion as to whether the wearer should give insulin, and if so, how much). However, in 2013 the US FDA approved the first artificial pancreas type device, meaning an implanted sensor and pump combination that stops insulin delivery when glucose levels reach a certain low point. All of these devices need to be correlated to fingersticks measurements for a few hours before they can function independently. The devices can then provide readings for 3 to 5 days.''Diabetes experts feel that these blood glucose monitoring devices give patients a significant amount of independence to manage their disease process; and they are a great tool for education as well. It is also important to remember that these devices can be used intermittently with fingerstick measurements. For example, a well-controlled patient with diabetes can rely on fingerstick glucose checks a few times a day and do well. If they become ill, if they decide to embark on a new exercise regimen, if they change their ''diet'"" and so on, they can use the sensor to supplement their fingerstick regimen, providing more information on how they are responding to new lifestyle changes or stressors. This kind of system takes us one step closer to closing the loop, and to the development of an artificial pancreas that senses insulin requirements based on glucose levels and the body's needs and releases insulin accordingly - the ultimate goal.""'Hemoglobin A1c'' (HBA1c)''To explain what ''hemoglobin'"" A1c is, think in simple terms. Sugar sticks, and when it's around for a long time, it's harder to get it off. In the body, sugar sticks too, particularly to proteins. The ""'red blood cells'"" that circulate in the body live for about three months before they die off. When sugar sticks to these hemoglobin proteins in these cells, it is known as glycosylated hemoglobin or hemoglobin A1c (HBA1c). Measurement of HBA1c gives us an idea of how much sugar is present in the bloodstream for the preceding three months. In most labs, the normal range is 4%-5.9 %. In poorly controlled diabetes, its 8.0% or above, and in well controlled patients it's less than 7.0% (optimal is <6.5%). The benefits of measuring A1c is that is gives a more reasonable and stable view of what's happening over the course of time (three months), and the value does not vary as much as ""'finger stick'' blood sugar measurements. There is a direct correlation between A1c levels and average blood sugar levels as follows.''While there are no guidelines to use A1c as a screening tool, it gives a physician a good idea that someone is diabetic if the value is elevated. Right now, it is used as a standard tool to determine blood sugar control in patients known to have diabetes.''The American Diabetes Association currently recommends an A1c goal of less than 7.0% with A1C goal for selected individuals of as close to normal as possible (<6%) without significant ''hypoglycemia''. Other Groups such as the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists feel that an A1c of <6.5% should be the goal.''Of interest, studies have shown that there is about a 35% decrease in relative risk for microvascular disease for every 1% reduction in A1c. The closer to normal the A1c, the lower the absolute risk for microvascular complications.''It should be mentioned here that there are a number of conditions in which an A1c value may not be accurate. For example, with significant ''anemia'', the red blood cell count is low, and thus the A1c is altered. This may also be the case in ''sickle cell disease'' and other hemoglobinopathies.'  "
What are the acute complications of diabetes?,"'In patients with type 2 diabetes, ''stress'', infection, and medications (such as ''corticosteroids'') can also lead to severely elevated blood sugar levels. Accompanied by dehydration, severe blood sugar elevation in patients with type 2 diabetes can lead to an increase in blood osmolality (hyperosmolar state). This condition can worsen and lead to ''coma'' (hyperosmolar coma). A hyperosmolar coma usually occurs in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. Like diabetic ''ketoacidosis'', a hyperosmolar coma is a medical emergency. Immediate treatment with intravenous fluid and insulin is important in reversing the hyperosmolar state. Unlike patients with type 1 diabetes, patients with type 2 diabetes do not generally develop ketoacidosis solely on the basis of their diabetes. Since in general, type 2 diabetes occurs in an older population, concomitant medical conditions are more likely to be present, and these patients may actually be sicker overall. The complication and death rates from hyperosmolar coma is thus higher than in diabetic ketoacidosis.''Hypoglycemia means abnormally low blood sugar (glucose). In patients with diabetes, the most common cause of low blood sugar is excessive use of insulin or other glucose-lowering medications, to lower the blood sugar level in diabetic patients in the presence of a delayed or absent meal. When low blood sugar levels occur because of too much insulin, it is called an insulin reaction. Sometimes, low blood sugar can be the result of an insufficient caloric intake or sudden excessive physical exertion.''Blood glucose is essential for the proper functioning of brain cells. Therefore, low blood sugar can lead to central nervous system symptoms such as:''The actual level of blood sugar at which these symptoms occur varies with each person, but usually it occurs when blood sugars are less than 50 mg/dl. Untreated, severely low blood sugar levels can lead to coma, ''seizures'', and, in the worst case scenario, irreversible brain death.''The treatment of low blood sugar consists of administering a quickly absorbed glucose source. These include glucose containing drinks, such as orange juice, soft drinks (not sugar-free), or glucose tablets in doses of 15-20 grams at a time (for example, the equivalent of half a glass of juice). Even cake frosting applied inside the cheeks can work in a pinch if patient cooperation is difficult. If the individual becomes unconscious, glucagon can be given by intramuscular injection.''Glucagon is a hormone that causes the release of glucose from the liver (for example, it promotes gluconeogenesis). Glucagon can be lifesaving and every patient with diabetes who has a history of hypoglycemia (particularly those on insulin) should have a glucagon kit. Families and friends of those with diabetes need to be taught how to administer glucagon, since obviously the patients will not be able to do it themselves in an emergency situation. Another lifesaving device that should be mentioned is very simple; a medic-alert bracelet should be worn by all patients with diabetes.''Insulin is vital to patients with type 1 diabetes - they cannot live without a source of exogenous insulin. Without insulin, patients with type 1 diabetes develop severely elevated blood sugar levels. This leads to increased urine glucose, which in turn leads to excessive loss of fluid and ''electrolytes'' in the urine. Lack of insulin also causes the inability to store fat and protein along with breakdown of existing fat and protein stores. This dysregulation, results in the process of ketosis and the release of ketones into the blood. Ketones turn the blood acidic, a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''abdominal pain''. Without prompt medical treatment, patients with diabetic ketoacidosis can rapidly go into ''shock'', coma, and even death may result.''Diabetic ketoacidosis can be caused by infections, ''stress'', or trauma, all of which may increase insulin requirements. In addition, missing doses of insulin is also an obvious risk factor for developing diabetic ketoacidosis. Urgent treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis involves the intravenous administration of fluid, electrolytes, and insulin, usually in a hospital intensive care unit. Dehydration can be very severe, and it is not unusual to need to replace 6-7 liters of fluid when a person presents in diabetic ketoacidosis. Antibiotics are given for infections. With treatment, abnormal blood sugar levels, ketone production, acidosis, and dehydration can be reversed rapidly, and patients can recover remarkably well.'

What are the chronic complications of diabetes?,"'These ''diabetes complications'' are related to blood vessel diseases and are generally classified into small vessel disease, such as those involving the eyes, kidneys and nerves (microvascular disease), and large vessel disease involving the ''heart'' and blood vessels (macrovascular disease). Diabetes accelerates ''hardening of the arteries'' (atherosclerosis) of the larger blood vessels, leading to coronary ''heart disease'' (''angina'' or ''heart attack''), strokes, and ''pain'' in the lower extremities because of lack of blood supply (''claudication'').''The major eye complication of diabetes is called ''diabetic retinopathy''. ''Diabetic retinopathy'' occurs in patients who have had diabetes for at least five years. Diseased small blood vessels in the back of the eye cause the leakage of protein and blood in the retina. Disease in these blood vessels also causes the formation of small aneurysms (microaneurysms), and new but brittle blood vessels (neovascularization). Spontaneous bleeding from the new and brittle blood vessels can lead to retinal scarring and ''retinal detachment'', thus impairing vision.''To treat diabetic retinopathy, a laser is used to destroy and prevent the recurrence of the development of these small aneurysms and brittle blood vessels. Approximately 50% of patients with diabetes will develop some degree of diabetic retinopathy after 10 years of diabetes, and 80% retinopathy after 15 years of the disease. Poor control of blood sugar and ''blood pressure'' further aggravates eye disease in diabetes.''Cataracts'' and ''glaucoma'' are also more common among diabetics. It is also important to note that since the ''lens'' of the eye lets water through, if blood sugar concentrations vary a lot, the lens of the eye will shrink and swell with fluid accordingly. As a result, blurry vision is very common in poorly controlled diabetes. Patients are usually discouraged from getting a new eyeglass prescription until their blood sugar is controlled. This allows for a more accurate assessment of what kind of glasses prescription is required.''Kidney damage from diabetes is called ''diabetic nephropathy''. The onset of ''kidney disease'' and its progression is extremely variable. Initially, diseased small blood vessels in the kidneys cause the leakage of ''protein in the urine''. Later on, the kidneys lose their ability to cleanse and filter blood. The accumulation of toxic waste products in the blood leads to the need for ''dialysis''. Dialysis involves using a machine that serves the function of the kidney by filtering and cleaning the blood. In patients who do not want to undergo chronic dialysis, kidney transplantation can be considered.''The progression of nephropathy in patients can be significantly slowed by controlling ''high blood pressure'', and by aggressively treating high blood sugar levels. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (''ACE inhibitors'') or angiotensin receptor blockers (''ARBs'') used in treating ''high blood pressure'' may also benefit kidney disease in patients with diabetes.''Nerve damage from diabetes is called ''diabetic neuropathy'' and is also caused by disease of small blood vessels. In essence, the blood flow to the nerves is limited, leaving the nerves without blood flow, and they get damaged or die as a result (a term known as ischemia). Symptoms of diabetic nerve damage include numbness, burning, and aching of the feet and lower extremities. When the nerve disease causes a complete loss of sensation in the feet, patients may not be aware of injuries to the feet, and fail to properly protect them. Shoes or other protection should be worn as much as possible. Seemingly minor skin injuries should be attended to promptly to avoid serious infections. Because of poor blood circulation, diabetic foot injuries may not heal. Sometimes, minor foot injuries can lead to serious infection, ulcers, and even ''gangrene'', necessitating surgical amputation of toes, feet, and other infected parts.''Diabetic nerve damage can affect the nerves that are important for penile erection, causing ''erectile dysfunction'' (''ED'', ''impotence''). ''Erectile dysfunction'' can also be caused by poor blood flow to the penis from diabetic blood vessel disease.''Diabetic neuropathy'' can also affect nerves to the stomach and ''intestines'', causing nausea, weight loss, ''diarrhea'', and other symptoms of ''gastroparesis'' (delayed emptying of food contents from the stomach into the intestines, due to ineffective contraction of the stomach muscles).''The ''pain'' of diabetic nerve damage may respond to traditional treatments with certain medications such as ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin''), ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin''), and ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol'') that are traditionally used in the treatment of ''seizure disorders''. ''Amitriptyline'' (''Elavil'', ''Endep'') and ''desipramine'' (Norpraminine) are medications that are traditionally used for ''depression''. While many of these medications are not indicated specifically for the treatment of diabetes related ''nerve pain'', they are used by physicians commonly.''The pain of diabetic nerve damage may also improve with better blood sugar control, though unfortunately blood glucose control and the course of neuropathy do not always go hand in hand. Newer medications for nerve pain include ''Pregabalin'' (''Lyrica'') and ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta'').' "
What can be done to slow the complications of diabetes?,"'Findings from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) have clearly shown that aggressive and intensive control of elevated levels of blood sugar in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes decreases the complications of nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and may reduce the occurrence and severity of large blood vessel diseases. Aggressive control with intensive therapy means achieving fasting glucose levels between 70-120 mg/dl; glucose levels of less than 160 mg/dl after meals; and a near normal hemoglobin A1c levels (see below).''Studies in type 1 patients have shown that in intensively treated patients, ''diabetic eye disease'' decreased by 76%, kidney disease decreased by 54%, and nerve disease decreased by 60%. More recently the EDIC trial has shown that type 1 diabetes is also associated with increased heart disease, similar to type 2 diabetes. However, the price for aggressive blood sugar control is a two to three fold increase in the incidence of abnormally low blood sugar levels (caused by the ''diabetes medications''). For this reason, tight control of diabetes to achieve glucose levels between 70 to120 mg/dl is not recommended for children under 13 years of age, patients with severe recurrent hypoglycemia, patients unaware of their hypoglycemia, and patients with far advanced diabetes complications. To achieve optimal glucose control without an undue risk of abnormally lowering blood sugar levels, patients with type 1 diabetes must monitor their blood glucose at least four times a day and administer insulin at least three times per day. In patients with type 2 diabetes, aggressive blood sugar control has similar beneficial effects on the eyes, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels.' "
What is the prognosis for a person with diabetes?,"'The prognosis of diabetes is related to the extent to which the condition is kept under control to prevent the development of the complications described in the preceding sections. Some of the more serious complications of diabetes such as ''kidney failure'' and ''cardiovascular disease'', can be life-threatening. Acute complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis can also be life-threatening. As mentioned above, aggressive control of blood sugar levels can prevent or delay the onset of complications, and many people with diabetes lead long and full lives.' "
What should I know about diabetes type 1 and type 2?,"'Diabetes'' Type 1 and Type 2 facts''How does diabetes make you feel?'   Diabetes is a chronic condition associated with abnormally high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Insulin produced by the pancreas lowers blood glucose. Absence or insufficient production of insulin, or an inability of the body to properly use insulin causes diabetes. The two types of diabetes are referred to as type 1 and type 2. Former names for these conditions were insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes, or juvenile onset and adult-onset diabetes. Some of the risk factors for getting diabetes include being overweight or obese, leading a sedentary lifestyle, a family history of diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), and low levels of the ""good"" cholesterol (HDL) and elevated levels of triglycerides in the blood. If you think you may have prediabetes or diabetes contact a health-care professional. Symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes includeincreased urine output,excessive thirst,weight loss,hunger,fatigue,skin problemsslow healing wounds,yeast infections, andtingling or numbness in the feet or toes. increased urine output, excessive thirst, weight loss, hunger, fatigue, skin problems slow healing wounds, yeast infections, and tingling or numbness in the feet or toes."
What is diabetes?,"'Diabetes mellitus'' is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by ''high blood sugar'' (glucose) levels that result from defects in insulin secretion, or its action, or both. Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes (as it will be in this article) was first identified as a disease associated with ""sweet urine,"" and excessive muscle loss in the ancient world. Elevated levels of blood glucose (''hyperglycemia'') lead to spillage of glucose into the urine, hence the term sweet urine.''Normally, blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin lowers the blood glucose level. When the blood glucose elevates (for example, after eating food), insulin is released from the pancreas to normalize the glucose level by promoting the uptake of glucose into body cells. In patients with diabetes, the absence of insufficient production of or lack of response to insulin causes hyperglycemia. Diabetes is a chronic medical condition, meaning that although it can be controlled, it lasts a lifetime.' "
How many people in the US have diabetes?," Diabetes affects approximately 30.3 million people (9.4% of the population) in the United States, while another estimated 84.1 million people have prediabetes and don't know it. An estimated 7.2 million people in the United States have diabetes and don't even know it. Over time, diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney failure, and nerve damage. These types of damage are the result of damage to small vessels, referred to as microvascular disease. Diabetes also is an important factor in accelerating the hardening and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis), leading to strokes, coronary heart disease, and other large blood vessel diseases. This is referred to as macrovascular disease. From an economic perspective, the total annual cost of diabetes in 2012 was estimated to be 245 billion dollars in the United States. This included 116 billion in direct medical costs (healthcare costs) for people with diabetes and another 69 billion in other costs due to disability, premature death, or work loss. Medical expenses for people with diabetes are over two times higher than those for people who do not have diabetes. Remember, these numbers reflect only the population in the United States. Globally, the statistics are staggering. Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of death in the United States listed on death certificates in recent years."
9 early signs and symptoms of diabetes,"   The early symptoms of untreated diabetes are related to elevated blood sugar levels, and loss of glucose in the urine. High amounts of glucose in the urine can cause increased urine output (frequent urination) and lead to dehydration. The dehydration also causes increased thirst and water consumption. A relative or absolute insulin deficiency eventually leads to weight loss. The weight loss of diabetes occurs despite an increase in appetite. Some untreated diabetes patients also complain of fatigue. Nausea and vomiting can also occur in patients with untreated diabetes. Frequent infections (such as infections of the bladder, skin, and vaginal areas) are more likely to occur in people with untreated or poorly-controlled diabetes. Fluctuations in blood glucose levels can lead to blurred vision. Extremely elevated glucose levels can lead to lethargy and coma."
How do I know if I have diabetes?," Many people are unaware that they have diabetes, especially in its early stages when symptoms may not be present. There is no definite way to know if you have diabetes without undergoing blood tests to determine your blood glucose levels (see section on Diagnosis of diabetes). See your doctor if you have symptoms of diabetes or if you are concerned about your diabetes risk."
What causes diabetes?,"""Insufficient production of insulin (either absolutely or relative to the body's needs), production of defective insulin (which is uncommon), or the inability of cells to use insulin properly and efficiently leads to hyperglycemia and diabetes.""'In ''type 2 diabetes'', there also is a steady decline of beta cells that adds to the process of elevated blood sugars. Essentially, if someone is resistant to insulin, the body can, to some degree, increase production of insulin and overcome the level of resistance. After time, if production decreases and insulin cannot be released as vigorously, hyperglycemia develops.''What is glucose?''Glucose is a simple sugar found in food. Glucose is an essential nutrient that provides energy for the proper functioning of the body cells. Carbohydrates are broken down in the small intestine and the glucose in digested food is then absorbed by the intestinal cells into the bloodstream, and is carried by the bloodstream to all the cells in the body where it is utilized. However, glucose cannot enter the cells alone and needs insulin to aid in its transport into the cells. Without insulin, the cells become starved of glucose energy despite the presence of abundant glucose in the bloodstream. In certain types of diabetes, the cells\' inability to utilize glucose gives rise to the ironic situation of ""starvation in the midst of plenty"". The abundant, unutilized glucose is wastefully excreted in the urine.''What is insulin?'""Insulin is a hormone that is produced by specialized cells (beta cells) of the pancreas. (The pancreas is a deep-seated organ in the abdomen located behind the stomach.) In addition to helping glucose enter the cells, insulin is also important in tightly regulating the level of glucose in the blood. After a meal, the blood glucose level rises. In response to the increased glucose level, the pancreas normally releases more insulin into the bloodstream to help glucose enter the cells and lower blood glucose levels after a meal. When the blood glucose levels are lowered, the insulin release from the pancreas is turned down. It is important to note that even in the fasting state there is a low steady release of insulin than fluctuates a bit and helps to maintain a steady blood sugar level during fasting. In normal individuals, such a regulatory system helps to keep blood glucose levels in a tightly controlled range. As outlined above, in patients with diabetes, the insulin is either absent, relatively insufficient for the body's needs, or not used properly by the body. All of these factors cause elevated levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia).""   This latter condition affects mostly the cells of muscle and fat tissues, and results in a condition known as insulin resistance. This is the primary problem in type 2 diabetes. The absolute lack of insulin, usually secondary to a destructive process affecting the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, is the main disorder in type 1 diabetes."
What are the risk factors for diabetes?,"'Risk factors for ''type 1 diabetes'' are not as well understood as those for type 2 diabetes. Family history is a known risk factor for ''type 1 diabetes''. Other risk factors can include having certain infections or diseases of the pancreas.''Risk factors for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes are many. The following can raise your risk of developing type 2 diabetes:' Being obese or overweight High blood pressure Elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of ""good"" cholesterol (HDL) Sedentary lifestyle Family history Increasing age Polycystic ovary syndrome Impaired glucose tolerance  Insulin resistance Gestational diabetes during a pregnancy Ethnic background: Hispanic/Latino Americans, African-Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Alaska natives are at greater risk."
What are the different types of diabetes?,"""There are two major types of diabetes, called type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes was also formerly called insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), or juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas undergoes an autoimmune attack by the body itself, and is rendered incapable of making insulin. Abnormal antibodies have been found in the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes. Antibodies are proteins in the blood that are part of the body's immune system. The patient with type 1 diabetes must rely on insulin medication for survival."" "
What is type 1 diabetes?,"""In autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly manufactures antibodies and inflammatory cells that are directed against and cause damage to patients' own body tissues. In persons with type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas, which are responsible for insulin production, are attacked by the misdirected immune system. It is believed that the tendency to develop abnormal antibodies in type 1 diabetes is, in part, genetically ""'inherited'', though the details are not fully understood.''Exposure to certain viral infections (''mumps'' and Coxsackie ''viruses'') or other environmental toxins may serve to trigger abnormal antibody responses that cause damage to the pancreas cells where insulin is made. Some of the antibodies seen in type 1 diabetes include anti-islet cell antibodies, anti-insulin antibodies and anti-glutamic decarboxylase antibodies. These antibodies can be detected in the majority of patients, and may help determine which individuals are at risk for developing type 1 diabetes.''At present, the American Diabetes Association does not recommend general screening of the population for type 1 diabetes, though screening of high risk individuals, such as those with a first degree relative (sibling or parent) with type 1 diabetes should be encouraged. Type 1 diabetes tends to occur in young, lean individuals, usually before 30 years of age; however, older patients do present with this form of diabetes on occasion. This subgroup is referred to as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). LADA is a slow, progressive form of type 1 diabetes. Of all the people with diabetes, only approximately 10% have type 1 diabetes and the remaining 90% have type 2 diabetes.' "
What is type 2 diabetes?,"""Type 2 diabetes was also previously referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), or adult-onset diabetes mellitus (AODM). In type 2 diabetes, patients can still produce insulin, but do so relatively inadequately for their body's needs, particularly in the face of insulin resistance as discussed above. In many cases this actually means the pancreas produces larger than normal quantities of insulin. A major feature of type 2 diabetes is a lack of sensitivity to insulin by the cells of the body (particularly fat and muscle cells).""'In addition to the problems with an increase in insulin resistance, the release of insulin by the pancreas may also be defective and suboptimal. In fact, there is a known steady decline in beta cell production of insulin in type 2 diabetes that contributes to worsening glucose control. (This is a major factor for many patients with type 2 diabetes who ultimately require insulin therapy.) Finally, the ''liver'' in these patients continues to produce glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis despite elevated glucose levels. The control of gluconeogenesis becomes compromised.''While it is said that type 2 diabetes occurs mostly in individuals over 30 years old and the incidence increases with age, an alarming number of patients with type 2 diabetes are barely in their teen years. Most of these cases are a direct result of poor eating habits, higher body weight, and lack of ''exercise''.''While there is a strong genetic component to developing this form of diabetes, there are other risk factors - the most significant of which is ''obesity''. There is a direct relationship between the degree of obesity and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and this holds true in children as well as adults. It is estimated that the chance to develop diabetes doubles for every 20% increase over desirable body weight.''Regarding age, data shows that for each decade after 40 years of age regardless of weight there is an increase in incidence of diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes in persons 65 years of age and older is around 25%. Type 2 diabetes is also more common in certain ethnic groups. Compared with a 7% prevalence in non-Hispanic Caucasians, the prevalence in Asian Americans is estimated to be 8.0%, in Hispanics 13%, in blacks around 12.3%, and in certain Native American communities 20% to 50%. Finally, diabetes occurs much more frequently in women with a prior history of diabetes that develops during pregnancy (''gestational diabetes'').' "
What are the other types of diabetes?,"'Diabetes can occur temporarily during pregnancy, and reports suggest that it occurs in 2% to 10% of all ''pregnancies''. Significant hormonal changes during pregnancy can lead to blood sugar elevation in genetically predisposed individuals. Blood sugar elevation during pregnancy is called gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes usually resolves once the baby is born. However, 35% to 60% of women with gestational diabetes will eventually develop type 2 diabetes over the next 10 to 20 years, especially in those who require insulin during pregnancy and those who remain overweight after their delivery. Women with gestational diabetes are usually asked to undergo an ''oral glucose tolerance test'' about six weeks after giving birth to determine if their diabetes has persisted beyond the pregnancy, or if any evidence (such as impaired glucose tolerance) is present that may be a clue to a risk for developing diabetes.''""Secondary"" diabetes refers to elevated blood sugar levels from another medical condition. Secondary diabetes may develop when the pancreatic tissue responsible for the production of insulin is destroyed by disease, such as ''chronic pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas by toxins like excessive ''alcohol''), ''trauma'', or surgical removal of the pancreas.'""Diabetes can also result from other hormonal disturbances, such as excessive growth hormone production (acromegaly) and Cushing's syndrome. In acromegaly, a ""'pituitary gland'' ''tumor'"" at the base of the brain causes excessive production of growth hormone, leading to hyperglycemia. In Cushing's syndrome, the adrenal glands produce an excess of cortisol, which promotes blood sugar elevation.""'Certain medications may worsen diabetes control, or ""unmask"" latent diabetes. This is seen most commonly when steroid medications (such as ''prednisone'') are taken and also with medications used in the treatment of ''HIV'' infection (''AIDS'').' "
What kind of doctor treats diabetes?,"'Endocrinology is the specialty of medicine that deals with hormone disturbances, and both endocrinologists and pediatric endocrinologists manage patients with diabetes. People with diabetes may also be treated by family medicine or internal medicine specialists. When complications arise, people with diabetes may be treated by other specialists, including neurologists, gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists, surgeons, cardiologists, or others.' "
How is diabetes diagnosed?,"'The  ''fasting blood glucose'"" (sugar) test is the preferred way to diagnose diabetes. It is easy to perform and convenient. After the person has fasted overnight (at least 8 hours), a single sample of blood is drawn and sent to the laboratory for analysis. This can also be done accurately in a doctor's office using a glucose meter.""'When fasting blood glucose stays above 100mg/dl, but in the range of 100-126mg/dl, this is known as impaired fasting glucose (IFG). While patients with IFG or prediabetes do not have the diagnosis of diabetes, this condition carries with it its own risks and concerns, and is addressed elsewhere.''Though not routinely used any longer, the oral ''glucose tolerance test'' (OGTT) is a gold standard for making the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It is still commonly used for diagnosing gestational diabetes and in conditions of pre-diabetes, such as polycystic ovary syndrome. With an oral glucose tolerance test, the person fasts overnight (at least eight but not more than 16 hours). Then first, the fasting plasma glucose is tested. After this test, the person receives an oral dose (75 grams) of glucose. There are several methods employed by obstetricians to do this test, but the one described here is standard. Usually, the glucose is in a sweet-tasting liquid that the person ''drinks''. Blood samples are taken at specific intervals to measure the blood glucose.''For the test to give reliable results:''The classic oral glucose tolerance test measures blood glucose levels five times over a period of three hours. Some physicians simply get a baseline blood sample followed by a sample two hours after drinking the glucose solution. In a person without diabetes, the glucose levels rise and then fall quickly. In someone with diabetes, glucose levels rise higher than normal and fail to come back down as fast.''People with glucose levels between normal and diabetic have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or insulin resistance. People with impaired glucose tolerance do not have diabetes, but are at high risk for progressing to diabetes. Each year, 1% to 5% of people whose test results show impaired glucose tolerance actually eventually develop diabetes. Weight loss and ''exercise'' may help people with impaired glucose tolerance return their glucose levels to normal. In addition, some physicians advocate the use of medications, such as ''metformin'' (''Glucophage''), to help prevent/delay the onset of overt diabetes.''Research has shown that impaired glucose tolerance itself may be a risk factor for the development of ''heart disease''. In the medical community, most physicians now understand that impaired glucose tolerance is not simply a precursor of diabetes, but is its own clinical disease entity that requires treatment and monitoring.''Glucose tolerance tests may lead to one of the following diagnoses:' Normal fasting plasma glucose levels are less than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Fasting plasma glucose levels of more than 126 mg/dl on two or more tests on different days indicate diabetes. A random blood glucose test can also be used to diagnose diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dl or higher indicates diabetes. The person must be in good health (not have any other illnesses, not even a cold). The person should be normally active (not lying down, for example, as an inpatient in a hospital), and The person should not be taking medicines that could affect the blood glucose. The morning of the test, the person should not smoke or drink coffee. Normal response: A person is said to have a normal response when the 2-hour glucose level is less than 140 mg/dl, and all values between 0 and 2 hours are less than 200 mg/dl. Impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes): A person is said to have impaired glucose tolerance when the fasting plasma glucose is less than 126 mg/dl and the 2-hour glucose level is between 140 and 199 mg/dl. Diabetes: A person has diabetes when two diagnostic tests done on different days show that the blood glucose level is high. Gestational diabetes:  A pregnant woman has gestational diabetes when she has any two of the following:, a fasting plasma glucose of 92 mg/dl or more, a 1-hour glucose level of 180 mg/dl or more, or a 2-hour glucose level of 153 mg/dl, or more."
Why is blood sugar checked at home?,"'Home blood sugar (glucose) testing is an important part of controlling blood sugar. One important goal of ''diabetes treatment'' is to keep the blood glucose levels near the normal range of 70 to 120 mg/dl before meals and under 140 mg/dl at two hours after eating. Blood glucose levels are usually tested before and after meals, and at bedtime. The blood sugar level is typically determined by pricking a fingertip with a lancing device and applying the blood to a glucose meter, which reads the value. There are many meters on the market, for example, Accu-Check Advantage, One Touch Ultra, Sure Step and Freestyle. Each meter has its own advantages and disadvantages (some use less blood, some have a larger digital readout, some take a shorter time to give you results, etc.). The test results are then used to help patients make adjustments in medications, diets, and physical activities.''There are some interesting developments in blood glucose monitoring including continuous glucose sensors. The new continuous glucose sensor systems involve an implantable cannula placed just under the skin in the abdomen or in the arm. This cannula allows for frequent sampling of blood glucose levels. Attached to this is a transmitter that sends the data to a pager-like device. This device has a visual screen that allows the wearer to see, not only the current glucose reading, but also the graphic trends. In some devices, the rate of change of blood sugar is also shown. There are alarms for low and high sugar levels. Certain models will alarm if the rate of change indicates the wearer is at risk for dropping or rising blood glucose too rapidly. One version is specifically designed to interface with their insulin pumps. In most cases the patient still must manually approve any insulin dose (the pump cannot blindly respond to the glucose information it receives, it can only give a calculated suggestion as to whether the wearer should give insulin, and if so, how much). However, in 2013 the US FDA approved the first artificial pancreas type device, meaning an implanted sensor and pump combination that stops insulin delivery when glucose levels reach a certain low point. All of these devices need to be correlated to fingersticks measurements for a few hours before they can function independently. The devices can then provide readings for 3 to 5 days.''Diabetes experts feel that these blood glucose monitoring devices give patients a significant amount of independence to manage their disease process; and they are a great tool for education as well. It is also important to remember that these devices can be used intermittently with fingerstick measurements. For example, a well-controlled patient with diabetes can rely on fingerstick glucose checks a few times a day and do well. If they become ill, if they decide to embark on a new exercise regimen, if they change their ''diet'"" and so on, they can use the sensor to supplement their fingerstick regimen, providing more information on how they are responding to new lifestyle changes or stressors. This kind of system takes us one step closer to closing the loop, and to the development of an artificial pancreas that senses insulin requirements based on glucose levels and the body's needs and releases insulin accordingly - the ultimate goal.""'Hemoglobin A1c'' (HBA1c)''To explain what ''hemoglobin'"" A1c is, think in simple terms. Sugar sticks, and when it's around for a long time, it's harder to get it off. In the body, sugar sticks too, particularly to proteins. The ""'red blood cells'"" that circulate in the body live for about three months before they die off. When sugar sticks to these hemoglobin proteins in these cells, it is known as glycosylated hemoglobin or hemoglobin A1c (HBA1c). Measurement of HBA1c gives us an idea of how much sugar is present in the bloodstream for the preceding three months. In most labs, the normal range is 4%-5.9 %. In poorly controlled diabetes, its 8.0% or above, and in well controlled patients it's less than 7.0% (optimal is <6.5%). The benefits of measuring A1c is that is gives a more reasonable and stable view of what's happening over the course of time (three months), and the value does not vary as much as ""'finger stick'' blood sugar measurements. There is a direct correlation between A1c levels and average blood sugar levels as follows.''While there are no guidelines to use A1c as a screening tool, it gives a physician a good idea that someone is diabetic if the value is elevated. Right now, it is used as a standard tool to determine blood sugar control in patients known to have diabetes.''The American Diabetes Association currently recommends an A1c goal of less than 7.0% with A1C goal for selected individuals of as close to normal as possible (<6%) without significant ''hypoglycemia''. Other Groups such as the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists feel that an A1c of <6.5% should be the goal.''Of interest, studies have shown that there is about a 35% decrease in relative risk for microvascular disease for every 1% reduction in A1c. The closer to normal the A1c, the lower the absolute risk for microvascular complications.''It should be mentioned here that there are a number of conditions in which an A1c value may not be accurate. For example, with significant ''anemia'', the red blood cell count is low, and thus the A1c is altered. This may also be the case in ''sickle cell disease'' and other hemoglobinopathies.'  "
What are the acute complications of diabetes?,"'In patients with type 2 diabetes, ''stress'', infection, and medications (such as ''corticosteroids'') can also lead to severely elevated blood sugar levels. Accompanied by dehydration, severe blood sugar elevation in patients with type 2 diabetes can lead to an increase in blood osmolality (hyperosmolar state). This condition can worsen and lead to ''coma'' (hyperosmolar coma). A hyperosmolar coma usually occurs in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. Like diabetic ''ketoacidosis'', a hyperosmolar coma is a medical emergency. Immediate treatment with intravenous fluid and insulin is important in reversing the hyperosmolar state. Unlike patients with type 1 diabetes, patients with type 2 diabetes do not generally develop ketoacidosis solely on the basis of their diabetes. Since in general, type 2 diabetes occurs in an older population, concomitant medical conditions are more likely to be present, and these patients may actually be sicker overall. The complication and death rates from hyperosmolar coma is thus higher than in diabetic ketoacidosis.''Hypoglycemia means abnormally low blood sugar (glucose). In patients with diabetes, the most common cause of low blood sugar is excessive use of insulin or other glucose-lowering medications, to lower the blood sugar level in diabetic patients in the presence of a delayed or absent meal. When low blood sugar levels occur because of too much insulin, it is called an insulin reaction. Sometimes, low blood sugar can be the result of an insufficient caloric intake or sudden excessive physical exertion.''Blood glucose is essential for the proper functioning of brain cells. Therefore, low blood sugar can lead to central nervous system symptoms such as:''The actual level of blood sugar at which these symptoms occur varies with each person, but usually it occurs when blood sugars are less than 50 mg/dl. Untreated, severely low blood sugar levels can lead to coma, ''seizures'', and, in the worst case scenario, irreversible brain death.''The treatment of low blood sugar consists of administering a quickly absorbed glucose source. These include glucose containing drinks, such as orange juice, soft drinks (not sugar-free), or glucose tablets in doses of 15-20 grams at a time (for example, the equivalent of half a glass of juice). Even cake frosting applied inside the cheeks can work in a pinch if patient cooperation is difficult. If the individual becomes unconscious, glucagon can be given by intramuscular injection.''Glucagon is a hormone that causes the release of glucose from the liver (for example, it promotes gluconeogenesis). Glucagon can be lifesaving and every patient with diabetes who has a history of hypoglycemia (particularly those on insulin) should have a glucagon kit. Families and friends of those with diabetes need to be taught how to administer glucagon, since obviously the patients will not be able to do it themselves in an emergency situation. Another lifesaving device that should be mentioned is very simple; a medic-alert bracelet should be worn by all patients with diabetes.''Insulin is vital to patients with type 1 diabetes - they cannot live without a source of exogenous insulin. Without insulin, patients with type 1 diabetes develop severely elevated blood sugar levels. This leads to increased urine glucose, which in turn leads to excessive loss of fluid and ''electrolytes'' in the urine. Lack of insulin also causes the inability to store fat and protein along with breakdown of existing fat and protein stores. This dysregulation, results in the process of ketosis and the release of ketones into the blood. Ketones turn the blood acidic, a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''abdominal pain''. Without prompt medical treatment, patients with diabetic ketoacidosis can rapidly go into ''shock'', coma, and even death may result.''Diabetic ketoacidosis can be caused by infections, ''stress'', or trauma, all of which may increase insulin requirements. In addition, missing doses of insulin is also an obvious risk factor for developing diabetic ketoacidosis. Urgent treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis involves the intravenous administration of fluid, electrolytes, and insulin, usually in a hospital intensive care unit. Dehydration can be very severe, and it is not unusual to need to replace 6-7 liters of fluid when a person presents in diabetic ketoacidosis. Antibiotics are given for infections. With treatment, abnormal blood sugar levels, ketone production, acidosis, and dehydration can be reversed rapidly, and patients can recover remarkably well.'

What are the chronic complications of diabetes?,"'These ''diabetes complications'' are related to blood vessel diseases and are generally classified into small vessel disease, such as those involving the eyes, kidneys and nerves (microvascular disease), and large vessel disease involving the ''heart'' and blood vessels (macrovascular disease). Diabetes accelerates ''hardening of the arteries'' (atherosclerosis) of the larger blood vessels, leading to coronary ''heart disease'' (''angina'' or ''heart attack''), strokes, and ''pain'' in the lower extremities because of lack of blood supply (''claudication'').''The major eye complication of diabetes is called ''diabetic retinopathy''. ''Diabetic retinopathy'' occurs in patients who have had diabetes for at least five years. Diseased small blood vessels in the back of the eye cause the leakage of protein and blood in the retina. Disease in these blood vessels also causes the formation of small aneurysms (microaneurysms), and new but brittle blood vessels (neovascularization). Spontaneous bleeding from the new and brittle blood vessels can lead to retinal scarring and ''retinal detachment'', thus impairing vision.''To treat diabetic retinopathy, a laser is used to destroy and prevent the recurrence of the development of these small aneurysms and brittle blood vessels. Approximately 50% of patients with diabetes will develop some degree of diabetic retinopathy after 10 years of diabetes, and 80% retinopathy after 15 years of the disease. Poor control of blood sugar and ''blood pressure'' further aggravates eye disease in diabetes.''Cataracts'' and ''glaucoma'' are also more common among diabetics. It is also important to note that since the ''lens'' of the eye lets water through, if blood sugar concentrations vary a lot, the lens of the eye will shrink and swell with fluid accordingly. As a result, blurry vision is very common in poorly controlled diabetes. Patients are usually discouraged from getting a new eyeglass prescription until their blood sugar is controlled. This allows for a more accurate assessment of what kind of glasses prescription is required.''Kidney damage from diabetes is called ''diabetic nephropathy''. The onset of ''kidney disease'' and its progression is extremely variable. Initially, diseased small blood vessels in the kidneys cause the leakage of ''protein in the urine''. Later on, the kidneys lose their ability to cleanse and filter blood. The accumulation of toxic waste products in the blood leads to the need for ''dialysis''. Dialysis involves using a machine that serves the function of the kidney by filtering and cleaning the blood. In patients who do not want to undergo chronic dialysis, kidney transplantation can be considered.''The progression of nephropathy in patients can be significantly slowed by controlling ''high blood pressure'', and by aggressively treating high blood sugar levels. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (''ACE inhibitors'') or angiotensin receptor blockers (''ARBs'') used in treating ''high blood pressure'' may also benefit kidney disease in patients with diabetes.''Nerve damage from diabetes is called ''diabetic neuropathy'' and is also caused by disease of small blood vessels. In essence, the blood flow to the nerves is limited, leaving the nerves without blood flow, and they get damaged or die as a result (a term known as ischemia). Symptoms of diabetic nerve damage include numbness, burning, and aching of the feet and lower extremities. When the nerve disease causes a complete loss of sensation in the feet, patients may not be aware of injuries to the feet, and fail to properly protect them. Shoes or other protection should be worn as much as possible. Seemingly minor skin injuries should be attended to promptly to avoid serious infections. Because of poor blood circulation, diabetic foot injuries may not heal. Sometimes, minor foot injuries can lead to serious infection, ulcers, and even ''gangrene'', necessitating surgical amputation of toes, feet, and other infected parts.''Diabetic nerve damage can affect the nerves that are important for penile erection, causing ''erectile dysfunction'' (''ED'', ''impotence''). ''Erectile dysfunction'' can also be caused by poor blood flow to the penis from diabetic blood vessel disease.''Diabetic neuropathy'' can also affect nerves to the stomach and ''intestines'', causing nausea, weight loss, ''diarrhea'', and other symptoms of ''gastroparesis'' (delayed emptying of food contents from the stomach into the intestines, due to ineffective contraction of the stomach muscles).''The ''pain'' of diabetic nerve damage may respond to traditional treatments with certain medications such as ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin''), ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin''), and ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol'') that are traditionally used in the treatment of ''seizure disorders''. ''Amitriptyline'' (''Elavil'', ''Endep'') and ''desipramine'' (Norpraminine) are medications that are traditionally used for ''depression''. While many of these medications are not indicated specifically for the treatment of diabetes related ''nerve pain'', they are used by physicians commonly.''The pain of diabetic nerve damage may also improve with better blood sugar control, though unfortunately blood glucose control and the course of neuropathy do not always go hand in hand. Newer medications for nerve pain include ''Pregabalin'' (''Lyrica'') and ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta'').' "
What can be done to slow the complications of diabetes?,"'Findings from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) have clearly shown that aggressive and intensive control of elevated levels of blood sugar in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes decreases the complications of nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and may reduce the occurrence and severity of large blood vessel diseases. Aggressive control with intensive therapy means achieving fasting glucose levels between 70-120 mg/dl; glucose levels of less than 160 mg/dl after meals; and a near normal hemoglobin A1c levels (see below).''Studies in type 1 patients have shown that in intensively treated patients, ''diabetic eye disease'' decreased by 76%, kidney disease decreased by 54%, and nerve disease decreased by 60%. More recently the EDIC trial has shown that type 1 diabetes is also associated with increased heart disease, similar to type 2 diabetes. However, the price for aggressive blood sugar control is a two to three fold increase in the incidence of abnormally low blood sugar levels (caused by the ''diabetes medications''). For this reason, tight control of diabetes to achieve glucose levels between 70 to120 mg/dl is not recommended for children under 13 years of age, patients with severe recurrent hypoglycemia, patients unaware of their hypoglycemia, and patients with far advanced diabetes complications. To achieve optimal glucose control without an undue risk of abnormally lowering blood sugar levels, patients with type 1 diabetes must monitor their blood glucose at least four times a day and administer insulin at least three times per day. In patients with type 2 diabetes, aggressive blood sugar control has similar beneficial effects on the eyes, kidneys, nerves and blood vessels.' "
What is the prognosis for a person with diabetes?,"'The prognosis of diabetes is related to the extent to which the condition is kept under control to prevent the development of the complications described in the preceding sections. Some of the more serious complications of diabetes such as ''kidney failure'' and ''cardiovascular disease'', can be life-threatening. Acute complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis can also be life-threatening. As mentioned above, aggressive control of blood sugar levels can prevent or delay the onset of complications, and many people with diabetes lead long and full lives.' "
What is prediabetes?,'Prediabetes is the term used to describe elevated blood sugar (glucose) that has not yet reached the threshold of a ''type 2 diabetes'' diagnosis. Consider pre-''diabetes'' a warning sign that it is time to take your health more seriously.' 
What is the difference between prediabetes and type 2 diabetes?,"'Without reversing prediabetes, blood sugar continues to rise and signs and ''symptoms of diabetes'' may develop. The most common symptoms and early signs are ''thirst'' and excess urination. Sometimes people will notice unexplained ''weight loss''. Later signs of ''type 2 diabetes'' are' Prediabetes occurs when there is too much sugar (glucose) in the blood. It is an early warning sign that the body has more sugar in the blood then it can use. Type 2 diabetes is a condition that occurs slowly over time. The pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to keep up with the increased need to move sugar into the cells for energy. Medication and lifestyle changes are necessary to manage blood sugar levels and avoid diabetes complications. 
Type 1 diabetes is different, and results from auto-immune attacks on the pancreas. Fatigue Blurry vision Slow healing wounds or bruises Thirst Excess urination Unusual smell to the 
urine"
What are the signs and symptoms of prediabetes?,"'Unfortunately, there really are no symptoms or signs of prediabetes. It almost always is diagnosed by chance during a medical screening or routine bloodwork. This is why it is important to get screened, especially if you are ''overweight'' or have family members with ''diabetes'' or pre-''diabetes''. However, the most common sign associated with prediabetes is being overweight.''It is common for a person with prediabetes to only have slightly elevated blood sugar levels, but the body continues to require increased insulin to maintain it. Hyperinsulinemia or high insulin, has signs and symptoms of:''Occasionally, people may notice they are thirstier than normal or are urinating more frequently.'  Sleepiness (after a meal) Lethargy Weight gain around the abdomen"
"What causes prediabetes, and what are the risk factors for prediabetes?","""Pre-diabetes is a warning sign that metabolism is getting out of balance. Humans are designed to be physically active hunters and gatherers who move a lot and eat only occasionally. This isn't what most of us do. Essentially, the underlying cause of prediabetes is that there is more fuel (glucose) available than can be used up. This can be because of excess intake of dietary carbs and sugars, because of ""'insulin resistance'', or because the ''liver'' is making too much glucose. The easiest causes of prediabetes to manage are insulin resistance and excess dietary intake. For many people with prediabetes, it can be reversed with ''exercise'' in combination with a eating a low-carb ''diet'' (low-''glycemic index'' diet).''Some of the risk factors for prediabetes include' Family history (having a family member with diabetes or prediabetes) Ethnic heritage (Hispanics, Latinos, and African-Americans are at highest risk) Having had gestational diabetes, Having PCOS or polycystic ovarian syndrome, Being overweight or obese, Smoking, Having heart disease, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol Eating too much processed food, sugar, or soda Not being physically active every day Being under high stress and not releasing it in healthy ways like exercise"
Is there a test to diagnose prediabetes (HbA1c and prediabetes chart)?,"'There are three blood tests that can diagnose prediabetes and ''type 2 diabetes''.''Prediabetes glucose levels are shown here in a chart of normal, prediabetes, and diabetes lab test numbers so you can make comparisons.' Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measures the average blood sugar (glucose) over the last 3 months. It is a measure of how much sugar is attached to your red blood cells. A pre-diabetes level is 5.7% and 6.4%. An HbA1c > 6.5% is considered a diabetes glucose level. Fasting blood sugar or serum glucose is a measure of your blood sugar first thing in the morning before you have eaten anything. Prediabetes also can be identified with serum glucose, or blood sugar level. A fasting blood 
sugar test of 100-125 mg/dl indicates prediabetes. Prediabetes and diabetes also can be diagnosed with an oral glucose tolerance test. This test measures how high blood sugar levels get at fixed time intervals after consuming a high sugar content beverage. This test is most commonly used to diagnose diabetes related to pregnancy (gestational diabetes)."
Can prediabetes be reversed?,"'Prediabetes can be reversed with lifestyle changes. This includes being more physically active and following a healthy diet plan such as a low glycemic index diet, rich in quality, real foods. ''Quitting smoking'',''stress management'', and keeping ''alcohol'' intake moderate all help too. If lifestyle is not changed, prediabetes usually progresses to diabetes.''When you are working to reverse prediabetes, your health-care professional will advise you on how often you should have your blood tests checked – usually every 3 months.''Having your own personal home glucose monitor (''finger stick'' test) gets you involved in managing your prediabetes, and also can help you track your progress. Write down the numbers and what was consumed to learn how you respond to different meals. This is a great way to test different prediabetes meal plans to find out what foods cause your blood sugar levels to go up the least, and the most!''Do the following to track your meals and foods.' Check your blood sugar and write it down. Enjoy your meal and write down what you ate and the portion sizes. In two hours, check your blood sugar and write it down. Did that meal treat your body well? How much did your blood sugar go up? How did you feel? Keep a log of these readings to discuss them with your health-care professional or nutritionist to problem-solve ways to make better diet choices. This will help you find foods to eat and foods to avoid for your personal situation."
What is the treatment for prediabetes?,"'Prediabetes is best treated with a proactive, renewed commitment to getting healthier, and making healthier choices every day. It can, and usually is, treated with diet and exercise alone. However, some people with prediabetes are treated with a medication called ''metformin'' (''Glucophage'', ''Glucophage'' XR, ''Glumetza'', ''Fortamet'', ''Riomet''). Research published in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' showed that lifestyle changes reduced diabetes incidence by 58% compared to ''metformin'', which reduced the incidence by only 31%.''1''If you have been diagnosed with prediabetes, discuss a treatment plan with your health-care professional.' "
Is there prediabetes diet?,"'The best foods for prediabetes are''The foods to eat for prediabetes are real foods in their natural or whole form. There needs to be a balance of fat, protein, and carbohydrate. Drinking lots of water or unsweetened tea also is important.''And easy way to identify the most important foods to avoid is to avoid any food that is white. This includes''Cauliflower is white, but it is a good food for prediabetes because it is a whole, real vegetable.''It also is best to avoid highly processed foods (like foods that come in boxes or packages already prepared). These foods are high in calories, carbs, chemicals, and low in nutrients and ''vitamins''. Other foods to avoid include:''The take home message is to pay close attention to the quality of all foods - fats, proteins, and carbohydrates – and choose less processed ones.'  healthy proteins and fats, lots of vegetables, some fruits, and some low glycemic index carbohydrates like quinoa, oatmeal, and brown rice. Sugar (and anything made with sugar) White flour (and anything made with flour) White bread White rice White pasta White potato, etc. Fried foods Fatty meat such as prime rib, burgers, bacon, and fatty cuts of pork, sausages, greasy burgers, 
hydrogenated fats. Blackened or burned foods (these cause inflammation) Snack foods like pretzels, chips, or cookies Many “energy bars” (compare nutrition labels - a bar that is friendly for prediabetes will have less than 5 grams of sugars and at least 2 grams of fiber) Meals without any vegetables Sodas, sweetened tea, fruit juice, juice-like sweetened beverages"
What about a low carb diet for prediabetes?,"'A low-carb diet is a great option for prediabetes because it will improve blood sugar, help you ''lose weight'', and help you feel more energetic. Carbohydrates are digested into glucose very easily. A person with prediabetes already has too much sugar in the blood so you don’t want to add any more.''To feel satisfied on a low carb diet you have to eat healthy amounts of protein and fat. Many people continue to try to follow a low-fat or fat-free diet while also trying to make low carb choices, and understandably, feel hungry and frustrated because there is nothing tasty to eat. Recent research published in the ''British Medical Journal'' debunked the low fat hypothesis (that people on a low fat diet have a lower risk of developing prediabetes).''2'' People actually ''are not at a lower risk'' of prediabetes.''The easiest way to choose quality carbohydrates by following a '' low glycemic index diet''. With a low glycemic index diet you balance the carbohydrate/sugar content of a meal with enough ''fiber'', fat, and protein so that the meal is digested and absorbed slowly. This gradually releases glucose into the bloodstream, and thus the body does not require a large amount of insulin. It also provides the body with good, steady energy over many hours.' "
What are examples of good food choices for a prediabetes diet?,"'Choosing quality fats and proteins means choosing real food rather than processed versions. Believe it or not, a serving of organic full-fat Greek yogurt with real raspberries will be much more satisfying, and better for your blood sugar and weight, than the fat-free fruity version.''Good protein choices include:''Organic and grass fed choices are important because what an animal eats changes the ''nutrition'' of the meat. Non-organic and factory-fed animal meats increase inflammation. In prediabetes, this means increased risk for ''heart disease'' and complications.''Make at least some of your meals ''vegetarian'' because plant-based fats are associated with lower oxidized LDL and less inflammation. Good fat choices include''Check labels because hydrogenated fats are often are used in packaged bakery products.' Organic poultry (chicken or turkey) Grass-fed red meat (beef or buffalo) Organic lean pork Wild fish and seafood Whole eggs Plant-based proteins such asbeanslentilsnutsseedstofupeasprotein powders for smoothies beans lentils nuts seeds tofu peas protein powders for smoothies Avocado Olive oil Coconut oil and coconut milk Organic full-fat dairy products Wild, cold water fish Grass-fed red meat Dark meat from pastured poultry"
What about exercise and prediabetes?,"'All exercise helps reverse prediabetes by using up sugar in the bloodstream and improving insulin sensitivity. An exercise plan should focus on two things:''Increasing muscle strength makes the cells of the muscle ""hungrier (more insulin sensitive), and that equals a healthier metabolism. You can build muscle by using weights, your own body weight, or resistance bands. If you choose weight training start slowly, and ask for help using the equipment safely and properly. Begin with low weights, and gradually work up to heavier weights. Lifting one round of heavy weights for only 6-8 repetitions has more benefit than one round of light weights for 10 or more repetitions. If you can do more than 10 repetitions, add more weight.''This plan also is great if you are in a hurry. You can complete a full workout in just 20 minutes twice a week. Work up to this gradually to avoid injury.''If you like cardiovascular exercise, focus on short bursts of high intensity activity. Research studies show that few people ''lose weight'"" by spending an hour on a treadmill or elliptical machine. Lifting heavy weights, and short sprints that make you breathless helps you lose weight best. For most people, this is less than 90 seconds, after which, you should walk until you catch your breath and do it again! You'll be done in 20 minutes.""'And, as always check with your health-care professional before starting any exercise program and get help using equipment properly to avoid injury.' Be physically active every day. This could be a walk after dinner, doing yard work or gardening, playing with the kids, swimming, biking, dancing, etc. Tracking the number of steps you take each day with a smartphone or fitness tracker can be very helpful. Focus on building more muscle a few times a week. "
What medications or supplements treat prediabetes?,"'Metformin is the only medication approved by the FDA to treat prediabetes. It works by stopping the ''liver'"" from producing excess glucose. For some people, metformin also helps them lose weight. It can be an option for people who aren't ready or able to make lifestyle changes right away. Metformin also is a medication that can be discontinued as soon as blood sugar levels are at goal, and healthy lifestyle habits have become routine.""'Some dietary ''supplements'' have good evidence of helping reverse prediabetes. For example, most people with prediabetes are deficient in ''vitamin D'' and magnesium. Both of these are necessary to keep cells properly sensitive to insulin. A health-care professional can order a blood test to check and see if your deficient in these and other nutrients, for example, chromium, biotin, and N-acetyl cysteine. These also are nutrients that have research supporting their role in improving insulin sensitivity.''3'' Check with a health-care professional before taking ''supplements''. You may need to find one with this specialized knowledge such as a naturopathic doctor, nutritionist, or integrative medicine doctor.'  "
What kind of doctor treats prediabetes?,"'Prediabetes is typically diagnosed and managed by your primary care practitioner, including internists and family medicine specialists, or pediatricians in the case of children or adolescents. Other specialists who may be consulted include physicians who specialize in endocrine glands and hormones including ''diabetes management'' (Endocrinologists). A nutritionist can be consulted to help you review your diet and suggest dietary and lifestyle changes. A personal trainer can be helpful if you are having a hard time putting together an exercise plan for yourself. There are a lot of self-care resources too. Eating healthier, exercising, and losing weight are ways to improve your health, and are key to prediabetes treatment.' "
Can prediabetes be prevented?,"'Absolutely! The best way to prevent prediabetes are to''If you had ''gestational diabetes'', you may want to pay special attention to adopting the habits discussed in this article.''Most importantly, for people with prediabetes, diabetes can be prevented by taking action now.' stay active, eat a healthy low glycemic index diet, and handle stress in healthy ways."
What is the prognosis for a person with prediabetes?,"""Unfortunately, most Americans with prediabetes don't make healthy changes or aren't empowered to take control of their health. Because of this, most people with prediabetes do progress to diabetes. But the good news is, and what research proves, is that with physical activity and healthier foods 58% of new cases of diabetes can be prevented."" "
What is type 2 diabetes? What causes diabetes?,"'There are two major forms of diabetes -- type 1 and type 2. This article focuses specifically on the prevention of type 2 diabetes since there is no know way to prevent ''type 1 diabetes''. This form of diabetes is virtually a pandemic in the United States. This information reviews the risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes and reviews key points regarding prediction of those at risk for type 2 diabetes. It also is a review of what they can do about it.''While diabetes is characterized by ''high blood sugar'' values, type 2 diabetes is also associated with a condition known as ''insulin resistance''. Even though there is an element of impaired ''insulin'"" secretion from the beta cells of the pancreas, especially when toxic levels of glucose occur (when blood sugars are constantly very high), the major defect in type 2 diabetes is the body's inability to respond properly to insulin.""'Eventually, even though the pancreas is working at its best to produce more and more insulin, the body tissues (for example, muscle and fat cells) do not respond and become insensitive to the insulin. At this point, overt diabetes occurs, as the body is no longer able to effectively use its insulin to maintain normal blood ''sugar'' levels. Over time, these high levels of sugar result in the complications we see all too often in patients with diabetes.' "
What are symptoms of prediabetes?,"'In general, prediabetes is not associated with any specific symptoms. However, there may be indicators of problems in blood sugar metabolism that can be seen years before the development of overt diabetes. Health care professionals in the field of endocrinology are now routinely looking at these indicators in patients who are at high risk for developing diabetes.''There is an association between the lengthening of the ''menstrual cycle'' and the risk for developing diabetes, particularly in ''obese'' women. In a national study of nurses, those who had a cycle length of greater than 40 days were twice as likely to develop diabetes then those who cycled every 26 to 31 days. The association is thought to be related to ''polycystic ovary syndrome'' (''PCOS''), which also is known to be associated with insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may be a precursor for type 2 diabetes.''By definition, diabetes is associated with a fasting blood sugar of greater than 126 mg/dl. There is another group that has been identified and referred to as having impaired fasting glucose or prediabetes. These people have a fasting blood sugar value of between 110-125mg/dl. The main concern with this group is that they have an increased potential to develop type 2 diabetes when compared to the normal population. The actual percent increase varies depending on ethnicity, weight, etc.; but it is significantly higher, regardless of absolute numbers. In addition, people with impaired fasting glucose also are at increased risk for ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''.''The role of inflammation\xa0in disease development is an area of extreme interest. For example, we have begun to understand the importance of inflammation and ''heart disease''. We now know that inflammation may play an important role in the development of diabetes as well. An inflammation marker known as ''C-reactive protein'' (CRP) has been shown to be increased in women at risk for developing the ''metabolic syndrome'', and in both men and women at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Recent studies have shown shifts in the blood levels of a number of markers for inflammation during the progression from no disease, to prediabetes, and then to full-blown diabetes. This research highlights the importance of inflammation as part of the mechanism of diabetes development.''Other risks for the development of diabetes include endothelial dysfunction (abnormal response of the inner lining of blood vessels) and retinal artery narrowing (narrowing of the tiny blood vessels in the back of the eye).'  "
Can type 2 diabetes be prevented naturally?,"'One of the most important factors in the development of diabetes is genetics (over which we have no control). However, there are things in our environment and lifestyle we can control to help prevent diabetes naturally or lower our personal risk of developing diabetes, including exercise and weight loss.''When adjusted for family history, the ''benefits of exercise'' can be evaluated based on previous studies. Of note, for every 500 kcal burned weekly through exercise, there is a 6% decrease in relative risk for the development of diabetes. This data is from a study done in men who were followed over a period of 10 years. The study also notes a greater benefit in men who were heavier at baseline. There have been similar reports on the effects of exercise in women.''Exercise is thought to be a major determinant of insulin sensitivity in muscle tissue. By increasing exercise, the body uses insulin more efficiently, for up to 70 hours after the exercise period has occurred. Thus, exercising three to four times per week would be beneficial in most people.''The same benefits appear when looking specifically at people with impaired prediabetes (glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose). When diet and exercise are used as tools in this population over a 6-year study and compared to a control group, glucose tolerance improves by about 76% compared to deterioration in 67% of the control group. The exercise group also had a lesser rate of progression to type 2 diabetes.''Much of the benefit of exercise occurs independent of weight loss. However, when combined with weight loss, the benefits increase substantially.''In people at risk for diabetes, weight loss can improve insulin sensitivity as well as delay, and even prevent progression to type 2 diabetes. In patients with overt diabetes, weight loss can play a tremendous role in improving blood sugar control.''Two large studies -- one in Finland and the other in the U.S. (the Diabetes Prevention Program [DPP]) -- have shown the benefit of weight loss in diabetes prevention. In the Finnish study, more than 500 men and women with ''impaired glucose tolerance'' were assigned to a control group or an exercise/weight loss group. By the end of the study, the weight loss group had lost about 8 pounds, and the control group about 2 pounds. The weight loss group had significantly less participants develop diabetes than the control group.''The DPP study showed a similar result. In this study, there was also a group taking metformin (Glucophage) as a preventive measure. At the end of the study, the lifestyle group actually did better at prevention of diabetes than those taking metformin. In fact, the study was stopped early, because the benefit of weight loss (the weight loss group lost about 15 pounds on average and kept it off) was so dramatic.''Smoking'"" 16 to 20 cigarettes a day or more can increase a person's risk of developing diabetes to more than three times that of nonsmokers. The exact reason for this isn't well understood. It may be that ""'smoking'' directly decreases the body\'s ability to utilize insulin. Moreover, it has been observed that after smoking, blood sugar levels increase. Finally, there is also an association between smoking and body fat distribution; smoking tends to encourage the ""apple"" shape, which is a risk factor for diabetes.''A study of over 83,000 women consuming nuts (and peanut butter) seemed to show some protective effect against the development of diabetes. Women who have more than five 1-ounce servings of nuts a week lowered their risk of developing diabetes compared to women who consumed no nuts at all.' "
What type of diet helps prevent diabetes?,"'Diet becomes a critical issue when dealing with disease processes. When exploring dietary factors as a contributor to disease processes, one must take a number of things into account, for example, is it the specific food itself or the ''weight gain'' associated with its consumption that causes the risk? Is it the food, or the age/lifestyle of those consuming it that causes the risk? While cinnamon, coffee, and ''fenugreek'' seeds are among the many food products that some feel are associated with development/prevention of diabetes, none of these claims have truly been fully scientifically evaluated.''Rather than following a specific diabetes prevention diet, the greatest impact in prevention has occurred with weight reduction. Consequently, there is no single recommended diabetes prevention diet. The American Diabetes Association recommends goals of modest weight loss (5%-10% of body weight) and moderate exercise as primary interventions for preventing type 2 diabetes.''In a study of over 42,000 men, diets high in red meat, processed meat, high-fat dairy products, and sweets were associated with an increased risk of diabetes by almost two times that of those eating a ""healthy"" diet without high levels of these foods. Again, this is independent of weight gain and other factors mentioned previously.''The data on dairy products seems to vary. In a study of over 289,000 health professionals, Harvard researchers showed that consumption of yogurt, in contrast to other dairy products, was associated with a reduced risk for diabetes. In a pooled analysis of 17 studies about dairy products and diabetes risk, those who consumed more dairy products had a lower risk than those who consumed few dairy products. A Swedish study found that high-fat dairy products, but not low-fat dairy products, lowered the risk for type 2 diabetes.''Sugar consumption alone has not been associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. Weight gain is associated with sugar consumption. However, after adjusting for weight gain and other variables, there appears to be a relationship between drinking sugar-laden ''beverages'' and the development of type 2 diabetes. Women who drink one or more of these ''drinks'' a day have almost twice the risk of developing diabetes than women who drink one a month or less.'  "
What are the risk factors for developing diabetes?,"'The risk factors for developing diabetes actually vary depending on where a person lives. This is in part due to the environment the person lives in, and in part due to the genetic ''makeup'' of the family. In the United States, it is estimated that one in three males and two out of every five females born in the year 2000 will develop diabetes (the lifetime risk). ''It has also been calculated that for those diagnosed with diabetes before the age of 40, the average life expectancy is reduced by 12 years for men\xa0and 19 years for women. ''The risk for developing diabetes increases in certain cases such as the following.'  Genetics: People with a close relative with type 2 diabetes are at higher risk. Ethnic background:  For example, the actual prevalence of diabetes in the Caucasian population of the U.S. is about 7.1%, while in the African American population, it increases to about 12.6%. Approximately 8.4% of Asian Americans and 11.6% of Hispanic Americans are affected. In a well-studied group of Native Americans, the Pima Indians, the prevalence increases to almost 35%. Birth weight: There is a relationship between birth weight and developing diabetes, and it's the opposite of what one might intuitively think. The lower the birth weight, the higher the risk of type 2 diabetes. At the other end of the spectrum, a very high birth weight (over 8.8 pounds or 4 kg) also is associated with an increased risk. Additionally, mothers of infants who had a higher birth weight (over 9 pounds) are at increased risk for developing diabetes. Metabolic syndrome: People who have the metabolic syndrome are at especially high risk for developing diabetes. Obesity: Obesity is probably the most impressive risk factor and in most situations the most controllable. This is in part due to the fact that obesity increases the body's resistance to insulin. Studies have shown that reversal of obesity through weight reduction improves insulin sensitivity and regulation of blood sugar. However, the distribution of fat is important. The classic ""pear"" shaped person (smaller waist than hips) has a lower risk of developing diabetes than the ""apple"" shaped person (larger around the waist). The exact reason for this difference is unknown, but it is thought to have something to do with the metabolic activity of the fat tissue in different areas of the body. Gestational diabetes: Women who have gestational diabetes during pregnancy have a greater risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life."
Is gestational diabetes a risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life?,"'The simple answer is yes. The risk for type 2 diabetes is higher in women who have had gestational diabetes (diabetes of pregnancy). In general, type 2 diabetes will occur in about 40% of women with gestational diabetes over the following 10 years. This number increases to the 50% range in obese women.''There are efforts underway to see if treating women with gestational diabetes (using lifestyle, and medications such as thiazolidinediones) can change the course of development of type 2 diabetes. The results appear promising, and further work is being done to identify who will potentially respond to treatment.' "
What treatment medications help prevent type 2 diabetes?,"  As described previously, metformin (Glucophage) has been shown in the DPP trial to prevent the development of diabetes in some people with impaired glucose tolerance. While not quite as effective as intensive lifestyle change, metformin decreased the rate of progression from 29% in the placebo group to 22%. The American Diabetes Association has recommended metformin for the prevention of diabetes in very high-risk individuals.High-risk individuals are those under 60 years of age or who are obese, or women with a history of gestational diabetes who have impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or hemoglobin A1C levels of 5.7% to 6.4%, in whom lifestyle interventions fail to improve control of glucose levels. High-risk individuals are those under 60 years of age or who are obese, or women with a history of gestational diabetes who have impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or hemoglobin A1C levels of 5.7% to 6.4%, in whom lifestyle interventions fail to improve control of glucose levels. Acarbose (Precose), a drug designed to reduce small intestinal absorption of carbohydrates has been used with some success as well and is licensed for diabetes prevention in some countries. The STOP NIDDM trial showed that in about 1,400 patients with impaired glucose tolerance, acarbose significantly reduced progression to diabetes compared to placebo. However, the occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects have limited the use of this drug for some people."
What is diabetes? What are the types of diabetes?,"'Diabetes'' is a metabolic disorder that occurs when your blood ''sugar'' (glucose), is too high (''hyperglycemia''). Glucose is what the body uses for energy, and the pancreas produces a hormone called ''insulin'' that helps convert the glucose from the food you eat into energy. When the body either does not produce enough ''insulin'', does not produce any at all, or your body becomes resistant to the insulin, the glucose does not reach your cells to be used for energy. This results in the health condition termed ''diabetes''.''There are two main types of ''diabetes'', type 1 and type 2.'   Type 1 diabetes, formerly called juvenile diabetes, because it usually is diagnosed during childhood. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which the body does not produce insulin because the body’s immune system attacks insulin-producing cells from the pancreas called beta cells. Type 1 diabetes is treated by using insulin. Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which cells cannot use blood sugar (glucose) efficiently for energy. This occurs when blood sugar levels get too high over time, and the cells become insensitive or resistant to insulin (termed insulin resistance). There are multiple medications used to treat type 2 diabetes."
What warning signs and symptoms of diabetes are the same in men and women?,"'There are ''diabetes'' warning signs and symptoms that both women and men have in common, for example:' Excessive thirst and hunger Frequent urination (from urinary tract infections or kidney problems) Weight loss or gain Fatigue Irritability Blurred vision Slow-healing wounds Nausea Skin infections Darkening of skin in areas of body creases (acanthosis nigricans) Breath odor that is fruity, sweet, or an acetone odor Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet"
What is prediabetes (pre-diabetes)?,"'Prediabetes'' is a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but a person does not yet have ''diabetes''. ''Prediabetes'' and high blood glucose levels are a risk factor for developing diabetes, ''heart disease'', and other health problems. Other warning signs prediabetes may include increased urination, feeling you need to urinate more often, and/or increased ''thirst''.'  "
What warning signs and symptoms of diabetes are unique to men?,"'Signs and ''symptoms of diabetes'' unique to men include:'   Erectile dysfunction (ED, impotence) Retrograde ejaculation Low testosterone (low-T) Decreased sex drive (decreased libido) and sexual dysfunction"
What are risk factors for diabetes in men?,"'Gender is a risk factor for diabetes, and men are at higher risk for developing ''type 2 diabetes'' than women.''Other risk factors for developing diabetes for both men and women include:' Family history: first degree relative with diabetes Ethnicity: increased risk for Asians, Hispanics, and African Americans Obesity Fat distribution: more fat around the middle High blood pressure High cholesterol Sedentary lifestyle (lack of exercise and/or not physically active) Smoking Excess alcohol intake Lack of sleep Low testosterone in men Unhealthy diet with high calorie content containing sugars and lacking beneficial compounds to increase wellness"
How does diabetes affect men differently than women?,"'Men who have ''type 2 diabetes'' are twice as likely to have ''low testosterone'' (low-T) than men who do not have diabetes. Because of the low levels of the hormone testosterone, men with diabetes can have unhealthy symptoms that are not seen in women with diabetes.''Low testosterone'' can cause ''decreased sex drive'', ''depression'', ''lack of energy'', and reduced muscle mass. It can also cause male-specific sexual problems and urological problems.''Erectile dysfunction'' (''ED'', ''impotence''), or inability to get or maintain an erection, is a common symptom of diabetes in men. Diabetic men experience ''erectile dysfunction'' at earlier ages than men who do not have diabetes.''Another diabetes-related sexual dysfunction symptom in men is reduced amounts of ejaculation, or retrograde ejaculation. Retrograde ejaculation is a condition in which the semen goes into the bladder, rather than out of the body through the urethra. Diabetes and damage to the blood vessels causes nerve damage to the muscles that control the bladder and urethra, which results in this problem.'  "
What are the long-term health complications of diabetes?,'Long-term diabetes-related complications include:' High blood pressure Heart disease Nerve damage and neuropathy (nerve pain) Kidney disease Retinopathy (nerve damage in the eye and/or blindness) Stroke Skin infections Peripheral vascular disease Yeast infections
Is there a test to diagnose type 1 and type 2 diabetes?,"'Your doctor or other healthcare provider will order urine and blood tests find out if you have diabetes. There are several different types of blood tests used to diagnose diabetes.' Fasting blood sugar test: After fasting for 12-hours a glucose level is checked in your blood. If it is high, it is indicative of diabetes. Hemoglobin A1C test: This test tells your doctor how your average blood glucose level has been over the past 2-3 months. Normal ranges for HbA1c are between 4% and 5.6%. HbA1c levels that range from 5.7% to 6.4% indicates increased risk of diabetes. HbA1c levels higher than 6.5% indicate diabetes, while higher percentages indicate either worsening diabetic disease or poor response to diabetic treatments. Random blood sugar test: This is a test of your blood sugar at the moment your blood is drawn, but this number can vary greatly based on when you last ate. Oral glucose tolerance test: This test is rarely used in men, but it measures your body’s response to a large amount of glucose."
What is diabetes mellitus?,"'Diabetes'' mellitus is a metabolic disorder that occurs when your blood ''sugar'' (glucose), is too high (''hyperglycemia''). Glucose is what the body uses for energy, and the pancreas produces a hormone called ''insulin'' that helps convert the glucose from the food you eat into energy. When the body does not produce enough ''insulin'' - or does not any at all - the glucose does not reach your cells to be used for energy. This results in type 1 and 2 ''diabetes''.'""According to the CDC, 30 million (9.4% of the US population), and 7.2 million Americans don't know that they have ""'diabetes''.''There are two types of ''diabetes''.''Type 1 diabetes'', formerly called juvenile ''diabetes'"", is an autoimmune condition in which the body does not produce insulin because the body's immune system attacks insulin-producing cells from the pancreas called beta cells.""'Type 2 diabetes'' is a condition in which cells cannot use blood ''sugar'' (glucose) efficiently for energy. This occurs when blood ''sugar'' gets too high over time, and the cells become insensitive to insulin.''Prediabetes'' (''sometimes spelled pre-''diabetes'') is a condition that often precedes ''type 2 diabetes''. ''Prediabetes'' is when your blood ''sugar'' is higher than normal, but not quite high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes. Prediabetes does not usually have any symptoms so there may be no warning signs. A blood test can confirm if you have prediabetes.'""More than 84 million American adults have prediabetes, and about 90% of people don't know that they have it. If a person does not change their ""'diet'' and lifestyle, prediabetes can become ''type 2 diabetes'' within 5 years.'  "
What are the early signs and symptoms in women with diabetes?,"'Many type 1 and type 2 ''diabetes symptoms'' in women are the same as those in men; however, there are some symptoms and complications of diabetes unique to women.''Vaginal itching'' and ''pain'' as well as vaginal and oral yeast infections: ''An overgrowth of ''Candida albicans'' fungus can cause vaginal yeast infections and oral yeast infections (''oral thrush''). Symptoms of vaginal yeast infections include:''Symptoms of oral ''thrush'' include:''5. Decrease in sex drive: ''Women with diabetes may experience lower sex drive (libido), blood flow problems to the genital area, which can decrease sexual response and ''orgasm'', and nerve damage (''diabetic neuropathy'') that can result in ''vaginal dryness'' and decreased sensation.''6. ''Polycystic ovary syndrome'' (''PCOS''): ''This is a common cause of female ''infertility'' and ''insulin resistance''. It can cause signs and symptoms like irregular periods, ''acne'', thinning ''scalp'' hair, and excess hair growth on the face and body. High insulin levels also increase the risk of developing diabetes, and about half of women with ''PCOS'' develop diabetes.''7. ''Urinary tract infections'' (''UTIs''):'' A ''UTI'' occurs when bacteria enter anywhere in the urinary tract, including the urethra, ureters, kidneys, and bladder. They are much more common in women than in men in general, and they occur more often in people with diabetes because the sugar in the urine presents a breeding ground for bacterial growth.' Vaginal itching and pain Vaginal discharge Painful sexual intercourse. White patches in the mouth Redness and soreness Trouble eating or swallowing Swollen red gums or inner cheeks."
What signs and symptoms are the same in men and women?,"'There are ''diabetes symptoms'' that both women and men have in common:''Some complications of type 1 and ''type 2 diabetes'' are the same, for example, skin, eye, circulation, ''low blood sugar'' (''hypoglycemia''), ''high blood sugar'' (''hyperglycemia''), ''ketoacidosis'', and amputation.' Excessive thirst and hunger Frequent urination Weight loss or gain Fatigue Irritability Blurred vision Slow-healing wounds Nausea Skin infections Darkening of skin in areas of body creases (acanthosis nigricans) Breath odor that is fruity, sweet, or acetone Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet"
What if you have diabetes and get pregnant ?,"'Diabetes need not affect a ''pregnancy'' if it is properly controlled. Women with diabetes should talk to their doctor when planning to conceive so they can get blood sugar levels under control before ''becoming pregnant''. You will need to understand how to monitor and control your diabetes and blood sugar levels during ''pregnancy''.''If you have ''high blood sugar'' levels during pregnancy, there are risks to both the baby and the mother. High blood glucose levels can result in:'  Premature delivery Difficult delivery or cesarean section (C-section) Miscarriage Preeclampsia (high blood pressure usually with protein in the urine) Birth defects Having a large baby Low blood glucose in a newborn Yellowing skin and eyes (jaundice) in a newborn Breathing problems in the newborn Worsening diabetic eye problems and kidney problems for the mother More frequent urinary or bladder infections"
What are the signs and symptoms of gestational diabetes?,"'Doctors will test for ''gestational diabetes'' during the 24th to 28th weeks of pregnancy, as this usually is when the condition develops. Often, ''gestational diabetes'' has no symptoms, but you may experience some symptoms common to diabetes such as:' Sugar in the urine (Your 
	doctor can perform a urinalysis to detect this.) Increased thirst. Frequent urination. Fatigue 
	or feeling tired more than usual. Nausea. Blurred vision. Feeling hungrier than usual. Weight loss 
	without trying. Increased infections (vaginal, bladder, and skin). Dry, itchy skin. Increase in vaginal yeast and urinary tract infection (UTI)."
What are the complications of diabetes during pregnancy?,"'When diabetes occurs in women during pregnancy, it is called ''gestational diabetes''. It usually is diagnosed between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy. Like in type 1 and ''type 2 diabetes'', blood sugar levels become too high. When women are ''pregnant'', more glucose is needed to nourish the developing baby. The body needs more insulin, which is produced by the pancreas. In some women, the body does not produce enough insulin to meet this need, and blood sugar levels rise, resulting in gestational diabetes.''Fortunately, for most women, gestational diabetes will go away once the baby is born. However, women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk for developing ''type 2 diabetes''.''Risk factors for gestational diabetes include:'  Being overweight or obese Family history of diabetes Ethnicity: higher risk for Hispanics, African Americans, Native Americans, Alaskan Natives, Asian Americans, or Pacific Islanders Age over 25 Previous gestational diabetes, stillbirth or miscarriage, or having a large baby (9 pounds or more) Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or another health condition known to be associated with insulin problems Problems with insulin or blood sugar, such as insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, or “prediabetes” High blood pressure High cholesterol Heart disease"
Can you die from diabetes?,"'Men, women, and children can develop diabetes, but the disease can present problems unique to women. A 2007 study found that between 1971 and 2000, death rates for men with diabetes declined, but death rates for women did not.''In general, women live longer than men do because they have a lower risk of ''heart disease'', but when women develop diabetes, their risk for ''heart disease'' skyrockets, and death by ''heart failure'' is more likely in women than in men. Another study also found that in people with diabetes, ''heart attacks'' are more often fatal for women than they are for men. Other examples of how diabetes affects women differently than men are:''Kidney disease'' is complication of ''type 1 diabetes'', and type 2, that affect women more strongly than men.''Depression'' is twice as common in women with diabetes as it is in men with diabetes.''Women with diabetes are more prone to ''poor blood sugar control ''(which can lead to hyperglycemia and ''hypoglycemia''), ''obesity'', high ''blood pressure'', and ''high cholesterol'' than men with diabetes.''There are several reasons suggested for why both type 1 and type 2 diabetes may affect women more dramatically than men:''In women with diabetes, the ''HDL'' (""''good"") ''cholesterol levels'' drop'', which results in greater ''heart disease'' risk, they have less estrogen, and lower levels of estrogen are associated with kidney disease. Women with diabetes may receive'' less effective health care'', particularly for ''heart disease'' and ''heart'' disease risk factors. Women with diabetes often have ''polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)'', which is a risk factor for diabetes, and can result in problems ''getting pregnant''. ' "
What should you do if you think that you may have diabetes or prediabetes?,"'If you notice any of the ''symptoms of diabetes'', see your doctor. If diabetes is untreated, it can lead to serious complications including ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', ''high blood pressure'', ''blindness'', ''kidney disease'', and nerve damage.''Your doctor will check your blood glucose levels, and if you are diagnosed with diabetes, your doctor will guide you on a plan to keep your blood sugar levels normal. If your diabetes is mild, your doctor will likely recommend a ''diet'' plan, ''exercise'', and ''weight loss''. Your doctor may prescribe medications that help reduce blood sugar levels. In some women, insulin may be necessary.' "
What is diabetes?,"'Diabetes mellitus'' is a metabolic disease characterized by ''high blood sugar'' (glucose) levels that result from defects in insulin secretion or the body’s ability to use insulin.''Normally, blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin lowers the blood glucose level. When the blood glucose elevates (for example, after eating food), insulin is released from the pancreas. This release of insulin promotes the uptake of glucose into body cells. In patients with diabetes, the absence of insufficient production or lack of response to insulin causes ''hyperglycemia''. Diabetes is a chronic medical condition, meaning that although it can be controlled, it lasts a lifetime.''In ''type 1 diabetes'', the pancreas cannot produce insulin. ''Type 1 diabetes'' was formerly known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is more a result of ''insulin resistance'' (cells not being able to use insulin effectively or at all. It was formerly known as adult-onset diabetes or ''non-insulin-dependent diabetes''.' "
What is prediabetes? How is it treated?,"'Prediabetes'' is the term used to describe elevated blood ''sugar'' (glucose) that has not yet reached the level for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. It can be treated by lifestyle changes such as consuming a healthy ''diet'', ''weight loss'', and regular ''exercise''.' "
What is the treatment for diabetes?,"'The major goal in treating type 1 and type 2 diabetes is to control blood sugar (glucose) levels within the normal range, with minimal excursions to low or high levels.''Type 1 diabetes is treated with:''Type 2 diabetes is treated:'   insulin, exercise, and a type 1 diabetes diet. First with weight reduction, a type 2 diabetes diet, and exercise Diabetes medications (oral or injected) are prescribed when these measures fail to control the elevated blood sugars of type 2 diabetes. If other medications become ineffective treatment with insulin may be initiated."
Diabetes diet,"'Proper ''nutrition'' is essential for all people with diabetes. Control of blood glucose levels is only one goal of a healthy eating plan. A diabetic ''diet'' helps achieve and maintain a normal body weight, while preventing the common cardiac and vascular complications of diabetes.''There is no prescribed diet plan for diabetes and no single “''diabetes diet'""”. Eating plans are tailored to fit each individual's needs, schedules, and eating habits. Each diabetes diet plan must be balanced with the intake of insulin and other diabetes medications. In general, the principles of a healthy diabetes diet are the same for everyone. Consumption of various foods in a healthy diet includes whole grains, fruits, non-fat dairy products, beans, lean meats, ""'vegetarian'' substitutes, poultry, or fish.''People with diabetes may benefit from eating small meals throughout the day, instead of eating one or two heavy meals. No foods are absolutely forbidden for people with diabetes. Attention to ''portion control'' and advance meal planning can help people with diabetes enjoy the same meals as everyone else.''Glycemic index'' and glycemic load are further considerations in considering a meal plan for people with diabetes. Foods with low glycemic index and load raise blood sugar more slowly than high glycemic index/load foods. Glycemic index refers to a standardized measurement, while glycemic load takes a typical portion size into account.''Meal timing and amount of insulin administration are considerations when planning a diet for people with type 1 diabetes.'""Weight reduction and exercise are important treatments for type 2 diabetes. Weight reduction and exercise increase the body's sensitivity to insulin, thus helping to control blood sugar elevations.""

Medications for type 2 diabetes,"'Note that these medications used to treat type 2 diabetes are typically not used in ''pregnant'' or ''breastfeeding'' women. At present the only recommended way of controlling diabetes in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding is by diet, exercise, and insulin therapy. You should speak with your health-care professional if you are taking these medications, are considering ''becoming pregnant'', or if you have become pregnant while taking these medications.''Medications for type 2 diabetes are designed to''A preferred drug can provide more than one benefit (for example, lower blood sugar and control ''cholesterol''). Varying combinations of medications can control diabetes. Not every patient with type 2 diabetes will benefit from every drug, and not every drug is suitable for each patient.''The medications for type 2 diabetes fall into specific classes based upon the way they work to achieve control of blood sugar. These drug classes include:'   increase insulin output by the pancreas, decrease the amount of glucose released from the liver, increase the sensitivity (response) of cells to insulin, decrease the absorption of carbohydrates from the intestine, and slow emptying of the stomach, thereby delaying nutrient digestion and absorption in the small intestine."
Metformin,"'Metformin'' is a biguanide drug that increases the sensitivity of the body’s cells to insulin. It also decreases the amount of glucose produced by the liver.. In 1994, the FDA approved the use of the biguanide called metformin (''Glucophage'') for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Today, this is still typically the first drug prescribed for type 2 diabetes.''In addition, metformin tends to suppress appetite, which may benefit people who are ''overweight''.''Metformin often does not reduce blood glucose enough on its own and may be given with other medications such as other oral ''drugs'' or insulin.''Possible side effects of metformin include ''nausea'' and ''diarrhea''. These usually resolve over time.' "
Sulfonylureas,"'Medications that increase insulin output by the pancreas belong to the class of drugs called sulfonylureas. Older generations of these drugs include ''chlorpropamide'' (''Diabinese'') and tolbutamide were abandoned due to association with higher risk of cardiovascular events.''The newer sulfonylurea drugs include ''glyburide'' (DiaBeta), ''glipizide'' (''Glucotrol''), and ''glimepiride'' (''Amaryl'').''These drugs rapidly lower blood sugar, but can cause abnormally ''low blood sugar'' (called ''hypoglycemia''). In addition, sulfonylureas contain sulfa and should be avoided by those who are ''allergic'' to sulfa. ''Weight gain'' is a possible side effect of the sulfonylurea drugs.' "
Meglitinides ,"'Like the sulfonylureas, meglitinides is a class of drugs that work by promoting insulin secretion from the pancreas. Unlike the sulfonylureas, which last longer in the body, ''repaglinide'' (''Prandin'') and ''nateglinide'' (''Starlix'') are very short acting, with peak effects within one hour. For this reason, they are given up to three times a day just before meals.''Since these drugs increase circulating insulin levels they may cause hypoglycemia. Weight gain is also a possible side effect.' "
Thiazolidinediones,'Thiazolidinedione drugs lower blood glucose by increasing the sensitivity of the cells to insulin (improving target cell response to insulin). Examples include ''pioglitazone'' (''Actos'') and ''rosiglitazone'' (''Avandia'')''These drugs have been linked to serious side effects like an increased risk of ''heart failure'' and bone ''fractures''. Weight gain is another possible side effect. These medications are not usually given as a first-line treatment but may be helpful for some people.' 
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors,"'Drugs of this class decrease the absorption of carbohydrates from the intestine. Before being absorbed into the bloodstream, enzymes in the small intestine must break down carbohydrates into smaller sugar particles, such as glucose. One of the enzymes involved in breaking down carbohydrates is called alpha-glucosidase. By inhibiting this enzyme, carbohydrates are not broken down as efficiently, and glucose absorption is delayed.''The alpha-glucosidase inhibitors available in the U.S. are ''acarbose'' (''Precose'') and ''miglitol'' (Lexicomp). These drugs have gastrointestinal side effects such as ''abdominal pain'', dairrhea, and ''gas''.' "
SGLT2 inhibitors ,"""These are a relatively new class of drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes. They are oral medications that work by blocking the kidneys' reabsorption of glucose, leading to increased glucose excretion and reduction of blood sugar levels. The US FDA approved the ""'SGLT2 inhibitors'' ''canagliflozin'' (''Invokana'') in March 2013 and ''dapagliflozin'' (''Farxiga'') in January 2014.''Side effects are similar for these drugs and include vaginal ''yeast infection'' and ''urinary tract infection''. Each of these drugs has been used as a single therapy and in combination with other drugs such as metformin, sulfonylurea, pioglitazone, and insulin.' "
DPP-4 inhibitors ,"'Incretin is a natural hormone that tells the body to release insulin after eating. An enzyme called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) removes incretin from your body. Stopping (inhibiting) DPP-4 helps the incretin that is in the body to stay there longer. This triggers insulin to be released, which lowers blood sugar.''In 2006, the FDA approved the first drug in this class called ''sitagliptin'' (''Januvia''). Other members of this drug class are saxagliptin (Onglyza), ''linagliptin'' (''Tradjenta''), and alogliptin (Nusina).''Side effects of the DPP-4 inhibitors include symptoms of respirtaory and ''urinary tract infections''. They are not associated with weight gain.' "
GLP-1 receptor agonists ,"'GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) is an incretin, a hormone that signals the body to release insulin after eating. A GLP-1 agonist drug works in a similar manner to DPP-4 inhibitors, by stimulating action of the incretin GLP-1. GLP-1 agonists are also known as incretin mimetics. Their effects are stronger than those of the DPP-4 inhibitors.''Exenatide'' (''Byetta'') was the first drug of the GLP-1 agonist group. It originated from an interesting source, the saliva of the Gila monster. Scientists observed that this small lizard could go a long time without eating. They discovered a substance in its saliva that slowed stomach emptying, thus making the lizard feel fuller for a longer time. This substance resembled the hormone GLP-1.''Other drugs in this class have since been developed. They include ''liraglutide'' (''Victoza''), long-acting exenatide (Bydureon), albiglutide (Tanzeum), and ''dulaglutide'' (''Trulicity'').''These drugs slow stomach emptying and slows the release of glucose from the liver, thereby regulating delivery of nutrients to the intestine for absorption. They may also work in the brain to regulate hunger and are therefore associated with ''weight loss''.''GLP-1 receptor agonists are often associated with some ''weight loss''. This class of medications is not used alone but rather in combination with other drugs. Possible side effects include ''nausea'' and an increased risk of ''pancreatitis''.' "
Pramlintide (Symlin),"'Pramlintide'' (''Symlin'') was the first in a class of injectable, anti-hyperglycemic medications for use in addition to insulin for type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. Pramlintide is a synthetic analog of human amylin, a naturally occurring hormone made by the pancreas to help control glucose after meals. Similar to insulin, amylin is absent or deficient in person with diabetes.''Pramlintide used with insulin reduces post-meal blood sugar peaks, reduces glucose fluctuations throughout the day, enhances satiety (the sensation of fullness) leading to potential weight loss, and lowers mealtime insulin requirements.''Pramlintide is administered by injection just prior to meals (three times each day) for type 1 diabetes as an additional treatment to mealtime insulin therapy for those failing to achieve desired glucose control despite optimal insulin therapy and type 2 diabetes as an additional treatment to mealtime insulin therapy for those failing to achieve desired glucose control with optimal insulin therapy.''Pramlintide with insulin has been associated with an increased risk of insulin-induced severe hypoglycemia, particularly in type 1 diabetes. This severe hypoglycemia occurs within 3 hours of injecting pramlintide. Nausea is another possible side effect.' "
Combination medications for type 2 diabetes,"'Glyburide/metformin'' (''Glucovance''), ''rosiglitazone/metformin'' (''Avandamet''), ''glipizide/metformin'' (''Metaglip''), pioglitazone/metformin (Actoplusmet), and metformin/sitagliptin (''Janumet'') are five examples of combination pills on the market to treat type 2 diabetes. There are many, many more combination pills available.''These combination drugs carry the benefit of taking fewer pills, which hopefully improves compliance. While they work well, most health-care professionals initiate individual medications to optimize dosing, before switching to a combination pill once the patient has been stable on individual medications for a while.' "
Treatment of diabetes with insulin,"'Insulin remains the mainstay of treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes. Insulin is also an important therapy for type 2 diabetes when blood glucose levels cannot be controlled by diet, weight loss, exercise, and oral medications.''Ideally, insulin should be administered in a manner that mimics the natural pattern of insulin secretion by a healthy pancreas. However, the complex pattern of natural insulin secretion is difficult to duplicate. Still, adequate blood glucose control can be achieved with careful attention to diet, regular exercise, home blood glucose monitoring, and multiple insulin injections throughout the day.''Various formulations of insulin differ in\xa0pharmacokinetics, i.e., the amount of time until they begin to work and the duration of their action after injection. These different insulins allow for more tailored regimens to optimize blood sugar control. The ''types of insulin'' currently available are:'   Rapid-acting insulin begins to take effect 5 minutes after administration. Peak effect occurs in about 1 hour, and the effect lasts for 2 to 4 hours. Examples are insulin lispro, insulin aspart, and insulin glulisine. Regular insulin takes effect within 30 minutes, peaks at 2 to 3 hours after injection, and lasts 3 to 6 hours total. Intermediate-acting insulin typically begins to lower blood glucose about 2 to 4 hours after injection, peaks 4 to 12 hours later, and lasts about 12 to 18 hours. Long-acting insulin takes effect within 6 to 10 hours. It usually lastes for 20 to 24 hours. The long-acting insulin analogues include glargine and detemir. The lower glucose levels fairly evenly over a 24-hour period (without major peaks or troughs)."
Different methods of delivering insulin,"'Not only is the variety of insulin preparations growing, so are the methods for administering insulin.''In the twentieth century, insulin was available only in an injectable form that required carrying syringes, needles, vials of insulin, and ''alcohol'' swabs. Clearly, patients found it difficult to take multiple shots each day; as a result, good blood sugar control was often difficult. Many pharmaceutical companies now offer discreet and convenient methods for delivering insulin.''Many manufacturers offer pen delivery systems. Such systems resemble the ink cartridge in a fountain pen. A small, pen-sized device holds an insulin cartridge (usually containing 300 units). Cartridges are available for the most widely used insulin formulations. The amount of insulin to be injected is dialed in, by turning the bottom of the pen until the required number of units is seen in the dose-viewing window. The tip of the pen consists of a needle that is replaced with each injection. A release mechanism allows the needle to penetrate just under the skin and deliver the required amount of insulin.''An insulin pump is composed of a reservoir similar to that of an insulin cartridge, a battery-operated pump, and a computer chip that allows the user to control the exact amount of insulin being delivered. The pump is attached to a thin ''plastic'' tube (an infusion set) that has a cannula (like a needle but soft) at the end through which insulin passes. This cannula is inserted under the skin, usually on the abdomen.. The pump continuously delivers insulin, 24 hours a day. The amount of insulin is programmed and is administered at a constant rate (basal rate). Often, the amount of insulin needed over the course of 24 hours varies, depending on factors like exercise, activity level, and ''sleep''. The insulin pump allows the user to program many different basal rates to allow for variations in lifestyle. The user can also program the pump to deliver additional insulin during meals, covering the excess demands for insulin caused by eating carbohydrates.''The most exciting innovation in pump technology has been the ability to combine the pump in tandem with newer glucose sensing technology. This is called sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy.''A newer option involves devices that use sensors that communicate directly with the insulin pump. One device is approved by the FDA that is a hybrid system (not fully automated), in which the basal insulin doses are automatically adjusted depending on results from the sensor. Users need to manually request insulin doses prior to meals.' "
Alternative treatments for diabetes,"'There have been some small, limited studies as well as anecdotal reports that certain alternative or “natural” treatments can help control blood glucose levels in people with diabetes or otherwise prevent the condition or prevent its complications. These can include herbs or ''dietary supplements''. Examples include ''garlic'', cinnamon, alpha-lipoic acid, aloe vera, chromium, ''ginseng'', and magnesium.''These substances are not considered to be medications by the US FDA and are therefore not regulated as such. This means that there are no standards in place to ensure that a given product contains the substance or dose as described on the label. There are also no requirements to perform studies showing that the products are safe or effective. Side effects of ''supplements'' are typically not well understood, and some ''supplements'' can interfere with the action of medications.''The American Diabetes Association publishes treatment guidelines for physicians based on all available scientific evidence. In the 2018 guidelines document, Standard of Medical Care in Diabetes, the ADA states that there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of any of the proposed alternative treatments for diabetes. These guidelines state that:' There continues to be no clear evidence of benefit from herbal or nonherbal (for example, vitamin or mineral) supplementation for people with diabetes without underlying deficiencies. Routine supplementation with antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C and carotene, is not advised due to lack of evidence of efficacy and concern related to long-term safety. There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of herbals and micronutrients, such as cinnamon and vitamin D, to improve glycemic control in people with diabetes"
Which specialties of doctors treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes?,"'Endocrinologists are the specialists in endocrine disorders such as diabetes and as such, manage many patients with diabetes. Primary care specialists, including internists and family practice specialists, may also treat patients with diabetes.' "
What is type 1 diabetes?,"""Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that affects blood sugar regulation. A person's immune system makes antibodies that destroy the insulin-producing islet beta cells in the pancreas. The pancreas then fails to make insulin. Without insulin, blood sugar increases and cannot be delivered to the muscles and brain where it is needed. Over time, ""'high blood sugar'' can lead to a number of complications such as kidney, nerve, and eye damage, and ''cardiovascular disease''. Moreover, cells do not receive the glucose necessary for energy and normal function.''Because type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, cures will likely involve replacing the damaged pancreas or promoting regeneration or functioning of the pancreas. Because people with type 1 diabetes can no longer produce their own insulin, they must inject doses of insulin. They must match the amount of insulin they inject with their ''diet''. Keeping blood sugar in a normal, healthy range (what doctors call ""good glycemic control"") is the key to preventing long-term complications.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes?,"'Type 1 diabetes can be subtle or life threatening. Some people have no symptoms (asymptomatic), and type 1 diabetes is not detected until blood or urine lab studies are done. If a person does have type 1 ''diabetes symptoms'', early signs and symptoms are''Other signs and symptoms are''People with type 1 diabetes may experience more frequent infections of the skin or respiratory tract.''Undiagnosed type 1 diabetes can become life threatening if a person goes into ketoacidosis (a state in which elevated blood sugar leads to other metabolic changes).'   weight loss, thirst, and excessive urination. an unusual odor to the urine, urinary tract infections (UTIs), yeast infections, unexplained weight loss, feeling hungry even after meals, stomach pain, diarrhea, fatigue, swollen ankles, darkening skin around the armpits or groin, night sweats, blurry vision, fruity or unusual breath, hair loss, and generally feeling unwell (malaise)."
What is the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes?,"'The major process that happens in type 1 diabetes is that the pancreas can no longer produce insulin. ''Type 2 diabetes'' is more a result of ''insulin resistance'' (cells not being able to use insulin effectively or at all), that is, it takes a large amount of insulin to move glucose out of the blood and into the cells. Over time, people with type 2 diabetes also may experience decreased insulin production in the pancreas. In type 1 diabetes, over time, the body can also develop insulin resistance -- especially in people who gain a lot of weight while using insulin. This means there is some overlap in treatment and ''diet'' for people who have had diabetes of either type for a long time.' "
How many people have type 1 diabetes?,'Most people with diabetes (90%-95% of all those with the condition) have type 2 diabetes. Around 1.25 million American children and adults have type 1 diabetes.' 
Is type 1 diabetes a genetic (inherited) disease?,"'There is a strong genetic link with type 1 diabetes. This can be tested for by looking at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype. First-degree relatives are at higher risk. However, with any genetic condition, it is important to remember that gene expression changes in response to the epigenetic (nutritional) environment, and risk factors can be addressed with a health care professional or ''nutrition''/functional/naturopathic practitioner knowledgeable about epigenetics.'

How do you develop type 1 diabetes (causes)?,"'Type 1 diabetes is caused by the autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin. It is not known why the autoimmune destruction happens. However, there are some known triggers, for example:''The underlying cause of type 1 diabetes usually is not known.' Genetics, including family history and the prenatal environment of the mother, can put people at risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Exposures to chemicals, especially ones called endocrine disruptors, found in plastics Viral infections also can trigger the autoimmune process. Early or late introduction of certain foods to infants has been shown to trigger type 1 diabetes in research studies. Introducing fruit before 5 months of age or waiting until later than 7 months to introduce grains such as oats and rice increases the risk of diabetes. However, research shows that breastfeeding reduces these risks."
What are risk factors for developing type 1 diabetes?,"'Risk factors for developing type 1 diabetes include prenatal exposures, exposures to food and environmental toxins early in life, and geography.' Prenatal exposures include maternal preeclampsia or metabolic syndrome . Environmental exposures include chemicals, especially those found in plastics and foods, specifically introduction of gluten, casein (the protein in dairy) or fruit before 4 months of age or late introduction (after 7 months of age) to grains (gluten, oat, and rice) and casein. Viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus or EBV (mononucleosis), Coxsackie, CMV, and other infections can also be risk factors for developing type 1 diabetes. Living in a northern climate is a risk factor that has not been fully explained."
Type 1 diabetes and pregnancy,"'Pregnant'' women with type 1 diabetes need to be extra careful to maintain good blood sugar control. If blood sugar runs too high during ''pregnancy'', there is an increased risk of complications including having a very large baby, having the baby too early, and having ''preeclampsia'', a condition that can be life threatening to the mother and baby. You can minimize the risk for complications by paying close attention to blood sugar, eating a low-glycemic diet, and staying regularly active.' "
How is type 1 diabetes diagnosed?," Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed with a blood test for blood glucose. If it is greater than 125 when fasting or greater than 200 randomly, a diagnosis of diabetes is made. To confirm whether it is type 1 or type 2 diabetes, blood tests are used to measure antibodies. Additionally, a presumptive diagnosis can be made based on glucose or ketones in the urine. A c-peptide test can determine how much insulin the pancreas is producing. Genetic testing, such as HLA subtyping, can add further understanding of the disease."
What is the treatment for type 1 diabetes? Can it be cured?,"'Currently, type 1 diabetes cannot be cured. People with type 1 diabetes require injectable insulin because their pancreas does not produce enough on its own. There are different ''types of insulin'' and different routes of administration. Most people with type 1 diabetes use both a long-acting insulin (sometimes called a basal insulin), and inject additional insulin before or after meals (sometimes called regular or short-acting insulin) to match the carbohydrate content of the meal. An ''insulin pump'"" may also be used to optimize insulin delivery to the body's needs."" Unfortunately, one of the major side effects of insulin is weight gain. People with type 1 diabetes can reduce weight gain by:Eating a healthy low-carbohydrate (low-glycemic load) diet,Getting plenty of exercise, andLearning to use insulin correctly in order to use just the right amountDiet and level of activity. Eating a healthy low-carbohydrate (low-glycemic load) diet, Getting plenty of exercise, and Learning to use insulin correctly in order to use just the right amount Diet and level of activity. Because type 1 diabetes is characterized by the loss of insulin production in the pancreas, insulin must be provided in the form of an injection. In addition to insulin, treatment includes diet changes to minimize sugars and make sure carbohydrates are matched with the appropriate dose of insulin. There are different forms of insulin and different ways it can be administered. A type 1 diabetes diet should focus on lots of vegetables and healthy proteins such as fish, chicken, and beans; and should be low in sweets and processed baked goods. A healthy diet helps blood sugar control and helps with weight loss."
Is there a type 1 diabetes diet?,"'The basics of a type 1 ''diabetes diet'' include making sure carbohydrate intake is matched with insulin and choosing healthy options to maximize ''nutrition'' in each calorie. People with type 1 diabetes will find it is easiest to match carbohydrates to insulin if they follow a low-glycemic load (index) diet, so that the impact of carbohydrates on blood sugar is slow and gradual. This also makes it easier to predict and match to required insulin.''Because weight gain can be a side effect of injecting insulin, a type 1 diabetes diet should be healthy and low in calories to help the person maintain or ''lose weight''. Food lists of low-glycemic load options can help people learn what to include in their diet.' "
Does exercise affect blood sugar levels?," Exercise is important for everyone, including people with type 1 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes need to be careful to monitor their blood sugar before, during, and after exercise and have snacks with them in case blood sugar goes too low. When people exercise, the muscles use insulin to access blood sugar for fuel. This can lead to lower than expected blood sugar. Exercise also may trigger release of stored glucose from the liver. This can lead to higher than expected blood sugar. This is why it is important to check blood sugar, especially when beginning a new exercise program. People with type 1 diabetes may see their blood sugar go up or down with exercise."
What is the life expectancy for someone with type 1 diabetes?,"'Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that people with type 1 diabetes live about 11 years less than average; however, new research also suggests this differential can be reduced with good glycemic control. Most people with type 1 diabetes die from complications of type 1 diabetes such as ''heart disease'' or kidney disease. Thus, preventing complications and following a healthy lifestyle that prevents ''heart disease'' and controls blood sugar are the best things people with type 1 diabetes can do to live a long, healthy life.' "
What are the complications of type 1 diabetes?,"'Uncontrolled blood sugar can lead to a number long-term complications associated with diabetes such as''If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes you can prevent complications by maintaining a healthy blood sugar level, eating a healthy diet rich in vegetables, and staying physically active.' diabetic eye disease, foot problems, neuropathy, sexual problems, urinary tract infections, skin infections, yeast infections, a higher risk for other infections, heart disease, and kidney disease."
Can type 1 diabetes be prevented?,"'While there is not any definitive way to prevent type 1 diabetes, parents can be aware of the risk factors in the prenatal period and in early childhood to minimize risk. For people who already have type 1 diabetes, prevention of complications through good glycemic control and regular medical screening is key.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat type 1 diabetes?,"'Adult and pediatric endocrinologists, specialists in treating hormonal disorders and disorders of the endocrine system, manage patients with diabetes. A number of primary care doctors including family and internal medicine doctors, naturopathic doctors, or nurse practitioners also may care for people with type 1 diabetes. When complications arise, people with diabetes often consult other specialists, including neurologists, gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists, surgeons, and cardiologists. Nutritionists, integrative and functional medicine doctors, and physical activity experts such as personal trainers are also important members of a ''diabetes treatment'' team.' "
What is type 2 diabetes?,"'Type 2 diabetes'"" is the most common type of diabetes. It is a chronic condition in which blood glucose (sugar) can no longer be regulated. There are two reasons for this. First, the cells of the body become resistant to insulin (insulin resistant). Insulin works like a key to let glucose (blood sugar) move out of the blood and into the cells where it is used as fuel for energy. When the cells become insulin resistant, moving sugar into the cells requires more and more insulin, and too much sugar stays in the blood. Over time, if the cells require more and more insulin, the pancreas can't make enough insulin to keep up and begins to fail."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes?,"'This type of diabetes develops gradually, over years, so the signs and symptoms can seem subtle, and you might think it is something you ""just have to live with."" If you are overweight or ''obese'', this is the major symptom, but not everyone will be overweight. In fact, ''weight loss'' can be a symptom.''Other symptoms and signs include:'   Fatigue Frequent urination Excess thirst Blurry or cloudy vision Wounds that won't heal Tingling or numbness in the feet Erectile dysfunction (ED) Dark skin under the armpits and around the groin"
What are the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)?,"'Type 2 diabetes is a condition of blood sugar dysregulation. In general blood sugar is too high, but it also can be too low. This can happen if you take your ''diabetes medications'' then skip a meal. Blood sugar also can rise very quickly after a high ''glycemic index'' meal, and then fall a few hours later, plummeting into hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). The signs and ''symptoms of hypoglycemia'' can include' Feeling dizzy or light-headed Difficulty concentrating or making decisions Feeling sweaty or clammy Vision changes, like blurring or narrowing of the visual field Feeling physically weak Feeling sleepy Feeling irritable"
What are the signs and symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia)?,"'Hyperglycemia, or ''high blood sugar'', is common in type 2 diabetes. Its signs and symptoms can be either acute (short in duration) or chronic (last over a long period of time).' Feeling tired Feeling vision is blurry or foggy Frequent urination Feeling very thirsty Darkening skin under armpits, neck, thighs Fungal infections on the skin like ringworm or toenail fungus Weight gain Difficulty with sexual function Numbness, tingling, or burning sensations in the feet"
What causes type 2 diabetes? Can it be reversed?,"'Type 2 diabetes can be reversed with diligent attention to changing lifestyle behaviors. Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of genetics and unhealthy lifestyle habits.'  Some ethnic groups have a higher inherited incidence of it. African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders are all at increased risk. Other causes include unhealthy lifestyle habits, for example, if you:Eat too much sugar and carbohydratesEat or drink foods with artificial sweetenersDon't get enough exerciseAre under chronic, high stress Eat too much sugar and carbohydrates Eat or drink foods with artificial sweeteners Don't get enough exercise Are under chronic, high stress"
What is the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes?," If you have type 2, you can lower high blood sugar levels with diet, exercise, and oral drugs that either make the body more sensitive to insulin or help the pancreas release more insulin. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas cannot make any insulin, and people have to depend on insulin injections to lower blood sugar. Over time, people with type 2 also can require insulin. This happens when the pancreas ""wears out."""
Who gets type 2 diabetes (risk factors)?,"'Risk factors for type 2 diabetes are:''Lifestyle habits can contribute to a person developing the disease, for example:' Age (being over age 45) A family history of diabetes Being of a race or ethnic group with a genetic predisposition for this type of diabetes Being overweight Having had prediabetes or gestational diabetes Having other metabolic syndrome conditions such as high blood pressure, low HDL or ""good"" cholesterol, or high triglycerides If you are overweight or obese If you are sedentary (you don't exercise and are not physically active) If you watch more than 2 hours of TV per day If you drink artificially sweetened or sugar sweetened products. These products increase your risk by 26%-67%. Economic stress. People who live in the lowest-income circumstances have 2 1/2 times greater risk of developing the disease."
Is there a blood test to diagnose type 2 diabetes?,"'Yes, there is a blood test to diagnose this disease. The blood is tested for glucose, and if it is greater than 125 fasting, or more than 200 when randomly tested, the diagnosis is diabetes. If the fasting blood sugar is between 100-125, the person has a diagnosis of prediabetes.''Tests also can measure average blood sugar over time. A ''hemoglobin A1c'' (HbA1c) test greater than 6.5% indicates the diagnosis of the disease. Prediabetes is diagnosed with an HbA1c of 5.7% - 6.4%.' "
What is the treatment for type 2 diabetes?,"'Treatment for this type of diabetes can include:''Not all people with diabetes need drug therapy. A healthy eating plan and exercise alone can be enough if the person makes significant lifestyle changes. Other signs, symptoms, and complications also may need treatment. For example, nutritional deficiencies should be corrected, heart or kidney disease may need to be treated, and vision must be checked for eye problems like ''diabetic retinopathy''.' Diabetic eating plan Exercise Weight loss Oral drugs Injectable drugs Treating other problems like stress or sleep apnea Dietary supplements"
Is there a type 2 diabetes diet plan?,"'If you have this type of diabetes, the foods you eat should have a low-glycemic load (index) -- foods higher in ''fiber'', protein, or ''fats'' -- like vegetables and good quality protein such as fish, chicken, beans, and lentils. From that base, add other types of nutritious foods like fruit, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and nuts.''Avoid foods with a high glycemic index (foods that raise blood sugar too quickly) such as processed foods, and foods high in carbohydrates, sugars, or animal fat. Examples of foods to avoid include:''A good rule of thumb is to avoid white foods (except for cauliflower!).'   Desserts Sweets Pastries Breads Chips Crackers Pasta"
Can exercise help manage type 2 diabetes?,"'Exercise is very important if you have this health condition. Exercise makes cells more insulin sensitive, pulling glucose out of the blood. This brings down blood sugar, and more importantly, gives you better energy because the glucose is being transferred to the cells. Any type of exercise will do this, but you gain extra benefit when the activity helps build muscle, such as weight training or using resistance bands. The ''benefits of exercise'' on blood sugar last about 48-72 hours, so it is important for you to be physically active almost every day.' "
What medications treat type 2 diabetes?,"'There are different types of ''diabetes drugs''. They work in different ways to either stop the ''liver'"" from making glucose, make the pancreas release more insulin, or block glucose from being absorbed. Insulin replaces the natural insulin when the pancreas can't make it any longer.""'Metformin (Glucophage, Glucophage XR, ''Glumetza'', ''Fortamet'', ''Riomet'') belongs to a class of drugs called biguanides. Metformin is first-line therapy for most type 2 diabetics. It works to stop the liver from making excess glucose, and has a low risk of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia, or very low blood sugar can cause symptoms such as ''sweating'', nervousness, heart ''palpitations'', ''weakness'', intense hunger, trembling, and problems speaking. Many patients lose some weight taking metformin, which is also helpful for blood sugar control.''Sulfonureas and meglitinides are classes of drugs also prescribed for treatment. These drugs cause the pancreas to release more insulin. Since the pancreas can only work so hard, these drugs have a limited duration of usefulness.''The sulfonureas include:''The meglitinides include:''Canagliflozin'' (''Invokana'') and ''dapagliflozin'' (''Farxiga'') are oral medications prescribed to treat type 2 diabetics. These drugs belong to the drug class referred to as sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. These drugs work by stopping the absorption of glucose in the kidneys, enabling some of it to be urinated out.''There are other oral and injectable drugs for patients with type 2 diabetics such as:'""For people who want to avoid drugs, taking an aggressive approach to healthy eating plan and lifestyle change is an option. It isn't easy, but if someone is very committed and motivated, lifestyle changes can be enough to maintain a healthy blood sugar level and to ""'lose weight''.

Do people with type 2 diabetes have to take insulin?,"'Insulin is only recommended for individuals with type 2 diabetes when they have not been able to get blood sugars low enough to prevent complications through other means. To avoid insulin, those with this health condition should work very hard to follow a healthy eating plan that includes a lot of vegetables and lean proteins, exercise every day, and keep stress in perspective. They also should take their oral drugs regularly. It can be difficult to follow these recommendations and the help of your doctor, nutritionist, diabetes educator, health coach, or integrative medicine practitioner may be helpful. If you want to avoid taking medicine, work with health professionals who are knowledgeable about lifestyle medicine and can help you understand how to fit the changes into your life.' "
What if I have type 2 diabetes and become pregnant?,"'If you are a diabetic and are ''pregnant'' you can have a normal, healthy ''pregnancy'', but you need to take extra steps to avoid gaining excess weight and high blood sugars. Lifestyle habits (eating primarily vegetables and lean protein and exercising every day) will prevent problems during pregnancy. If you are a diabetic and become pregnant, monitor your blood sugar levels often. Talk with your doctor about exploring additional health care professionals, for example, a nutritionist, health coach, or naturopathic doctor about a healthy eating plan. If your blood sugar gets out of control you may:' Have a large baby Get preeclampsia Have a premature birth"
What are the complications of type 2 diabetes?,"'If blood sugar is not controlled over time, complications can develop. These include:''If you have diabetes, you have a higher risk of ''heart disease'' and ''heart attack''. Because of this, it is important to control cholesterol and ''high blood pressure'' in addition to blood sugar. The good news is that all of these diseases are responsive to healthy lifestyle changes.' Diabetic eye disease Heart disease Foot problems such as wounds that don't heal, loss of feeling, or pins and needles sensations Neuropathy or nerve pain especially in the legs and feet Sexual issues such as erectile dysfunction, inability to orgasm or feel full sensation Urinary frequency Unusual odor to urine"
Can type 2 diabetes be prevented?,"'A healthy lifestyle can prevent almost all cases of type 2 diabetes. A large research study called the ''Diabetes Prevention'' Program, found that people who made intensive lifestyle changes including diet and exercise reduced their risk of developing diabetes by 58%. Those over 60 years old seemed to experience extra benefit; they reduced their risk by 71%. In comparison, people who were given the drug metformin for diabetes ''prevention'' only reduced their risk by 31%.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for someone with type 2 diabetes?,"'Some research shows that people with type 2 diabetes may die 10 years earlier than those without diabetes. Most people with the disease die of secondary complications of it, for example ''kidney failure'' or ''heart disease''. However, with good blood sugar control and healthy lifestyle choices, complications can be prevented.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat type 2 diabetes?,"'Adult and pediatric endocrinologists, specialists in treating hormone imbalances and disorders of the endocrine system, are experts in helping patients with diabetes manage their disease. People with the disease also may seek care from a number of primary care providers including family or internal medicine practitioners, naturopathic doctors, or nurse practitioners. When complications arise, these patients often consult other specialists, including neurologists, gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists, acupuncturists, surgeons, and cardiologists. Nutritionists, integrative and functional medicine doctors, and physical activity experts such as personal trainers are also important members of a ''diabetes treatment'' team. It is important to interview new health care professionals about their experience, expertise, and credentials to make sure they are well qualified to help you.' "
Facts you should know about urine tests for diabetes," Urine tests may be done in people with diabetes to evaluate severe hyperglycemia (severe high blood sugar) by looking for ketones in the urine. Ketones are a metabolic product produced when fat is metabolized. Ketones increase when there is insufficient insulin to use glucose for energy. Urine tests are also done to look for the presence of protein in the urine, which is a sign of kidney damage. Urine glucose measurements are less reliable than blood glucose measurements and are not used to diagnose diabetes or evaluate treatment for diabetes. They may be used for screening purposes. Testing for ketones is most common in people with type 1 diabetes. Both people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes typically have microalbumin testing."
What are urine tests for diabetes?,"""Urine tests are tests performed in a clinical laboratory or at home using self-test kits and a sample of the patient's urine. Urine tests can be performed for a variety of reasons, but in people with ""'diabetes'', they are most commonly used to look for ketones or microalbumin (see below). Urine glucose (''sugar'') can also be measured, but this is less valuable than blood glucose levels for diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes, so this is not commonly done as a way to monitor blood glucose status.'  "
Ketone test,"'This test detects the presence of ketones, which are byproducts of metabolism that form in the presence of severe hyperglycemia (elevated blood ''sugar''). Ketones are formed from fat that is burned by the body when there is insufficient insulin to allow glucose to be used for fuel. When ketones build up to high levels, ''ketoacidosis'' (a serious and life-threatening condition) may occur.''Ketone testing can be performed both at home and in the clinical laboratory. Ketones can be detected by dipping a test strip into a sample of urine. A color change on the test strip signals the presence of ketones in the urine. Ketones occur most commonly in people with ''type 1 diabetes'', but uncommonly, people with ''type 2 diabetes'' may test positive for ketones.' "
Microalbumin test,"'The microalbumin test detects microalbumin, a type of protein, in the urine. Protein is present in the urine when there is damage to the kidneys. Since the damage to blood vessels that occurs as a complication of diabetes can lead to kidney problems, the microalbumin test is done to check for damage to the kidneys over time.' "
Can urine tests diagnose diabetes?,"'While urine tests can show signs that may signal diabetes, such as elevated sugar or ketones, the diagnosis of diabetes is made on the basis of blood tests. Urine tests may be done in some cases as back-up testing or for screening to see if blood tests should be done, but the diagnosis of diabetes is made after blood glucose testing.' "
When are urine tests used in people with diabetes?,"'The ketone test is generally recommended for people with type 1 diabetes. Those with type 1 diabetes should test their urine for ketones when they are ill, especially if they have ''vomiting'' and ''nausea''. ''Pregnant'' women with type 1 diabetes may also be advised to test their urine for ketones. Ketone testing is also done when the blood sugar is noted to be very high (over about 240 mg/dL). Your doctor can advise you specifically about recommended testing practices for your individual situation. Sometimes, people with ''type 2 diabetes'' may be advised to check their urine for ketones. Those with type 2 diabetes should discuss with their doctor whether ketone testing is necessary and under what circumstances.''The microalbumin test is done once per year starting at the time of diagnosis in people with type 2 diabetes. Even though protein in the urine is a sign of long-term damage to the kidneys, many people have type 2 diabetes without knowing it, so it is unclear how long they have had the condition. In people with type 1 diabetes, the microalbumin test may not be performed until the condition has been present for up to 5 years.' "

What is a diabetic diet?,"'A diabetes meal plan (diabetes diet) is a nutritional guide for people with diabetes that helps them decide when to consume meals and snacks as well as what type of foods to eat. There is no one predetermined diabetes diet that works for all people with diabetes. The goal of any diabetic meal plan is to achieve and maintain good control over the disease, including control of blood glucose and blood ''lipid'' levels as well as to maintaining a healthy weight andgood ''nutrition''.''Health care professionals and nutritionists can offer advice to help you create the best meal plan to manage your diabetes. Nutritionists can help you find ''recipes'' and ''cooking tips'' to help with meal planning and preparation.' "
Are there diabetic diet guidelines?,"'There is no single diabetic diet that is appropriate for all people with type 2, gestational, or ''type 1 diabetes'' just as there is no single medication regimen that is appropriate for everyone with this disease. Dietary choices depends upon many factors including your age and gender, overall ''exercise'' and activity level, any medications you may be taking (including ''insulin'' or others), and whether or not you are trying to ''lose weight'', among other factors.''Some meal planning tools and guidelines include: ''Most doctors and health care professionals agree that patients with diabetes can eat most of the same foods and meals as the rest of the family with some added attention to timing of meals and portion sizes. As in any healthy diet, it is best to consume a variety of foods. There are numerous recipes and apps if you need ideas for healthy foods to eat.''Healthy eating includes eating a wide variety of foods including:''One example of a diabetic meal plan for people who also have elevated ''cholesterol levels'' is known as the TLC (Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes) plan. This meal plan is designed to help you manage your disease and by lowering your cholesterol level and helping you lose weight. The TLC diet is defined as follows:' The plate method (MyPlate) Glycemic index Counting carbohydrates  Vegetables Whole grains Fruits Non-fat dairy products Beans Lean meats, poultry, and fish Limit fat to 25%-35% of total daily 
calories, getting no more than 7% of your daily calories from saturated fat, 10% 
or less from
	polyunsaturated fats, and up to 20% from monounsaturated fats (like 
plant oils or nuts). Carbohydrates should account for no more than 50%-60% of 
your daily calories. Try to eat 20-30 grams of fiber each 
day. Allow 15%-20% of your daily calories 
for protein. Limit cholesterol to 200 milligrams 
per day."
"How many carbs, fats, and proteins can I eat on a healthy diabetic meal plan?","'The number of carbohydrates (carbs), fats, and proteins in your plan will depend upon the ideal number of calories you should consume each day. Your age, gender, the amount of exercise you get, and your activity level affect the number of calories you need to eat in order to gain, lose, or maintain a healthy weight.''A high-fiber diet has been shown to improve blood sugar and cholesterol levels in people with ''type 2 diabetes''. Fiber can be found in many foods, especially whole grains, beans, vegetables, nuts, and fruits. ' "
Can I have sugar on a diabetic meal plan?,"'Most doctors and other medical or health care professional believe that people on a diabetic diet can have small amounts of sugar, so long as they are part of a healthy and balanced ''nutrition'' strategy. Table sugar does not raise blood glucose more than starches.' "
Can I have alcohol on a diabetic diet?,"'It may be OK for some people with diabetes to drink alcohol in moderation. It is best to drink alcohol when your blood sugar levels are under good control, and it is important to remember that wine and mixed ''drinks'' contain sugar, and alcohol has a lot of calories. Your doctor or health care professional can tell you if alcohol can be a safe part of your meal plan.' "
What foods raise blood sugar levels?,"'The extent to which carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels is known as their glycemic index. ''High glycemic index foods'' raise glucose levels faster and to a greater degree than ''low glycemic index foods''. ''High glycemic index foods include:' White bread, bagels Short-grain white rice Corn flakes or puffed rice cereal  Russet potatoes Saltine crackers, pretzels, rice cakes Pumpkin Melons Pineapple Popcorn"
What foods help maintain good blood sugar levels?,"'These foods can fill you up without dramatic rises in blood glucose levels, for example:''Proteins and fiber can also help you feel full without raising blood sugar levels as much as carbohydrates.' 100% stone-ground whole wheat or 
pumpernickel bread  Rolled or steel-cut oatmeal Converted rice, barley, bulgur  Sweet potato, corn, yam, lima/butter 
beans, peas, legumes and lentils  Many fruits Non-starchy vegetables (these contain fewer carbohydrates than starchy 
	vegetables)"
What is type 2 diabetes?,"'Type 2 diabetes'' occurs over time, and involves problems getting enough sugar (glucose) into the cells of the body. (The cells use the sugar for fuel/energy.)' Sugar (glucose) is the preferred fuel for muscle and brain cells, but it requires insulin to transport it into cells for use. When insulin levels are low, and the sugar can't get into the cells where it is supposed to be, it leads to elevated blood sugar levels. Over time, the cells develop resistance to insulin (insulin resistance), which then requires the pancreas to make more and more insulin to move sugar into the cells; however, more sugar is still left in the blood. The pancreas eventually ""wears out,"" and can no longer secrete enough insulin to move the sugar into the cells for energy."
Which types of foods are recommended for a type 2 diabetes diet?,"'A ''diabetes'' meal plan can follow a number of different patterns and have a variable ratio of ''fats, proteins, and carbohydrates''.'   The carbohydrates consumed should be low glycemic load and come primarily from vegetables. The fat and proteins consumed should primarily come from plant sources."
What is the glycemic index? Which type of carbohydrates should be included?,"'Carbohydrates (carbs) are the primary food that raises blood sugar. ''Glycemic index'' and glycemic load are scientific terms used to measure the impact of a carbohydrate on blood sugar.''Carbohydrates can be classified as either''1. Complex carbohydrates'' (''low glycemic load foods'', or foods that are a part of a type 2 diabetes low-carb diet plan) are in their whole food form and include additional nutrients such as:''These additional nutrients slow down the absorption of the glucose and keep blood sugar levels more stable.''Examples of complex carbohydrates, or low glycemic load (index) foods include:''Whole grains, such as brown rice, quinoa, and oatmeal are good sources of fiber and nutrients; and ''have a low glycemic load making them good food choices''. Processed food labels make it very confusing to understand whole grains. For example, ""whole wheat bread"" is made in many different ways, and some are not that different from white bread in its blood sugar impact (glycemic load). The same is true for whole grain pasta, it\'s still pasta. Whole grains have less of an impact on blood sugar because of the lower glycemic load. Choose whole grains that are still in their grain form like brown rice and quinoa, or look at the fiber content on the ''nutrition'' label. For example, a ""good"" whole grain high-fiber bread will have 3+ grams of fiber per slice.''Starchy vegetables that are good sources of nutrients like ''vitamin C'', and that are higher in carbohydrates than green vegetables, but lower in carbs than refined grains. They can be eaten in moderation. Starchy vegetables include:''The above starchy vegetables are best eaten in smaller portions (1 cup) as part of a combination meal that includes protein and plant-based fat.''Non-starchy vegetables, such as green vegetables, can be eaten in abundance. These foods have limited impact on blood sugar, and also have many health benefits, so eat up! Almost everyone can eat more vegetables - we need at least five servings a day.''Fresh vegetables are a great option, and usually the tastiest option. Studies show that frozen veggies have just as many ''vitamins'"" and nutrients because they are often frozen within hours of harvesting. Just check to make sure there aren't added fats or sweeteners in the sauces that are on some frozen veggies. If you don't like vegetables on their own, try preparing them with fresh or dried herbs, olive oil, or a vinaigrette dressing. Aiming to consume a rainbow of colors through your vegetables is a good way to get all of your nutrients.""'2. Simple carbohydrates ''(''high glycemic load foods, ''or foods that are not part of a type 2 ''diabetes diet'' plan because they raise blood sugar levels) are processed foods, and don\'t contain other nutrients to slow down sugar absorption and thus these foods can raise blood sugar dangerously fast. Many simple carbohydrates that are off-limits are easily recognized as ""white foods.""''Simple carbohydrates or ''high glycemic index foods'' that should ''not be included in your diet'', for example::'   Foods with low glycemic load (index) raise blood sugar modestly and thus are better choices for people with diabetes. The main factors that determine a food's (or meal's) glycemic load are the amount of fiber, fat, and protein it contains. The difference between glycemic index and glycemic load is that glycemic index is a standardized measurement and glycemic load accounts for a real-life portion size. For example, the glycemic index of a bowl of peas is 68 (per 100 grams) but its glycemic load is just 16 (lower the better). If you just referred to the glycemic index, you'd think peas were a bad choice, but in reality, you wouldn't eat 100 grams of peas. With a normal portion size, peas have a healthy glycemic load as well as being an excellent source of protein. complex carbohydrates, or simple sugars. Fiber Vitamins Smaller amounts of proteins and fats Brown rice Whole wheat Quinoa Steel-cut oatmeal Vegetables Fruits Beans Lentils Potatoes Squash Corn Other root vegetables Sugar White pasta White bread Flour Cookies Pastries White potatoes Breakfast cereals Pastries and sweets Fruit juice Pineapples Soft drinks Watermelon"
Which type of fats are recommended?,"'Fats have little direct effect on blood sugar; but, as part of a meal, they are useful in slowing down the absorption of carbohydrates. Fats also have effects on health that are not related to blood sugar. For example:' Animal meat fats increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, dairy, and specifically fermented dairy such as yogurt, appears to decrease this risk. Plant-based fats such as olive oil, nuts, seeds, and avocado are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. Fat also contributes to feelings of satiety and can play a role in managing overeating and carbohydrate cravings. A portion of healthy fats (like avocado on whole grain toast) is much more satisfying and healthy than jam on white toast."
Which types of protein are recommended?,"'Protein provides slow steady energy with relatively little effect on blood sugar. Protein, especially plant-based protein, should always be part of a meal or snack. Protein not only keeps blood sugar stable, but it also helps with sugar cravings and feeling full after eating (satiety). Protein can come from both animal or plant sources; however, animal sources are also often sources of unhealthy saturated fats.''Good protein choices include:''Pay attention to the balance of macronutrients (fat, protein, and carbohydrates) in a meal to support stable blood sugar levels. Specifically, fat, protein, and fiber all slow down the absorption of carbohydrates and thus allow time for a slower, lower insulin release and a steady transport of glucose out of the blood and into the target tissues - this is a good thing.' Beans Legumes Eggs Fish and seafood Organic dairy products Peas Tofu and soy foods Lean meats such as chicken and turkey"
What types of diet or meal plans are recommended for people with type 2 diabetes?,"'Several dietary patterns have been studied, and have shown to have beneficial effects on type 2 diabetes. Because multiple patterns work, people can choose the eating pattern that works best for them. However, there are commonalities among all healthy diabetes diets. ''All healthy diabetes meal plans include:'""People with type 2 diabetes must be extra aware of the carbohydrate content of their meals so their blood sugar levels don't rise, or if they are using injectable insulin, so they can dose insulin appropriately."" a lot of vegetables, and limit processed sugars and red meat."
What are vegetarian or vegan diets?,"'A ''vegetarian'' or ''vegan diet'' can be a good choice for people with diabetes. Vegetarian and vegan diets are typically high in carbohydrates - about 13% higher than a diet with that includes both plant and animal products (omnivorous) – which we generally think is bad for diabetes. However, a vegetarian or vegan diet is typically fiber-rich and lower in calories and saturated fat, so the inflammatory risks associated with high meat consumption are avoided. Research studies that have tested vegetarian and vegan diets for people with diabetes; have found them to be beneficial at reducing blood sugar.''A good quality vegetarian or vegan diet:'   Is high in vegetables and fruits Includes quality proteins such as beans, nuts, and seeds Includes plant-based fats such as olive oil and avocado Prioritizes whole grains such as brown rice and quinoa rather than refined carbohydrates (sweets and processed, packaged white foods)"
What is the ADA diabetes diet?,"'The American Diabetes Association (ADA) advocates for a healthy diet with an emphasis on balancing energy intake with ''exercise''. Historically, they have advocated for the majority of calories coming from complex carbohydrates from whole grains such as whole-grain bread and other whole-grain cereal products and a decreased intake of total fat with most of it coming from unsaturated fat.''Recently, this has shifted to acknowledge that there is no one ideal macronutrient ratio, and that dietary plans should be individualized. ADA guidelines advocate:''However, many people find these guidelines difficult to implement in real-life, and the dietary patterns described below can be easier and more common sense ways for people to manage their eating plan.' Low glycemic load Avoid sugar-sweetened beverages including soda The importance of fat quality as well as quantity"
What is a Paleo Diet?,"'Paleolithic diets include a moderate amount of protein, and have gained a lot of attention recently. The theory behind this dietary pattern is that our genetic background has not evolved to meet our modern lifestyle of calorically dense convenience foods and limited activity, and that returning to a ''hunter''-gatherer way of eating will work better with human physiology. This has been studied in a few small trials, and it does seem beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes.''The Paleolithic diet is based on:''The Paleolithic diet excludes:'""The Paleo Diet doesn't specify macronutrient balance or caloric intake goals.""'In reality, when people in a study followed the Paleolithic diet, it turned out the diet was lower in total energy, energy density, carbohydrates, dietary glycemic load, fiber, saturated fatty acids, and calcium; but higher in unsaturated fatty acids (good fats), dietary ''cholesterol'', and several ''vitamins'' and ''minerals''. Research also demonstrates that people with diabetes are less hungry, have more stable blood sugar, and feel better with lower carbohydrate diets.'  Lean meat Fish, fruit Leafy and cruciferous vegetables Root vegetables Eggs Nuts Dairy products Grains of all kinds Beans Refined fats Sugar Candy Soft drinks Beer Any extra addition of salt"
What is the Mediterranean diet?,"'The ''Mediterranean diet'' is high in vegetables. This refers to the true Mediterranean pattern traditionally followed in the south of Italy and Greece, not ""Americanized Italian,"" which is heavy in pasta and bread. The Mediterranean pattern includes:''This pattern of eating is very nutrient-dense, meaning you get many ''vitamins'', ''minerals'', and other healthful nutrients for every calorie consumed. A very large recent study demonstrated that two versions of the ''Mediterranean diet'' improved diabetes control including better blood sugar and more ''weight loss''. The two versions of the ''Mediterranean diet'' that were studied emphasized either more nuts or more olive oil. Since both were beneficial, a common-sense approach to adopting the Mediterranean diet would include both of these. For example, sprinkle chopped almonds on green beans or drizzle zucchini with olive oil, oregano, and hemp seeds.' Lots of fresh vegetables Some fruit Plant-fats such as olive oil Avocados and nuts Fish such as sardines Some wine Occasional meat and dairy"
Five diabetes superfoods,"'Superfoods'' are foods that benefit your health beyond providing calories or fats, protein, or carbohydrates. Superfoods may be particularly rich in types of vitamins or other nutrients that are uniquely beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes.''Chia is a type of seed that provides fiber, protein, and ''omega-3 fatty acids''. Chia is a superfood because it brings down the glycemic load of any meal, increases hunger satisfaction (satiety), and stabilizes bloods sugar. Adding chia to your breakfast will help keep you full longer. They primary type of fiber in chia is soluble fiber. Soluble fibers turn to a gel when mixed with water. This makes chia seeds excellent to use in baking and cooking when a thickener is needed. Chia mixed with almond milk, cocoa, and a low-glycemic index sweetener like agave or stevia makes an excellent healthy pudding!''Salmon is a type 2 diabetes superfood because salmon is a great source of anti-inflammatory ''omega-3 fatty acids''. There are differences in the fatty acids in wild vs. farmed salmon. This is because of what the fish eat. Wild salmon eat smaller fish and live in colder waters, which causes them to develop a higher ratio of anti-inflammatory omega-3s to saturated fats in their meat. Farmed fish are up to 10 times higher in persistent organic pollutants, antibiotics, and other contaminants. These harmful chemicals are pro-inflammatory and have been associated with increased risk of ''cancer'' and ''heart disease''.''The superfood vinegar is best consumed as vinaigrette dressing on your salad, but it has beneficial effects no matter how you enjoy it. Vinegar slows gastric emptying, which has several beneficial effects for people with type 2 diabetes. This slows the glucose release into the bloodstream, allowing for a small, steady insulin response instead of a large insulin surge. Vinegar also increases satiety, so if you enjoy salad with vinaigrette as your first course, you are less likely to overeat during the main course.''Cinnamon lowers the blood glucose level in people with type 2 diabetes, and it has been well researched and found to be beneficial at doses of about 1 teaspoon/day.''Its high polyphenol content also has added benefit in preventing health complications.''Lentils are a superfood because they contain important vitamins, have great protein, and have lots of fiber. Lentils are rich in:''Lentils have a great balance of protein and complex carbohydrate (high in fiber), and are very versatile to cook with.'   Cinnamon lowers both fasting and postprandial (after meals) blood sugar levels. It is easy to add to any dietary pattern. Cinnamon can be sprinkled on oatmeal. It also is tasty added to coffee! iron, other minerals, and B vitamins such as folate. The green and brown ones stay firm when cooked and are delicious in a salad. The orange ones get soft when cooked, making them well suited in Indian soups, curries, and dal."
Which foods should be avoided in a type 2 diabetes meal plan?,"'People with type 2 diabetes should avoid many of the same unhealthy foods everyone should limit. Dietary restrictions include:''The best way to avoid these foods is to shop around the edges of the grocery store and minimize the number of processed, packaged foods in the middle. Sticking with ""real"" food in its whole, minimally processed form is the best way to eat well for diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes who eat a healthy diet pattern like the ones discussed here reduce the risk of complications that stem from ''high blood sugar'', like cardiovascular disease and ''obesity''.' Sodas: both sugar sweetened regular soda and diet soda raise blood sugar Refined sugars (donuts, pastries, cakes, cookies, scones, sweets, candy) Processed carbs (white bread, pasta, chips, saltines) Trans fats (anything with the word hydrogenated on the label) such as butter ""spreads,"" some mayonnaise ""spreads"" some salad dressings, packaged sauces, bakery goods High-fat animal products (red meat, fatty cuts of pork, bacon, sausage) High-fat dairy products (whole milk, cream, cheese, ice cream) High fructose corn syrup (in soda, candy, packaged convenience food) Artificial sweeteners (in processed foods labeled ""diet"") Highly processed foods – novelty sweets, candies, chips, kettle corn, cookies)"
Can I drink alcohol if I have type 2 diabetes?,"'For most people with type 2 diabetes, the general guideline for moderate ''alcohol'"" consumption applies. Research shows that one drink per day for women and two a day for men reduces cardiovascular risk and doesn't have a negative impact on diabetes. However, alcohol can lower blood sugar, and people with type 2 diabetes who are prone to ""'hypoglycemia'' (such as those using insulin) should be aware of delayed ''hypoglycemia''.''Ways to prevent hypoglycemia include:''It also is important to know that ''hypoglycemia symptoms'' often mimic those of intoxication. ' Eat food with alcoholic drinks to help minimize the risk. Mixed drinks and cocktails often are made with sweeteners or juices, and contain a large amount of carbohydrates so they will increase blood sugar levels. Wear a diabetes alert bracelet so that people know to offer food if you demonstrate hypoglycemic symptoms."
How can I make healthier choices when eating out?,"'It can be challenging to eat out, both because of the unknowns about what exactly a meal will contain in terms of carbs and calories, but also because ''eating out'' with friends or family can often lead to unintentional pressure to eat foods you would be better off without, such as dessert!'   When eating out don't feel shy asking questions about what a dish contains or how it is prepared. Look at menus online before you go. Talk to your friends and family beforehand about your reasons for eating healthy. Tell them it's important to your long-term health that you stay on your healthy eating plan and ask them not to encourage you to eat things that aren't good for you. Friends and family are often just trying to demonstrate their love by wanting you to enjoy a dessert, however mistaken that is. Help them understand they can best help you by not making it more difficult to stay on track and by supporting you in your efforts to take good care of yourself. Share a single dessert with the whole table and limit yourself to two bites. Choose ethnic restaurants such as Thai, sushi, or Indian that have lots of vegetables and fewer refined carbohydrates like pasta and bread. Limit your portion of rice to 1 cup."
What are the complications of type 2 diabetes?,"'Type 2 diabetes can lead to a number of complications such as kidney, nerve, and eye damage, as well as ''heart disease'"". It also means cells are not receiving the glucose they need for healthy functioning. A calculation called a HOMA Score (Homeostatic Model Assessment) can tell doctors the relative proportion of these factors for an individual with type 2 diabetes. Good glycemic control (that is, keeping sugar/carbohydrate intake low so blood sugar isn't high) can prevent long-term complications of type 2 diabetes. A diet for people with type 2 diabetes also is referred to as a ""'diabetic diet'' for type 2 diabetes and medical ''nutrition'' therapy (MNT) for people with diabetes.' "
What is diabetes?,"'\tDiabetes mellitus is a condition in which the body produces no insulin (''type 1 diabetes'') or insufficient insulin (''type 2 diabetes''). Insulin is a chemical (hormone) produced and secreted by the pancreas. Insulin is essential for all parts of the body to properly store and use nutrients (glucose, proteins, and fat). Insulin helps the nutrients to enter the cells of the body. Insulin allows cells to transfer sugar (glucose) from the blood into cells, and this glucose is used to generate the energy necessary to fuel cellular activities. When insulin is absent or ineffective, cells import inadequate amounts of glucose, a starvation process that causes the ''liver'' to release more glucose into the blood in an attempt to feed other tissues. Since this additional glucose still cannot enter the cells, glucose levels in the blood rise. As this glucose-rich blood is filtered by the kidneys, excess sugar enters the urine, accompanied by extra water. High levels of sugar in the blood and urine cause the symptoms and signs of diabetes, such as ''frequent urination'' and excessive ''thirst''.' "
What is the treatment for diabetes?,"'\tThe appropriate treatment for an individual depends on the type of diabetes and its severity. The goal of therapy is to control blood glucose levels, in order to prevent the immediate signs and symptoms of high blood glucose levels (''hyperglycemia''), as well as prevent the long-term complications of ''type 2 diabetes''.''\tType 2 diabetes is managed with a combination of exercise, ''diet'' and medication. It is first treated with weight reduction, diabetic ''diet'', and exercise. When these measures fail to control the elevated blood sugars, oral medications are used. If oral medications are still insufficient, insulin therapy, or other newer injectable therapies are considered.''''Type 1 diabetes'' mellitus requires insulin in addition to exercise, and a diabetic diet.' "
Exercise therapy for diabetes,"'\tRegular ''aerobic exercise'' improves blood circulation and lowers blood glucose levels. Exercise also strengthens the ''heart'' and helps maintain an ideal body weight. The chosen aerobic exercise should use large muscle groups. ''Running'', ''walking'', biking, and ''swimming'"" are excellent activities for most people. The frequency, type, and duration of exercise depend on the individual's age, treatment goals, and physical ability. An exercise program should be designed with the guidance of a health care professional.""'\tExercise usually decreases the blood glucose levels. If blood glucose is low or normal, exercise may cause ''hypoglycemia'' (''low blood glucose'') due to the utilization of glucose by the active muscles. Therefore, food intake and insulin doses should be adjusted based on the intensity and duration of the anticipated exercise.'  "
Diet therapy for diabetes,"'\tProper ''nutrition'' is critical to the management of all forms of diabetes. Some people with type 2 diabetes can control their disease with diet and exercise alone. The right nutrition can help control blood glucose levels, reduce blood ''cholesterol'', maintain optimal body weight, and delay the complications of diabetes. Like exercise, diet therapy is tailored for each person. A successful diet should ideally consider the person’s ethnic background, financial situation, and lifestyle. It also should be simple, since it may be more difficult to follow diet plans with complex rules or food exchanges.''\tPeople with diabetes are often advised to use alternative (artificial) sweeteners. Sweeteners are either nutritive or non - nutritive. Nutritive sweeteners, such as ''sorbitol'' and fructose, provide calories but may not raise blood glucose levels as much as regular sugar. Non-nutritive sweeteners - such as ''sucralose'', ''saccharin'', and ''aspartame'' - do not contain significant calories. Both types of sweeteners are acceptable, but the caloric content of the nutritive sweeteners should be considered when calculating the daily intake of calories. In addition, large quantities of sorbitol can cause ''diarrhea'', and fructose contributes to some diabetic complications.' "
Diabetes and drug therapy,"""\tMedications to treat diabetes are available only by prescription. Insulin must be given by injection or infusion beneath the skin. Oral medications are available that increase the release of insulin from the pancreas and/or increase the responsiveness of the body's cells to the insulin naturally produced by patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients with type 1 diabetes have stopped making insulin and thus must take insulin.""  "
How is diabetic treatment monitored at home?,"'\tThe goal of diabetic therapy is to control blood glucose levels and prevent diabetic complications. Glucose levels are lowered into a normal range, if possible, but it is important not to reduce the levels to abnormally low levels that can cause ''symptoms of hypoglycemia'' such as ''sweating'', increased heart rate, and even ''loss of consciousness''. Therefore, it is necessary not only to treat the diabetes, but also to monitor the effects of treatment on blood glucose levels to avoid overtreatment or undertreatment of diabetes.''\tThere are two types of tests for blood glucose monitoring in the home. The first type uses a reagent strip, and the second type uses a reagent strip and a glucose meter.''\tGlucose and ketones also can be measured in the urine. Ketoacidosis is a serious but preventable complication caused by inadequate treatment of diabetes. This condition can be identified by testing urine for ketones.'  "
Blood glucose reagent strips,"'\tReagent strips are saturated with glucose oxidase, an enzyme that interacts with glucose. When a drop of blood is placed on the strip, the glucose oxidase chemically reacts with the blood glucose. The resultant reaction changes the color of the strip. The higher the glucose level, the greater the reaction, so the more dramatic the color change. The blood glucose level can be determined by comparing the color of the strip with a color chart. For accurate results, test strips should be stored at room temperature and away from moisture. To protect the strips from moisture, bottles should be closed after use.''\tThe disadvantage of reagent strips alone is that they do not give an exact glucose measurement. They are accurate enough, however, to alert patients to seriously high or low levels of glucose. Examples of reagent strips available over–the–counter (OTC) are Chemstrip bG® and Glucostix®. To determine a more accurate blood glucose level, the reagent strip must be combined with a blood glucose meter. (See below.)' "
Blood glucose meters,"""\tSelf-monitoring of blood glucose is the most important tool available to a patient for determining their glycemic control. This test is simple to perform. It involves taking a small lancet to poke a finger. Usually, this testing is performed just off to the side of the finger's tip, although some meters do allow testing at other sites, such as the forearm. Then, a small quantity of blood is placed on a testing strip that has been inserted into a meter that reports the glucose value.""'The meter determines the blood glucose level by measuring the chemical reaction on the reagent strip. Results obtained using a glucose meter are more accurate than those obtained without the meter (that is, with reagent strips alone). However, the results using a home meter vary as much as 20% from the more accurate measurements in a hospital or clinical laboratory. Fortunately, portable meters are accurate enough for home monitoring and self-adjustment of insulin doses at home.''\tIt is important to know that reagent strips are calibrated for specific meters. Many meters need to be calibrated each time a new box of test strips is used. Inappropriate calibration will lead to errors in glucose readings. Using incompatible strips and meters will give unreliable glucose readings.''\tErrors can also be caused when:''The main advantage of self-monitoring blood glucose is its immediate feedback. The immediacy of the result allows the individual to make decisions in terms of insulin, diet, and exercise that immediately improve glucose control. This, in turn, gives people more control over their diabetes and allows them to adapt their ''diabetes treatment'' plan to their lifestyle. Providing regular results to a health care professional allows for more frequent and therapeutic adjustments of medications. This improves symptoms and diabetic control, especially in the outpatient setting.''\tThe main disadvantages of the self-monitoring of blood glucose are cost, discomfort, and inconvenience (such as interrupting one\'s usual activities to do it). In addition, some patients experience a feeling of frustration at seeing high blood glucose results when they expected lower readings. \tOne could say, ""The thing about blood testing is that I know what my sugar is, and the bad thing about glucose testing is that I know what my sugar is.""''\tThe information obtained from self-monitoring blood glucose is valuable to all people with diabetes, even those controlled with diet and exercise, and those who require oral medication. Many physicians routinely give all their patients with diabetes a glucose meter, along with an individualized testing schedule. This \tschedule ranges from once daily up to six times each day, depending on patient needs. Introducing the self-monitoring of blood glucose \tis effective, in conjunction with diet education.''\tMany meters are available on the market and differ in attributes. They vary in the amount of blood used, speed to display results, font size of the display, ability to store readings in memory, and capability to download data. Some meters no longer require calibration. Newer meters function as a portable digital assistant (PDA) for health, allowing patients to enter other laboratory values, dates, and results of health visits. Newer meters may also store the strips right in the meter, thereby allowing the patient to avoid handling the strips. They may also allow for a patient to flag readings \ttaken after eating vs. before a meal. Examples of glucose meters available ''over-the-counter'' are Accu-Chek III®, Glucometer Elite XL®®, and One Touch Ultra.''\tSoftware programs and mobile applications are also available that can help people with diabetes manage their glycemic control. Depending upon the program, users can store and chart glucose levels, lab values, doctor visits, or other health parameters.' 
		meters are improperly calibrated; 
		the meter is dirty; 
		the battery in the meter is dead; 
		reagent strips are stored improperly; 
		the reagent strips have expired; 
		not enough blood is applied to the reagent strip; 
		blood is not left on the reagent strip long enough, or is left too long, before reading; 
		the test is performed under the wrong conditions of temperature and humidity; or 
		patients are dehydrated."
Urine glucose tests,"'\tThe role for testing urinary glucose at home has faded with universal blood \tglucose monitoring by fingerstick. Those few patients who choose to test urinary glucose must realize its limitations. Urinary glucose only estimates blood glucose values roughly, and it provides no information at all unless there is glucose in the urine. Glucose appears in the urine when the blood glucose level is over 180 mg/dL, well above the target for most patients. Below that level, urinary glucose is usually negative.'""\tUrinary glucose levels should not be confused with checking urinary microalbumin and \trelated protein levels. Urinary glucose levels should not be confused with checking urinary microalbumin and related protein levels. Performed in the doctor's office at least annually, these tests provide necessary information about kidney function the basis for determining whether certain medications should be added to the treatment plan to protect kidney function.""'\tUrinary glucose tests also do not indicate the current blood glucose level, but rather the glucose level during the period of time between the collection of the urine and the previous urination. In many patients, the level of blood glucose must be very high in order for glucose to appear in the urine. Therefore, the urine may be free of glucose, despite unacceptably high blood levels of glucose. Thus, results from urine glucose tests should not be used to adjust insulin doses.''\tThere are two types of urine glucose tests. Both types rely on a chemical reaction that produces a color change. These tests use either tablets or strips. Generally, the test strip or tablet is placed in urine. The resulting color change is matched against a color chart provided by the manufacturer, which shows the different colors produced by different levels of glucose.''\tThe first type, called the ''copper reduction test'"", uses cupric sulfate (for example, Clinitest). In the presence of glucose, cupric sulfate (which is blue) changes to cuprous oxide (green to orange). The reaction should be observed closely and the manufacturer's instructions closely followed. The copper reduction tests can react with substances other than glucose in the urine, leading to false positive results. This means the test erroneously shows glucose when it is not present. Examples of these other substances include ""'aspirin'', ''penicillin'', ''isoniazid'' (Nydrazid, Laniazid), ''vitamin C'', and cephalosporin-type antibiotics. Tablets and solutions utilizing copper reduction may damage the skin and are poisonous if ingested. They should be handled carefully and kept out of the reach of children.''\tThe second type of urine glucose test, called the ''glucose oxidase test'', uses the chemical toluidine and the enzyme glucose oxidase (for example, Clinistix). Glucose oxidase converts the glucose in urine to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The interaction of the hydrogen peroxide with the toluidine causes a change in color. False negative results (meaning the test shows no glucose when glucose really is present) may occur in patients taking vitamin C, aspirin, ''iron supplements'', levodopa (''Sinemet''), and \t''tetracycline''-type antibiotics. Glucose oxidase tests are more convenient to use and less expensive than copper reduction tests. The strips should be kept away from moisture.' "
Tests for urinary ketones,"'\tKetone testing is an important part of monitoring type 1 diabetes. It is a tool that is often also used in ''pregnancies'' that are complicated by diabetes (called ''gestational diabetes'').''\tKetones form when one fasts (for example, while sleeping overnight) or when there is a profound lack of insulin. When the body produces insufficient insulin, its cells cannot adequately remove glucose from the blood, and the level of glucose in the blood rises. Responding to what appears to be a lack of glucose, cells release hormones to stimulate the body to produce larger amounts of glucose. Rising blood glucose level causes more urination and ''dehydration''. Due to low insulin action, the liver produces ketones, which are acids released into the blood. The presence of ketones signals a condition in diabetic patients called diabetic ketoacidosis (or DKA). Ketoacidosis always signifies that the cells are not receiving enough insulin.''\tSevere DKA is a medical emergency, since it can result in loss of consciousness and even death. About 0.1% of those with DKA die as a result of it. There is a correlation between high blood glucose levels, ''dehydration'', and ketones. The higher the glucose level, the more likely that ketones will be made. Therefore, diabetic patients with any blood glucose level over 240 mg/dL should test promptly for urinary ketones. Patients with type 1 diabetes should also test for ketones during any acute illness and during severe ''stress''. Also, urinary ketones should be checked if any symptoms of DKA occur (such as ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''abdominal pain'', or increased thirst).''\tKetones can normally be found in the urine. For example, after an overnight fast, ketones can be seen in up to 30% of people without diabetes. However, these levels of ketone production are usually below the threshold of measurement by the ketone test strips. The strips can give falsely positive results when patients are on ''drugs'' such as ''captopril'' (''Capoten''). Falsely negative readings may be seen when test strips are old, exposed to air, or if the urine is very acidic (for example, after drinking a lot of orange juice, which is also high in vitamin C).''\tThese tests are based on the color change that occurs when ketones react with sodium nitroprusside or similar compounds. The tests are performed in a manner similar to that of urinary glucose testing. Different tests detect the three types of ketones (named acetoacetic acid, acetone, and ß-hydroxybutyric acid). For example, Acetest only detects acetoacetic acid and acetone, but not ß-hydroxybutyric acid. Ketostix detects only acetoacetic acid, which can produce false-negative results if only acetone and ß-hydroxybutyric acid are present in the urine. Ketone tests are supplied as strips or tablets.''\tThe American Diabetes Association advises that ketone testing materials be available in the office setting and that physicians should prefer using blood ketone measurements over urine ketone measurements if possible. Home testing for blood ketones is also available, though not often used due to higher cost of the test strips.' "
Blood glucose,"""The American Diabetes Association has the set the recommendations for health care professionals on what they should be doing, and what should be available for the optimal care of patients with diabetes.  Among these recommendations are occasional monitoring of blood glucose either by fingerstick or through a venipuncture (for clinical laboratory testing).  Such assessment can be used to supplement the information obtained from the patient's home glucose monitoring, or to verify portable meter testing in the office.  Office testing allows the health care professional to see if the patient's results at home are accurate."" "
Continuous glucose sensors (CGMS),"'The Food and Drug Administration has approved clinical use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Sensors (CGMS). The first generation of these devices functioned like a Holter monitor of the heart. Now, a small cannula is inserted into the superficial tissue of the abdomen (the subcutaneous tissue). The introducing needle is removed, leaving the sensor to be taped in place then connected to an external device about the size of a digital pager. This records glucose values at an interval of roughly 5 minutes over a 72-hour period. At the end of that period, the recorded glucose values are downloaded, and information is reviewed with a health care professional. Patients usually keep a log over the 72-hour period of how they feel, what they eat, and what their fingerstick readings are for comparison with the sensor data. These data are especially helpful for athletes, patients with unpredictably high or low blood sugar levels, and those who cannot find a pattern to their fingerstick glucose readings. The drawback to the original sensors was that the data were not available in a ""real time"" format. As a result, the patient would have to bring the device into the health care professional\'s office to download and review the data in conjunction with the logs they were keeping.''CGM systems have improved dramatically in the last few years. They represent useful tools for diabetic patients to gain insight into their patterns of glucose response and to tailor more individual treatment regimens. The newest generation sensors provide a real time glucose value to the patient. The implantable sensor communicates wirelessly with a pager-sized device that has a screen. The device is kept near the sensor to allow for transfer of data; however, it can be a few ''feet'' away and still receive transmitted information. Depending on the model, the screen displays the blood glucose reading, a thread of the readings over time, and a potential rate of change in the glucose values. These sensors can be programmed to ""beep"" if blood sugars are in a range that is selected as too high or too low. Some can provide a warning alert if the drop in blood sugar is occurring too quickly.''Recent developments have produced one new sensor designed to communicate directly with the ''insulin pump''. While the pump does not yet respond directly to information from the sensor, it does ""request"" a response from the person wearing the sensor if there is a need to adjust insulin, according to the sugar patterns which the sensor has been programmed to detect. The ultimate goal of this technology is to ""close the loop"" by continuously sensing what the body needs, then responding by providing the appropriate dose of insulin. While this technology needs further development, strides in this direction continue to be significant and encouraging. There is now one sensor that communicates with a pump to have it suspend insulin infusion for 2 hours, if there is a downward trend in blood glucose that could lead to hypoglycemia.' "
Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) testing,"'The ''hemoglobin A1c test'' (HbA1c) is crucial to monitor blood glucose control in patients with diabetes. In brief, ''hemoglobin'' A1c is the final product of several chemical reactions that occur in the bloodstream as ''red blood cells'' are exposed to glucose. A red blood cell typically lives for about three months, so the HbA1c reading provides a report card averaging blood sugar levels over the prior three months. Many different methods are available to determine the HbA1c level. Regardless, HbA1c level has been shown to predict the risk for developing complications of diabetes, much in the same way that ''cholesterol levels'' are predictive of ''heart disease''. The HbA1c test should be performed routinely at three-month intervals in patients with established diabetes. HbA1c can be tested when a new case of adult diabetes is suspected, although its use to diagnose borderline pediatric diabetes is still controversial.''To measure HbA1c, blood obtained in the usual way (from a vein) can be sent to a laboratory. Alternatively, many clinics specialized in diabetes care now have desktop HbA1c machines, which will read a simpler fingerstick blood sample within minutes. Several conditions can affect HbA1c measurements, and most relate to disorders of the red blood cells. For example, results may be falsely low if too few ''red cells'' are present (''anemia''). Falsely low readings can occur when red blood cells lose their proper shape (due to conditions like thalassemias, ''sickle cell disease'', or spherocytosis). HbA1c is invaluable as a tool to individualize patient care plans so that glycemic goals can be achieved.' "
What is diabetic ketoacidosis?,"'Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a severe and life-threatening complication of ''diabetes''. Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs when the cells in our body do not receive the ''sugar'' (glucose) they need for energy. This happens while there is plenty of glucose in the bloodstream, but not enough insulin to help convert glucose for use in the cells. The body recognizes this and starts breaking down muscle and fat for energy. This breakdown produces ketones (also called fatty acids), which cause an imbalance in our ''electrolyte'' system leading to the ketoacidosis (a metabolic acidosis). The sugar that cannot be used because of the lack of insulin stays in the bloodstream (rather than going into the cell and provide energy). The kidneys filter some of the glucose (sugar) and excrete it in the urine.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis?,"'Typical signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include:'   Dry skin and mouth Abdominal Pain Decreased level of consciousness (anything from drowsiness and confusion to unconsciousness) Frequent urination Fruity smelling breath Shortness of breath Deep, rapid breathing (sometimes referred to as Kussmaul breathing) Nausea and vomiting Dehydration"
What causes diabetic ketoacidosis?,"'In general diabetic ketoacidosis occurs because there is not enough insulin to move sugar (glucose) into the cell where it can be used for energy. Besides lack of insulin, certain body stressors combined with ''diabetes'', such as infection or illness, can trigger diabetic ketoacidosis.''Sometimes diabetic ketoacidosis is the first sign of ''diabetes'' in people who are not aware they have ''diabetes''. (They have not previously diagnosed with ''diabetes''.)' "
Who is at risk for developing diabetic ketoacidosis?,"'People with ''type 1 diabetes'' who are not taking their insulin or are getting ill with an infection or other disease are at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis.''Usually it occurs in people who have ''type 1 diabetes'' that are at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis. Although it is rare in people with ''type 2 diabetes'', it can occur.' "
What are the complications of diabetic ketoacidosis?,'Because many people who develop into diabetic ketoacidosis have multiple underlying illnesses (besides ''diabetes'') diabetic ketoacidosis can lead to significant complications and death. ''Cardiac arrest'' and ''kidney failure'' are all known complications.''The lifesaving treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis also can lead to the following complications:'  Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) Cerebral Edema (swelling of brain) Low potassium (hypokalemia).
How is diabetic ketoacidosis diagnosed?,"""Diabetic ketoacidosis is diagnosed using blood and urine tests, patient history, and physical exam. The typical signs and symptoms along with a history might suggest the diagnosis. A combination of elevated blood glucose level, ketones detected in the blood or urine and a lower than normal pH level of the blood (indicating acidosis) usually establish the diagnosis. Other blood tests also are ordered to assess the patient's overall status, for example, to check the patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium.""""Upon physical exam the patient's pulse rate is often elevated and the ""'blood pressure'' lower than normal. The patient may be confused and often will be dehydrated.''If your doctor thinks an infection is present, other tests might be added (''chest X-ray'', blood cultures).' "
What are the treatment guidelines for diabetic ketoacidosis?,"'Diabetic ketoacidosis needs to be treated with several approaches at the same time. The aim is to normalize blood pH, while slowly lowering blood sugar levels, and normalizing all of the ''electrolytes''. This usually accomplished by giving insulin to the patient as well as electrolyte fluids (such as Normal Saline).''Diabetic ketoacidosis can cause abnormal electrolyte (especially potassium) levels requiring close monitoring of those levels and usually replacing deficient ''electrolytes''. One of the complications of the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis is a severe fluctuation in potassium levels.''To reverse ''dehydration'' IV fluids are given to the patient to replace the fluid loss. The composition of the IV fluids and speed with which it is infused are important aspects of the care of the patient with diabetic ketoacidosis.'""Any underlying illness that may have caused the patient's diabetic ketoacidosis also will be treated such as:""""Supportive care such as oxygen and the patient's usual medications will often be added.""  Infections Heart attack Other stressors"
How can diabetic ketoacidosis be prevented?," If you have diabetes take all of your medications as prescribed by your health-care professional. Learn to recognize the symptoms of elevated blood glucose levels. Don't skip insulin doses (an important factor in prevention). Test your glucose levels regularly as recommended by your doctor. Test your urine at home, especially when you feel ill. This will help detect ketones or elevated sugar in the blood, which should alert you to the possibility of diabetic ketoacidosis. Make an appointment with your health-care professional when you feel sick or if your sugar or ketone levels are higher than normal to prevent further worsening or development of diabetic ketoacidosis."
Can you die from diabetic ketoacidosis?,"'Diabetic ketoacidosis has a high mortality (death rate) and risk of complications. The prognosis depends on how quickly it is recognized, the underlying medical conditions of the individual, and the underlying precipitating causes of the diabetic ketoacidosis.' "
Which type of doctors treat diabetic ketoacidosis?,"'Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis usually needs to be treated at the hospital. The person will receive treatment at first by an ''emergency medicine'"" specialist and once admitted to the hospital by an internist, family medicine specialist or intensivist. Endocrinologists are physicians specializing in the endocrine system and diabetes, and often will be involved in the patient's medical care."" "
What is diabetic neuropathy?,"'Neuropathy is damage to nerves, and diabetic neuropathy is damage to nerves that occurs as a result of diabetes. Diabetes is thought to damage nerves as a result of prolonged elevated levels of blood glucose. Diabetic neuropathy can affect different parts of the body, and symptoms can range from mild to severe. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of diabetic neuropathy?,"'The symptoms and signs of diabetic neuropathy depend upon the type of neuropathy that is present. Signs and symptoms can also vary in severity among affected people.''The symptoms can appear suddenly. It usually does not cause a long term problem, and symptoms often improve over weeks to months. Symptoms can include:'   Numbness or tingling of the feet and lower legs Pain or burning sensations Loss of sensation in the feet or lower legs Sometimes, but less commonly, these symptoms can occur in the hands or arms Pain, usually on one side, in the hips, buttocks, or thighs Weakness of the legs Nausea and/or vomiting Diarrhea Constipation Dizziness Fainting Feeling full after eating a small amount Erectile dysfunction in men Incontinence of urine Inability to empty the bladder completely Decrease in vaginal lubrication in women Profuse sweating, for example when eating or at night Bloating Difficulty swallowing Low blood pressure upon standing up suddenly (orthostatic hypotension) Rapid resting heartbeat Chest pain Eye pain Changes in vision Bell's palsy (paralysis on one side of the face) Pain in a localized area of the body"
What causes diabetic neuropathy?,"'The cause of nerve damage in diabetes is not well understood. Long-term exposure to high levels of blood glucose is able to damage nerve tissue, although the reason for this damage is unclear.' "
Can diabetic neuropathy be reversed?,"'Nerve damage typically cannot be reversed once it has occurred. However, there are medications and self-care measures that can help control the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.' "
What are the types of diabetic neuropathy?,"'There are different types of diabetic neuropathy. The distinction depends upon which types and location of nerves are affected.'   Diabetic peripheral neuropathy refers to damage to peripheral nerves, most commonly the nerves of the feet and legs. Diabetic proximal neuropathy affects nerves in the thighs, hips, or buttocks. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy affects the autonomic nervous system, the nerves that control body functions. For example, it can affect nerves of the gastrointestinal, urinary, genital, or vascular systems. Diabetic focal neuropathy affects a specific nerve or area at any site in the body."
How is diabetic neuropathy diagnosed?,"""Diabetic neuropathy is usually presumptively diagnosed clinically by the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical exam. However, there are other tests that can definitively diagnose the condition by actually measuring the loss of nerve function. Nerve conduction studies measure the speed of nerve signals in the arms and legs, while electromyography measures the electrical discharges produced in muscles. Other tests of nervous system function may be done on some patients. About 45% to 50% of all patients with diabetes are eventually diagnosed with some form of neuropathy."" "
What are treatments for diabetic neuropathy?,"'While diabetic neuropathy cannot be cured, there are treatments available to help manage some of the symptoms. Another treatment goal is keeping blood glucose levels under good control through a combination of ''diet'' and medication so that the neuropathy does not worsen. Keeping blood glucose levels under control has been shown to improve symptoms and prevent worsening of the pain.'  "
What natural home remedies help relieve pain?,"'There are a number of self- and home care measures that you can take to relieve the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. Examples are:'   Using a device known as a bed cradle to keep bedcovers off of sensitive feet and lower legs Using heat or cold patches, but since diabetic neuropathy can damage sensory nerves, care should be taken to avoid burns or freezing Eating small, frequent meals and avoiding fatty foods may help those with digestive symptoms Standing up slowly or wearing elastic compression stockings can improve orthostatic hypotension Exercises, stretching, or massage may help relieve pain"
What medications help relieve the pain from diabetic neuropathy?,"'The pain of diabetic neuropathy can sometimes be managed with certain medications. Certain prescription ''antidepressants'' and antiseizure medications have been shown to be effective in relieving pain that originates in the nerves.''For example:''In severe cases, opioid analgesic medications may be needed.''Medications can also help manage the troublesome symptoms of autonomic neuropathy. For example, antispasmodic or anticholinergic drugs can help prevent urinary ''incontinence''. Drugs to treat ''erectile dysfunction'' like ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra''), ''tadalafil'' (''Cialis''), and ''vardenafil'' (''Levitra'') may help some men with ''ED'' due to diabetic neuropathy. For women, vaginal estrogen creams and lubricants may provide relief of ''vaginal dryness'' and irritation.' duloxetine (Cymbalta) is an antidepressant that can relieve the pain of diabetic neuropathy in some people. The tricyclic antidepressant drugs, including nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl) and desipramine (Norpramin), have also been used for this purpose. Anti-seizure drugs such as gabapentin (Neurontin), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and pregabalin (Lyrica) are drugs that can also work to relieve pain in people with diabetic neuropathy."
Can diabetic neuropathy be prevented?,"'Keeping diabetes under control is the best way to prevent or stop the progression of diabetic neuropathy. Your doctor can advise you about the best target range for your blood glucose levels, and keeping tight control of blood ''sugar'' within this range can help prevent neuropathy and other complications of diabetes. Avoiding ''smoking'', getting ''exercise'', and eating a healthy ''diet'' are other measures that can help people with diabetes have the best long-term outcomes.' "
What is dialysis?,"'The kidneys are responsible for filtering waste products from the blood. Dialysis is a procedure that is a substitute for many of the normal functions of the kidneys. The kidneys are two organs located on either side in the back of the abdominal ''cavity''. Dialysis can allow individuals to live productive and useful lives, even though their kidneys no longer work adequately. Statistics from 2015, U.S. Renal Data System Annual Data Report (USRDS), showed approximately 468,000 patients were receiving dialysis in the United States. More than an additional 193,000 patients had a functioning kidney transplant for ''end stage renal disease''.'""Dialysis helps the body by performing the functions of failed kidneys. The kidney has many roles. An essential job of the kidney is to regulate the body's fluid balance. It does this by adjusting the amount of urine that is excreted on a daily basis. On hot days, the body sweats more. Thus, less water needs to be excreted through the kidneys. On ""'cold'"" days, the body sweats less. Thus, urine output needs to be greater in order to maintain the proper balance within the body. It is the kidney's job to regulate fluid balance by adjusting urine output.""'Another major duty of the kidney is to remove the waste products that the body produces throughout the day. As the body functions, cells use energy. The operation of the cells produces waste products that must be removed from the body. When these waste products are not removed adequately, they build up in the body. An elevation of waste products, as measured in the blood, is called ""azotemia."" When waste products accumulate they cause a sick feeling throughout the body called ""''uremia'',"" which is due to urea and other nitrogenous waste compounds.'  "
When do patients require dialysis?,"'When the kidneys fail to filter the blood effectively, and fluid and waste products build up in the body to a critical level a person may need to start dialysis. The two main causes of ''kidney failure'' and need for dialysis treatment are ''diabetes'' and ''high blood pressure''.''When a person’s levels of waste products in their body become so high they start to become sick from them, he or she may need dialysis. The level of the waste products usually builds up slowly. Doctors that specialize in diseases and conditions of the kidneys are called nephrologists. To help nephrologists decide when dialysis is necessary for a patient, he she will order tests that measure several blood chemical levels in the patient’s body. The two major blood chemical levels that are measured are the ""''creatinine'' level"" and the ""blood urea nitrogen"" (BUN) level. As these two levels rise, they are indicators of the decreasing ability of the kidneys to cleanse the body of waste products.''Doctors use a urine test, the ""creatinine clearance,"" to measure the level of kidney function. The patient saves urine in a special container for one full day. The waste products in the urine and in the blood are estimated by measuring the creatinine. By comparing the blood and urine level of this substance, the doctor has an accurate idea of how well the kidneys are working. This result is called the creatinine clearance. Usually, when the creatinine clearance falls to 1 below 10 cc/minute, the patient needs dialysis.'""The doctor also uses other indicators of the patient's status to decide about the need for dialysis. If the patient is experiencing a major inability to rid the body of excess water, or is complaining of problems with the ""'heart'', ''lungs'', or stomach, or difficulties with taste or sensation in their legs, dialysis may be indicated even though the creatinine clearance has not fallen to the 10 cc/minute level.' "
What are the types of dialysis? How do they work?,"'There are two main types of dialysis, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.''Hemodialysis uses an external machine and a special type of filter to remove excess waste products and water from the blood.'""During hemodialysis, blood passes from the patient's body to the ""'dialysis machine'' through sterile tubing and into a filter, called a dialysis membrane. For this procedure, the patient has a specialized vascular tube placed between an artery and a vein in the arm or leg (called a gortex graft). Sometimes, a direct connection is made between an artery and a vein in the arm. This procedure is called a Cimino fistula. Needles are then placed in the graft or fistula, and blood passes to the dialysis machine, through the filter, and back to the patient. If the patient requires dialysis before a graft or a fistula is placed, a large diameter catheter (hemodialysis catheter) is placed directly into a large vein in the neck or leg in order to perform dialysis. In the dialysis machine, a solution on the other side of the filter receives the waste products from the patient.'""Peritoneal dialysis uses a fluid that is placed into the patient's abdominal cavity through a ""'plastic'' tube (peritoneal dialysis catheter) to remove excess waste products and fluid from the body.''Peritoneal dialysis uses the patients own body tissues inside of the belly (abdominal cavity) to act as the filter. The abdominal cavity is lined with a special membrane called the peritoneal membrane. A plastic tube called a peritoneal dialysis catheter is placed through the abdominal wall into the abdominal cavity. A special fluid called dialysate is then flushed into the abdominal cavity and washes around the ''intestines''. The peritoneal membrane acts as a filter between this fluid and the blood stream. By using different types of solutions, waste products and excess water can be removed from the body through this process.' "
Where do I get dialysis treatment? How long does it take? How often do I have to get it?,"'Treatment for hemodialysis usually takes place in a hemodialysis unit. This is a special building that is equipped with machines that perform the dialysis treatment. The dialysis unit is also the place where patients can receive dietary counseling and help with social needs.'""Patients generally go to the dialysis unit three times a week for treatment. For example, the schedule is either Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Before treatment, patients weigh themselves so that excess fluid accumulated since the last dialysis session can be measured. Patients then go to assigned chairs that are like lounge chairs. The area of the graft or fistula (the connection between the artery and vein), is cleaned thoroughly. Two needles are then inserted into the graft or fistula. One takes the blood to the machine where it is cleaned. The other needle allows blood that is returning to the patient to go back into the patient's body.""""Treatments last from 2 ½ to 4 ½ hours. During this time, the dialysis staff checks the patient's ""'blood pressure'' frequently and adjusts the dialysis machine to ensure that the proper amount of fluid is being removed from the patients body. Patients can read, watch television, ''sleep'', or do other work during treatment. On occasion, patients who are very motivated may be able to perform dialysis themselves at home in a process called home hemodialysis.'""Peritoneal dialysis requires the patient to play a more active role in their dialysis treatment. Of primary importance is the patient's responsibility for maintaining a clean surface on the abdomen and catheter, where treatment is administered, in order to prevent infection.""""During this process, the patient weighs herself/himself to determine the strength of fluid to be used. The patient then puts on a mask and cleans the peritoneal catheter site. Fluid that has been allowed to stay in the peritoneal cavity while the peritoneal membrane filters waste into the fluid. The fluid and waste are is then drained back into the plastic bag that originally contained the fluid. The patient then disconnects this bag containing waste in the fluid and connects a new bag of solution that is allowed to drain into the peritoneal cavity. Once the fluid is in the body, the new bag is rolled up and placed in the patient's underwear until the next treatment. This procedure usually takes 30 minutes to accomplish and must be done four to five times a day.""'As an alternative to this treatment, some patients on peritoneal dialysis use a machine called a ""cycler."" This cycler is used every night. Five to six ''bags'' of dialysis fluid are used on the cycler and the machine automatically changes the fluid while the patient sleeps.' "
What are the advantages of the different types of dialysis?,"'Each of the two types of dialysis, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, has advantages and disadvantages. It is up to the patient and their kidney doctor to decide which of these procedures is best by considering her/his life style, other medical conditions, support systems, and how much responsibility and participation in the treatment program he/she desires. The patient must realize that because of their specific medical condition, they may not be a candidate for one or the other type of dialysis. Each patient must view the two types of dialysis procedures from her/his own perspective.''Regardless of which type of dialysis is chosen, patients have certain responsibilities such as following a ''diet'' program, watching their fluid intake, taking special ''vitamins'', and other medicines to control blood pressure and calcium and phosphorus balance.''For many patients, the major advantage of hemodialysis is minimal participation in the treatment. However, patients are required to adhere to a specific schedule and travel to the dialysis unit three times a week. Hemodialysis also requires stricter ''diet'' control and fluid control than peritoneal dialysis.''For those patients preferring more independence, peritoneal dialysis allows for more flexible scheduling and can be performed at home. The patient must undergo a certain amount of dialysis each day, but can alter the exact timing of the dialysis procedure.''A major problem with peritoneal dialysis is infection. The patient has a plastic tube that goes from the peritoneal cavity to the outside of the body and this is a potential site for the entry of bacteria into the body. Great emphasis is placed on cleanliness and technique during the training sessions.' "
What is the life expectancy for someone on dialysis?,"'The expected lifespan of a patient receiving dialysis in the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) report was approximately 8 years for dialysis patients 40 to 44 years of age and approximately 4.5 years for those 60 to 64 years of age. This is a highly variable range that is dependent on many factors such as:''Some patients do dialysis as a ''bridge'' (time to locate an appropriate donor kidney) to getting a kidney transplant (renal transplant). If a patient is successful in getting a transplant and is able to stop dialysis, their survival prognosis increases greatly.' race, age of patient, quality of dialysis treatment, other medical issues in the patient (comorbidities), quality of pre-dialysis treatment, control of potassium levels, and overall compliance of the patient."
How can patients learn more about dialysis?,"'As a patient approaches dialysis, there are numerous sources of information. The doctor often has access to training videos that explain the dialysis techniques and their respective advantages and disadvantages.''Throughout the country are regional units of the ''National Kidney Foundation''. These can be contacted, either through your physician or by contacting local dialysis units.''The National Kidney Foundation''30 East 33rd St.''New York, NY 10016''(800) 622-9010''The ''American Association of Kidney Patients'' is an active association of patients and families involved with dialysis and a very good source of information.''American Association of Kidney Patients''3505 E.

Facts you should know about a diaper rash,"  Diaper rash is very common in babies and is not a sign of parental neglect. Diaper rash is most commonly a kind of contact dermatitis. Diaper rash may become secondarily infected by bacteria or yeast normally present on the skin. In this case, topical antibiotic ointments provide a rapid and effective therapy. Avoidance of skin irritants by frequent diaper changing provides the number-one preventative measure. Effective treatments include frequent diaper changes, application of topical barriers (for example, petroleum jelly), and rarely topical antibiotic/antifungal ointments, or low-potency hydrocortisone cream. High-potency steroid creams, powders, and concentrated baking-soda/boric-acid baths and neomycin-containing ointments are to be avoided."
What is diaper rash?,"'Diaper rash is a generalized term indicating any skin irritation (regardless of cause) that develops in the diaper-covered region. Synonyms include diaper ''dermatitis'' (dermatitis = inflammation of the skin), napkin (or ""nappy"") dermatitis, and ammonia dermatitis. While there are several broad categories of causes of diaper rash, contact irritation is the most common culprit. While diaper rash is generally thought to affect infants and toddlers, any individual wearing a diaper (for example, an ''incontinent'' adult) is a candidate to develop this dermatitis.' "
Is diaper rash a sign of neglectful care?,"'No, not at all. Parents often incorrectly feel that the rash is a visual representation of poor caretaking skills. However, parents need to understand that the basic causes for this common kind of skin irritation are still under active debate in the field of dermatology and that neglectful ''parenting'' is not among the possible factors. In the United States, diaper dermatitis represents about 10%-20% of all skin disorders managed by a general pediatrician. While the rash may develop as early as the first week of life, the most frequent time period is between 9-12 months of age. Studies have indicated that, at any point in time, between 7%-35% of children in this age range are experiencing such a skin rash.' "
What causes diaper rash?,"'There are several categories of causes for this dermatitis. First and foremost is ""irritant"" or ""contact"" dermatitis. Skin involvement may vary from mild redness (similar in character to a ''sunburn'') to erosion of the top layers of skin. A characteristic differential point of contract diaper dermatitis from other causes of diaper rash is that it rarely involves the skin fold ''regions -- therefore,'' it spares areas not in contact with urine/''stool''.''Skin infections compose the next most common category of diaper rash. Bacteria (''staph'' and ''strep'') and yeast/fungal (''Candida'') are common causes of diaper rash. Generally, both of these types of infections tend to result from a disruption of skin integrity and overwhelming the natural defense mechanisms of skin in this diaper region. Staph and ''strep'' ''bacterial infections'' are commonly termed ''impetigo''. Classic descriptions of ''impetigo'' include small (1-2 mm) tiny ''blisters'' (vesicles) and pustules that tend to easily rupture leaving multiple erosions in a sea of generalized skin irritation. ''Candida'' diaper dermatitis also has several distinguishing patterns. The rash is characterized by zones of bright red skin with a series of discrete 2-4 mm ""satellite"" lesions at the borders of the confluent irritated skin. In contrast to contact dermatitis, ''Candida'"" is generally only found in the skin folds' creases and often around the anal region. Infectious causes of diaper dermatitis can generally be diagnosed by visual inspection alone. If ""'confusion'' exists, laboratory studies of swabs of the involved areas may be obtained.''Allergic'' reactions are a less common cause of diaper rash. Commonly proposed allergens are fragrances and components of the diaper and wipes. These regions often have well-defined zones of redness with superficial vesicles and erosions. If the diagnosis of allergic skin reaction is suspect, skin-patch testing may be done to identify the offending agent. This is rarely necessary.''In addition to the common place causes of diaper rash, there are also a few very unusual causes of this problem. Unusual infections, metabolic and nutritional deficiency states, and immunodeficiency states and malignancies can all be implicated. Unfortunately, ''child abuse'' (hot-water immersion, extreme neglect to infant hygiene) can also feature a diaper rash.' "
What are diaper rash symptoms and signs?,"""A diaper rash is a change in the skin enclosed by a child's diaper. Most commonly, the involved skin is red and may or may not have erosion of the superficial skin layers. Pustules or small blisters may be present. If the irritated skin is sensitive, diaper changing may be mildly uncomfortable to the child."" "
How do doctors diagnose the cause of a diaper rash?,"'Most diaper ''rashes'' are a result of skin irritants (urine and/or ''stool'') inflaming immature, vulnerable skin. Such a rash is termed a contact skin irritant rash. Two types of infections may occur independently or be a complication of a contact diaper rash. Staph and strep bacterial skin infections may be associated with pustules or tiny blisters. A ''Candida'' ''yeast infection'' may also develop in the diaper region and around the anal area.' "
What treatments are recommended for diaper rash?,"'The best treatment for diaper rash is avoidance of the precipitating agents which led to the contact irritation and to regions becoming secondarily infected by skin bacteria or yeast. Frequent diaper changes limit stool and urine exposure to the area and remain the foundation for ''prevention'' and management of diaper dermatitis.''Should a rash develop, simple cleansing with water and soft cloths tends to be less irritating to the injured skin than disposable wipes. Frequent application of one of the many diaper-area ointments containing either petroleum jelly (Vaseline) or zinc oxide (''Desitin'') provides an effective barrier against skin irritants and lessens friction to irritated skin. If the diaper rash is especially irritated by the rubbing necessary for proper hygiene, then using a non-sticky cream or ointment (such as Vaseline) as a barrier may be an important consideration. If sticky stool hinders hygiene, it may be more easily removed after application of mineral oil to the area. Most pediatricians find no benefit to using cornstarch or talcum power. The risk of possible aspiration of these powders underscores their general lack of significant efficacy. High-concentration baking soda or boric-acid baths are to be avoided due to possibility of toxicity associated with an increased rate of absorption due to skin breakdown.''Weather and/or carpet permitting, open-air exposure of the irritated skin is also extremely effective in helping clear up diaper rash. Many children have a therapeutic response to merely sitting in a warm-water bath twice daily for 15-20 minutes per session. The value of additional agents (including baking soda) added to the bath water is debatable.''Should these measures not provide a solid response within two to three days, the possibility of a secondary bacterial or ''yeast infection'' must be considered. The diaper region should be examined by a pediatrician unless the parent is confident in correctly making these diagnoses. Several topical antibiotic ointments are available for therapy in these situations.' "
Are there home remedies for a diaper rash?,"'Home remedies for diaper rash include'  air exposure (such as no diaper for short time periods), extra bathing (10-15 minutes in warm water), application of topical barriers to the diaper region. Petroleum jelly (Vaseline) and zinc oxide (Desitin) are often helpful. Powders are not recommended. Neither are high concentrations of baking soda or boric acid baths."
How about not using disposable diapers?,"""Parents often wonder if switching from disposable to cloth diapers will lessen the likelihood of contact type diaper rash. In fact, the opposite seems to be true. The absorbent gel material found in most of today's disposable diapers draws moisture away from the skin area, thus helping to promote a healthy diaper area."" "
How should an allergic rash be treated?,"'For an ''allergic reaction'' to the fragrances or other components found in disposable diapers or wipes, eliminating the offending agents by using either simple water cleansing of the skin and a switch to another brand of disposable diapers or using cloth diapers instead is usually therapeutic.' "
How about using cortisone cream?,"'A minimally concentrated hydrocortisone cream may be recommended in certain cases. However, the excessive usage of minimally concentrated hydrocortisone cream and the use of increased potency hydrocortisone preparations are notorious for causing secondary side effects. They should only be used under the guidance of a pediatrician or another physician who is fully familiar with their application to infants.' "
How about using Neosporin?,"'This ointment (and others containing the topical antibiotic neomycin) should be avoided since neomycin is a very common ''allergen'' promoting an allergic skin reaction. Instead of helping the situation, such a medication may complicate and confuse the situation.' "
What is the prognosis for a diaper rash?,"'The prognosis for diaper ''rashes'' is excellent. The routine therapies above should provide a rapid and effective response. Lack of such an improvement should raise a red flag to have a pediatric evaluation to rule out unusual conditions associated with a diaper rash. Unfortunately, diaper rashes may recur.' "
Is it possible to prevent a diaper rash?,"'Several approaches can help prevent a diaper rash. These include timely changing of soiled diapers, experimentation with alternative diaper brands to address the possibility of a unique sensitivity reaction, air exposure, and extra bathing. It is very important for parents to appreciate that development of a diaper rash is not an indictment of their parenting skills. Rather, it is one of the many challenges of parenthood.' "
What are barrier methods of birth control (contraception)?,"'Barrier methods of contraception work by creating a physical barrier between sperm and egg cells so that fertilization cannot occur. The most common forms of barrier contraception are:''Spermicides, a form of chemical contraceptive that work by killing sperm, are often combined with barrier methods of contraception for greater effectiveness.''Barrier methods of contraception generally do not have the side effects of hormonal contraceptives, and some forms of barrier contraception (contraceptive sponges and condoms) may be obtained without a prescription and easily purchased over the counter at pharmacies.''The only medical contraindication to the use of barrier contraception is ''latex allergy'' (when using latex condoms). However, with the exception of male and female condoms that can provide some protection against infection with sexually-transmitted diseases (''STDs''), most methods of barrier contraception are not effective in preventing STDs.'  condoms (male and female), diaphragm, cervical cap, and contraceptive sponge."
Spermicides,"""During sexual intercourse, hundreds of millions of sperm are normally released into a woman's vagina. The large majority of these sperm die. They die because of the vagina's unfriendly environment, which is acidic, and because the ""'mucus'"" in the cervix above the vagina acts as a selective filter for the sperm. Only about 1% of all the sperm released in an ejaculation successfully pass through the woman's vagina and cervix to reach the uterus (the womb). However, it only takes one sperm to fertilize the ovum (the egg) and to achieve ""'conception''.''Spermicides are a type of contraceptive agent that work by killing sperm.'""Spermicides need to be placed in a woman's vagina prior to intercourse if they are to prevent viable sperm from reaching her uterus. Spermicides come in a wide variety of forms, including jellies, creams, foams, films, and suppositories. The active ingredient in essentially all spermicides is Nonoxynol-9. This is a detergent-like chemical that kills sperm (i.e. spermicidal).""'Once placed inside the vagina, the spermicide melts into a liquid that coats the vagina in order to provide a chemical barrier between the sperm and the cervix. Spermicidal foams are more effective than creams or jellies. Not only is it possible to achieve a better distribution with foam, but foam adheres better to the vaginal walls and cervix.''Suppositories are solid or semi-solid inserts which must be inserted in the vagina 15 minutes before intercourse in order to bind with vaginal moisture and liquefy.''Vaginal contraceptive film needs to be in place in the vagina about 5 minutes prior to sexual intercourse in order to liquefy and become effective.'""Spermicides resemble other methods of birth control in that they must be used properly in order to prevent pregnancy. Each type of spermicide has a unique method of use. For example, spermicidal creams, gels, and foams need to be deposited high up in the vagina near the cervix. Spermicidal suppositories must be unwrapped and inserted in the vagina. Squares of spermicidal film should be inserted into the vagina with the user's finger. It is important to follow the package's exact instructions.""""A spermicide should be placed in the vagina prior to the man's penis entering the vagina. It is a common mistake for a couple to wait too long before using the spermicide.""'There are two basic concerns with any given spermicide. 1) How long the spermicide stays in the desired place; and 2) how long the spermicide is active in killing sperm. Therefore, the timing of spermicide use must take into account both of these factors.''In general, spermicides tend to be effective soon after their application. They can be inserted 15 minutes or more before intercourse. However, if there is a significant delay before intercourse (for example an hour), more spermicide must be added.''A fresh application of spermicide must also be used for each act of intercourse.''Douching'' should be avoided for at least 8 hours after the last intercourse.''The effectiveness of spermicides in preventing pregnancy varies from 70 to 90%. This depends on the amount of spermicide and how it is used, the timing of use prior to intercourse, and how well the instructions on the package are followed.''Spermicides should not be used as protection for the woman or man against sexually transmitted infections (sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs). While spermicides may be partially protective against certain organisms that cause sexually transmitted infections, (e.g. ''Chlamydia'' and ''gonorrhea''), they also do not protect against the ''human Immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'') infection.''The main objection voiced concerning spermicides is that they are ""messy."" A small percent (2% to 4%) of people may have an adverse reaction to Nonoxynol-9, which is experienced as an irritation or a burning sensation within the vagina or on the external genitalia.''Spermicides have some positive features. They are relatively inexpensive and they are available over-the- counter (OTC) without a prescription.''Note that some lubricating jellies available ''over-the-counter'' do not contain spermicide and are not meant to be used as a form of birth control. It is important to check the information on the package to be sure that the product contains spermicide or that the word ""contraceptive"" appears on the label.' "
Male condom,"'Male condoms are far more common than female condoms. A ''male condom'"" is a thin sheath that is worn over the man's penis during sexual intercourse. The ""'condom'' collects sperm so that it is not released into the vagina. Condoms are known as rubbers, sheaths, prophylactics, and many other names.''Condoms are made from a variety of materials including latex, rubber, ''plastic'' polyurethane, and animal tissue. They are also available in a variety of sizes, colors, styles, and thicknesses. They may be dry, lubricated, or treated with a spermicide. Although convenient, a wallet is not the best place to store condoms. Condoms last longer when they are stored under less moist conditions. In general, condoms have a shelf life of about five years if stored unopened in a cool, dry place.'""A condom must be the correct size and fit the man's erect penis properly. There should be 1/2 inch (about 1.25 cm) at the tip of the condom to provide a space for the sperm-filled semen to collect. Some condoms have this feature built in.""'Prior to any contact between the penis and the vagina, the condom is unrolled over the erect penis, ensuring the condom is not turned backwards or inside out. Some condoms come pre-lubricated. If additional lubrication is desired, a water-based product should be used. Spermicides may be used as lubricants with condoms and may thus increase the efficacy of the condom. Oil-based products such as Vaseline, vaginal creams, or mineral oil, may damage the condom and should never be used.''There is an obvious problem of lack of barrier protection if the condom breaks, slips, or comes off the penis. Condoms are quality controlled in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for manufacturing defects that could result in breakage. Condom failure can also be caused by the user and/or his partner. For example, long fingernails or jewelry can tear condoms.''Immediately after ejaculation, the condom should be removed from the vagina. It should be held firmly in place at the base of his penis, as it is withdrawn from the vagina. Care must be taken not to spill any of the ejaculate from the condom.''Each condom must be discarded after a single use. A new condom must be used for the next act of intercourse. Male condoms are not reusable.''Condoms can be purchased over-the-counter (OTC) without a prescription. Most of those on the market are made of latex. The estimated effectiveness of the latex condom is 87% to 90% or 10 to 13 ''pregnancies''/100 women per year of sexual activity.''About 1% to 3% of people are ''allergic'' to latex. In such cases, they may be able to use condoms made of polyurethane, a type of plastic, can often be used. However, polyurethane condoms may break more easily than latex condoms and they do not protect against sexually transmitted infections (sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs).''Latex condoms afford the maximum protection against sexually transmitted infections including ''HIV'' (human immunodeficiency virus) and ''herpes'' virus. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), consistent and correct usage of latex condoms:''Animal membrane condoms, made from the ''intestines'' of sheep, when used with contraceptive foam, can be effective in preventing pregnancy, but they may not provide adequate protection against all sexually transmitted infections. This is because the pores in the animal tissue permit small organisms such as ''viruses'' to pass through.''The most frequent complaint lodged regarding condoms is that their usage decreases sexual pleasure for the male. This is an unfortunate attitude because male condoms are an effective, acceptable, inexpensive, and safe method of birth control.' is highly effective in preventing sexual transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. reduces the risk for many STDs that are transmitted by genital fluids (STDs such as Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis). reduces the risk for genital ulcer diseases, such as genital herpes, syphilis, and chancroid, only when the infected area or site of potential exposure is protected. may reduce the risk for genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-associated diseases (for example, genital warts and cervical cancer)."
Female condom,"""The female condom is not well known in the United States. It is essentially a cylindrical vaginal pouch made of soft polyurethane (a type of plastic) with a ring at either end. One end of the pouch is open. The other end is closed. A woman inserts the closed end high up in her vagina over her cervix. The open end remains on the outside of her vagina. The vagina is now lined with the condom. When she has intercourse, the man inserts his penis into the open end of the woman's condom. Once intercourse is over and the man withdraws his penis, the condom containing the semen can now be removed and discarded.""'The female condom can be put in up to 8 hours before intercourse. A significant amount of practice may be necessary before a woman can properly insert and position a female condom. The sides of the internal ring can be folded together and inserted into the vagina much like a diaphragm is inserted. The female condom is thinner than the male condom and is resistant to degradation by oil-based lubricants.''A female condom should never be used when the man is also wearing a condom. The two condoms can stick together and tear, resulting in a total loss of protection.''The female condom (Reality) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1993. The Reality Condom is made of polyurethane, but other types of female condoms are available in other areas of the world. Its estimated effectiveness is 85% (15 pregnancies/100 women per year) as compared to 87% to 90% for the male condom.''Problems associated with the female condom include irritation and allergic reactions to the polyurethane. Other concerns are that the female condom is cumbersome, difficult to insert, may not remain in place, and is unattractive. It may also produce unpleasant noises if there is not enough lubrication. For this reason, most female condoms are now generously pre-lubricated with silicone and packets of additional lubricant are included. The lubricant does not contain spermicide.''The female condom (Reality) can be purchased over-the counter (OTC) without a prescription, but it may cost more than a male condom. Package instructions currently advise single use but studies are underway to determine if the female condom can be safely washed and reused up to five times.''The main disadvantage of the female condom is that it is not as effective as its male latex counterpart.''The main disadvantage of the female condom is that it is not as effective as the male latex condom in preventing pregnancy.' "
Contraceptive sponge,"'The contraceptive sponge is a doughnut-shaped ring of polyurethane foam and is impregnated with the spermicide Nonoxynol-9. This chemical confers most of the contraceptive efficacy of this product.''Before intercourse, a woman inserts the sponge high into the vagina in the manner similar to the insertion of a tampon. The spermicidal sponge should then act as a barrier in order to prevent sperm from reaching the cervix. Once in place, the sponge provides protection for up to 24 hours without the need for additional spermicide.''The sponge must remain in the vagina for at least 6 hours following intercourse in order to provide optimum contraception. However, the same sponge should never remain in the vagina for more than a total of 30 hours because of the risk of ''toxic shock syndrome''. (''Toxic shock syndrome'' is an uncommon and potentially very serious illness that is caused by a type of bacteria. This illness occurs when certain types of products, such as tampons,are left in place for excessive periods of time. Package inserts for these products are careful to specify how long they may be safely kept in place. Each sponge is discarded after a single use.''The sponge is generally an effective birth control. Some users of the contraceptive sponge may experience irritation and allergic reactions. The sponge can also be difficult to remove from the vagina. Removal has been made easier by the addition of a woven polyester loop which can be more easily grasped with the fingers.''The estimated contraceptive efficacy of the sponge is estimated to be between 64% and 82%. The spermicide may provide some protection against ''Chlamydia'' and gonorrhea, but otherwise, the degree of this protection is unknown.' "
Diaphragm,"'The diaphragm is a soft, flexible, dome-shaped latex cup which is inserted into the vagina prior to intercourse. The rim of the cup contains a coil spring of metal which serves to hold it in place. The diaphragm blocks access to the cervix so that sperm cannot pass from the vagina into the uterus. The diaphragm must be covered on both sides and especially around its rim with spermicidal jelly, cream, or foam in order to form a tight seal with the vaginal walls.''A woman should insert the diaphragm into her vagina no more than 4 hours prior to intercourse. Following ''coitus'', she should check the diaphragm should be checked to ensure that it was not mechanically dislodged. The diaphragm must be left in place for at least 6-8 hours following intercourse, at which time it should be removed. Additional spermicidal jelly or foam must be inserted into the vagina each act of intercourse.''Since diaphragms are only available with a prescription, a woman must see a health care practitioner to have a diaphragm properly fitted (they come in a range of sizes), and to learn proper insertion techniques. There are no known long-term health risks associated with using the diaphragm and spermicide method of birth control. Some women may find spermicides to be irritating, but changing brands of spermicides may help. There is also an increased risk of ''urinary tract infections'' with diaphragm use. One possible reason is that the diaphragm puts increased pressure on the urethra or the spermicide may contribute to irritation leading to infection. (The cervical cap is not associated with increases in ''urinary tract infections''.)''The diaphragm may be appealing to women because it offers a safe temporary (not permanent) birth control that is under her control.''When the diaphragm and spermicide are used correctly, they are thought to have over an 82% success rate (18 pregnancies/100 women per year). To ensure protection, it is important to check the diaphragm after every use for rips or holes after each usage. This is best accomplished by filling the diaphragm with water and then holding it up to the light to observe for leakage. Also, the fit of the diaphragm should be checked annually, following pregnancy, and after significant ''weight loss''.''Using a diaphragm does not confer protection against sexually transmitted infections, although the spermicide does give partial protection against gonorrhea and Chlamydia. It can, however, be used with condoms in order to confer some protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).' "
Cervical cap,"'The cervical cap is a small (1-1/2 inches or about 3 cm.), thimble-shaped dome made of latex or silicone rubber (it is much smaller than a diaphragm) which fits directly over the cervix. The cervical cap is used in conjunction with a spermicide. One small application of spermicide is placed inside the cap at the time of insertion. The cap plus spermicide prevent sperm from going through the cervix and entering the uterus.''The cervical cap is gently inserted into the vagina and positioned over her cervix. It can be inserted as long as 8 hours prior to intercourse, and can be allowed to remain in place for up to 48 hours. Unlike the diaphragm, fresh spermicidal jelly or foam does not need to be added with each act of intercourse as long as the cervical cap is correctly positioned over the cervix.''As with the diaphragm, a cervical cap requires a prescription. A woman must see a health care practitioner to determine the correct size and to ensure that she understands the proper insertion and removal techniques.''There are no known significant health risks associated with using the cervical cap and spermicide. The cervical cap can be difficult to insert, but it may be helpful for women who are unable to use a diaphragm because of poor muscle tone. Women who suffer from recurring urinary tract infections related to diaphragm usage may also want to elect to try the cervical cap.''It is important to remember that using a cervical cap does not protect from sexually transmitted infections, although spermicides may give some protection against Chlamydia and gonorrhea.''When the cervical cap and spermicide are used properly, they are more than 80% effective in achieving reliable contraception.' "
Facts you should know about diarrhea," Diarrhea is an increase in the frequency of bowel movements, an increase in the looseness of stool or both. Diarrhea is caused by increased secretion of fluid into the intestine, reduced absorption of fluid from the intestine or rapid passage of stool through the intestine. Symptoms associated with diarrhea include abdominal pain, especially cramping. Other symptoms depend on the cause of the diarrhea. Diarrhea can be defined absolutely or relatively. Absolute diarrhea is defined as more than five bowel movements a day or liquid stools. Relative diarrhea is defined as an increase in the number of bowel movements per day or an increase in the looseness of stools compared with an individual's usual bowel habit. Diarrhea may be either acute or chronic, and each has different causes and treatments. Complications of diarrhea include dehydration, electrolyte (mineral) abnormalities, and irritation of the anus. Tests that are useful in the evaluation of acute diarrhea include examination of stool for white blood cells or enzymes that they produce, parasites, cultures of stool for bacteria, testing of stool for the toxins of  C. difficile, and blood tests for electrolyte abnormalities. Tests that are useful in the evaluation of chronic diarrhea include examination of stool for parasites, upper gastrointestinal X-rays (UGI series), barium enema, esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsies, colonoscopy with biopsies, small intestinal endoscopy with biopsies, hydrogen breath testing, measurement of fat in the stool, and pancreatic function tests. Dehydration can be treated at home with home remedies, oral rehydration solutions. Absorbents (that absorb water in the intestine), anti-motility medications, bismuth compounds, and IV fluids if necessary. Antibiotics should not be used in treating diarrhea unless there is a culture-proven bacterial infection that requires antibiotics, severe diarrhea that is likely to be infectious in origin, or an individual has serious underlying diseases."
What is diarrhea?,"'Diarrhea is an increase in the frequency of bowel movements or a decrease in the form of stool (greater looseness of stool). Although changes in frequency of bowel movements and looseness of stools can vary independently of each other, changes often occur in both.''Diarrhea needs to be distinguished from four other conditions. Although these conditions may accompany diarrhea, they often have different causes and different treatments than diarrhea. These other conditions are:'   Incontinence of stool, which is the inability to control (delay) bowel movements until an appropriate time, for example, until one can get to the toilet Rectal urgency, which is a sudden urge to have a bowel movement that is so strong that if a toilet is not immediately available there will be incontinence Incomplete evacuation, which is a sensation that another bowel movement is necessary soon after a bowel movement, yet there is difficulty passing further stool the second time Bowel movements immediately after eating a meal"
What is considered diarrhea?,"'Diarrhea can be defined in absolute or relative terms based on either the frequency of bowel movements or the consistency (looseness) of stools.''Frequency of bowel movements:'' Absolute diarrhea is having more bowel movements than normal. Thus, since among healthy individuals the maximum number of daily bowel movements is approximately three, diarrhea can be defined as any number of stools greater than three, although some consider five or more bowel movements to be diarrhea. ""''Relative diarrhea''"" is having more bowel movements than usual. Thus, if an individual who usually has one bowel movement each day begins to have two bowel movements each day, then relative diarrhea is present-even though there are not more than three or five bowel movements a day, that is, there is not absolute diarrhea.''Consistency of stools:'' Absolute diarrhea is more difficult to define on the consistency of stool because the consistency of stool can vary considerably in healthy individuals depending on their diets. Thus, individuals who eat large amounts of vegetables will have looser stools than individuals who eat few vegetables and/or fruits. Stools that are liquid or watery are always abnormal and considered diarrheal. Relative diarrhea is easier to define based on the consistency of stool. Thus, an individual who develops looser stools than usual has relative diarrhea--even though the stools may be within the range of normal with respect to consistency.''With diarrhea, stools usually are looser whether or not the frequency of bowel movements have increased. This looseness of stool--which can vary all the way from slightly soft to watery--is caused by increased water in the stool. During normal ''digestion'', food is kept liquid by the secretion of large amounts of water by the stomach, upper small intestine, pancreas, and gallbladder. Food that is not digested reaches the lower small intestine and colon in liquid form. The lower small intestine and particularly the colon absorb the water, turning the undigested food into a more-or-less solid stool with form. Increased amounts of water in stool can occur if the stomach and/or small intestine secrete too much fluid, the distal small intestine and colon do not absorb enough water, or the undigested, liquid food passes too quickly through the small intestine and colon for enough water to be removed.''Another way of looking at the ''reasons for diarrhea'' is to divide it into five types.''Diarrhea generally is divided into two types, acute and chronic.''It is important to distinguish between acute and chronic diarrhea because they usually have different causes, require different diagnostic tests, and require different treatment.' The first is referred to as secretory diarrhea because too much fluid is secreted into the intestine. The second type is referred to as osmotic diarrhea in which small molecules that pass into the colon without being digested and absorbed draw water and electrolytes into the colon and stool. The third type is referred to as motility-related diarrhea in which the intestinal muscles are overactive and transport the intestinal contents through the intestine without enough time for water and electrolytes to be absorbed. The fourth type is unusual. It is best represented by a condition called  collagenous colitis. In collagenous colitis, the mechanism of the diarrhea may be the inability of the colon to absorb fluid and electrolytes because of the extensive scarring of the intestinal lining. Inflammation also may play a role. The fifth type of diarrhea is referred to as inflammatory diarrhea and involves more than one mechanism. For example, some viruses, bacteria, and parasites cause increased secretion of fluid, either by invading and inflaming the lining of the small intestine (inflammation stimulates the lining to secrete fluid) or by producing toxins (chemicals) that also stimulate the lining to secrete fluid but without causing inflammation. Inflammation of the small intestine and/or colon from bacteria or from non-bacterial ileitis/colitis can increase the rapidity with which food passes through the intestines, reducing the time that is available for absorbing water. Acute diarrhea lasts from a few days up to a week. Chronic diarrhea can be defined in several ways, but usually lasts more than three weeks."
What signs and symptoms are associated with diarrhea?,"'The symptoms associated with diarrhea depend on the cause and type of diarrhea.' If there is a large secretory component to the diarrhea if the bowel movements are frequent and watery. Pain is not common, and there are no signs of inflammation. Similarly, an osmotic diarrhea is watery, but its main characteristic is that once ingestion of food stops (which would include the offending dietary food or substance that is not digested or absorbed) the diarrhea stops. Motility related diarrhea is more likely to be associated with cramping abdominal pain. Inflammatory diarrhea often is associated with crampy abdominal pain as well as signs of inflammation, for example, fever, and abdominal tenderness. It also may be associated with intestinal bleeding, either with visible blood in the stool or invisible blood that only is detected by testing the stool for blood. Although one might expect the diarrhea of collagenous colitis to be painless (since diarrhea is believed to be due to poor absorption of fluid and electrolytes), in fact, it is frequently associated with abdominal pain, suggesting that there is more to collagenous colitis than a failure to absorb fluid and electrolytes."
What are common causes of acute diarrhea?,"'The most common cause of acute diarrhea is infection--viral, bacterial, and parasitic. Bacteria also can cause acute ''food poisoning''. A third important cause of acute diarrhea is starting a new medication since many medications can cause diarrhea.' "
Traveler's diarrhea,"'There are many ''strains'' of ''E. coli'' bacteria. Most of the ''E. coli'' bacteria are normal inhabitants of the small intestine and colon and are non-pathogenic, meaning they do not cause disease in the intestines. Nevertheless, these non-pathogenic ''E. coli'' can cause diseases if they spread outside of the intestines, for example, into the urinary tract (where they cause bladder or kidney infections) or into the blood stream (''sepsis'').''Certain strains of ''E. coli, ''however, are pathogenic (meaning they can cause disease in the small intestine and colon). These pathogenic strains of ''E. coli'' cause diarrhea either by producing toxins (called enterotoxigenic ''E. coli'' or ETEC) or by invading and inflaming the lining of the small intestine and the colon and causing enterocolitis (called enteropathogenic E. coli or EPEC). '""Traveler's diarrhea""' usually is caused by an ETEC strain of ''E. coli'' that produces a diarrhea-inducing toxin.''Tourists visiting foreign countries with warm climates and poor sanitation (Mexico, parts of Africa, etc.) can acquire ETEC by eating contaminated foods such as fruits, vegetables, seafood, raw meat, water, and ice cubes. Toxins produced by ETEC cause the sudden onset of diarrhea, abdominal ''cramps'', ''nausea'', and sometimes ''vomiting''. These symptoms usually occur 3-7 days after arrival in the foreign country and generally subside within 3 days. Occasionally, other bacteria or parasites can cause diarrhea in ''travelers'' (for example, ''Shigella'', ''Giardia'', ''and'' Campylobacter''). Diarrhea caused by these other organisms usually lasts longer than 3 days.' "
Viral gastroenteritis,"'Viral ''gastroenteritis'' (viral infection of the stomach and the small intestine) is the most common cause of acute diarrhea worldwide.''Symptoms of viral gastroenteritis typically last only 48-72 hours and include:''Unlike bacterial enterocolitis (bacterial infection of the small intestine and colon), patients with viral gastroenteritis usually do not have blood or pus in their stools and have little if any ''fever''.''Viral gastroenteritis can occur in a sporadic form (in a single individual) or in an epidemic form (among groups of individuals).''The caliciviruses are transmitted by food that is contaminated by sick food-handlers or by person-to-person contact.' nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Sporadic diarrhea probably is caused by several different viruses and is believed to be spread by person-to-person contact. The most common cause of epidemic diarrhea (for example, on cruise ships) is infection with a family of viruses known as caliciviruses of which the genus norovirus is the most common (for example, ""Norwalk agent"")."
Bacterial enterocolitis,"'Disease-causing bacteria usually invade the small intestines and colon and cause enterocolitis (inflammation of the small intestine and colon). Bacterial enterocolitis is characterized by signs of inflammation (blood or pus in the stool, fever, abdominal tenderness), as well as abdominal pain and diarrhea. ''Campylobacter jejuni'' is the most common bacterium that causes acute enterocolitis in the U.S. Other bacteria that cause enterocolitis include ''Shigella, ''Salmonella'', and EPEC. These bacteria usually are acquired by drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated foods such as vegetables, poultry, and dairy products.''Enterocolitis caused by the bacterium ''Clostridium difficile'' is unusual because it often is caused by antibiotic treatment. ''Clostridium difficile'' is also the most common nosocomial infection (infection acquired while in the hospital) to cause diarrhea. Unfortunately, infection also is increasing among individuals who have neither taken antibiotics nor have been in the hospital.''E. coli O157:H7'' is a strain of ''E. coli'' that produces a toxin that causes hemorrhagic enterocolitis (enterocolitis with bleeding). There was a famous outbreak of hemorrhagic enterocolitis in the U.S. traced to contaminated ground beef in hamburgers (hence, it is also called hamburger colitis). A small percentage of patients infected with ''E. coli O157:H7,'' particularly children, can develop ''hemolytic uremic syndrome'' (''HUS''), a syndrome that can lead to ''kidney failure''. Some evidence suggests that prolonged use of anti-diarrhea agents or use of antibiotics may increase the chance of developing ''HUS''.' "
Food poisoning,"'Food poisoning'' is a brief illness that is caused by toxins produced by bacteria. The toxins cause abdominal pain (cramps) and vomiting, which causes the small intestine to secrete large amounts of water that leads to diarrhea. The symptoms of food poisoning usually last less than 24 hours. With some bacteria, the toxins are produced in the food before it is eaten, while with other bacteria, the toxins are produced in the intestine after the food is eaten.''Symptoms usually appear within several hours when food poisoning is caused by toxins that are formed in the food before it is eaten. It takes longer for symptoms to develop when the toxins are formed in the intestine (because it takes time for the bacteria to produce the toxins). Therefore, in the latter case, symptoms usually appear after 7-15 hours.''Staphylococcus aureus'' '' is an example of a bacterium that produces toxins in food before it is eaten. Typically, food contaminated with ''Staphylococcus'' (such as salad, meat, or sandwiches with mayonnaise) is left un-refrigerated at room temperature overnight. The ''Staphylococcal'' bacteria multiply in the food and produce toxins. ''Clostridium perfringens'' is an example of a bacterium that multiplies in food (usually canned food), and produces toxins in the small intestine after the contaminated food is eaten.'  "
Parasites,'Parasitic infections are not common causes of diarrhea in the U. S. Infection with ''Giardia lamblia'' occurs among individuals who hike in the mountains or travel abroad and is transmitted by contaminated drinking water. Infection with ''Giardia'' usually is not associated with inflammation; there is no blood or pus in the stool and little fever. Infection with amoeba (amoebic dysentery) usually occurs during travel abroad to undeveloped countries and is associated with signs of inflammation--blood or pus in the stool and fever.''Cryptosporidium ''is a diarrhea-producing parasite that is spread by contaminated water because it can survive chlorination. ''Cyclospora'' is a diarrhea-producing parasite that has been associated with contaminated raspberries from Guatemala.' 
Medicines that causes diarrhea,"'Drug-induced diarrhea is very common because many ''drugs'' cause diarrhea. The clue to drug-induced diarrhea is that the diarrhea begins soon after treatment with the drug is begun. The medications that most frequently cause diarrhea are antacids and nutritional ''supplements'' that contain magnesium. Other classes of medication that cause diarrhea include:''A few examples of specific medications that commonly cause diarrhea are:' Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Chemotherapy medications Antibiotics Medications to control irregular heartbeats (antiarrhythmics) Medications for high blood pressure misoprostol (Cytotec) quinidine (Quinaglute, Quinidex) olsalazine (Dipentum) colchicine (Colchicine) metoclopramide (Reglan) cisapride (Propulsid, Motilium)"
What are common causes of chronic diarrhea?,"'Irritable bowel syndrome'':'' The ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS'') is a functional cause of diarrhea or ''constipation''. Inflammation does not typically exist in the affected bowel. (Nevertheless, recent information suggests that MAY be a component of inflammation in ''IBS''.) It may be caused by several different underlying problems, but it is believed that the most common cause is rapid passage of the intestinal contents through the colon.''Infectious diseases:'' A few infectious diseases can cause chronic diarrhea, for example, ''Giardia lamblia''. Patients with ''AIDS'' often have chronic infections of their intestines that cause diarrhea.''Bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine:'' Because of small intestinal problems, normal colonic bacteria may spread from the colon and into the small intestine. When they do, they are in a position to digest food that the small intestine has not had time to digest and absorb. The mechanism that leads to the development of diarrhea in bacterial overgrowth is not clear.''Post-infectious:'' Following acute viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections, some individuals develop chronic diarrhea. The cause of this type of diarrhea is not clear, but some of the individuals may have bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine. They also have been found to have abnormalities, either microscopic or biochemical, in biopsies of the intestines that suggest that there may be inflammation. This condition also is referred to as post-infectious ''IBS''.''Inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD''):'"" Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis'', diseases causing inflammation of the small intestine and/or colon, commonly cause chronic diarrhea.''Colon cancer'':'' Colon ''cancer'' can cause either diarrhea or ''constipation''. If the ''cancer'' blocks the passage of stool, it usually causes ''constipation''. Sometimes, however, there is secretion of water behind the blockage, and liquid stool from behind the blockage leaks around the ''cancer'' and results in diarrhea. Cancer, particularly in the distal part of the colon, can lead to thin stools. The diarrhea or constipation caused by cancer usually is progressive, that is, becomes progressively worse. Cancer in the rectum can lead to a sense of incomplete evacuation.''Severe constipation:'' By blocking the colon, hardened stool can lead to the same problems as colon cancer, as discussed previously.''Carbohydrate (''sugar'') malabsorption:'' Carbohydrate or ''sugar'' malabsorption is an inability to digest and absorb sugars. The most recognized malabsorption of sugar occurs with ''lactase deficiency'' (also known as lactose or milk intolerance) in which milk products containing the milk sugar, lactose, lead to diarrhea. The lactose is not broken up in the intestine because of the absence of an intestinal enzyme, lactase that normally breaks up lactose into its component sugars, galactose, and glucose. Without being broken up, lactose cannot be absorbed into the body. The undigested lactose reaches the colon and pulls water (by osmosis) into the colon. The lactose also is digested by colonic bacteria into ''gas'' (hydrogen and methane) as well as chemicals that promote the retention or secretion of fluid in the colon. The result of these events leads to diarrhea. Although lactose is the most common form of sugar malabsorption, other sugars in the ''diet'' also may cause diarrhea, including fructose and ''sorbitol''.''Fat malabsorption:'' Malabsorption of fat is the inability to digest or absorb fat. Fat malabsorption may occur because of reduced pancreatic secretions that are necessary for normal digestion of fat (for example, due to ''pancreatitis'' or ''pancreatic cancer'') or by diseases of the lining of the small intestine that prevent the absorption of digested fat (for example, ''celiac disease''). Undigested fat enters the last part of the small intestine and colon where bacteria turn it into substances (chemicals) that cause water to be secreted by the small intestine and colon. Passage through the small intestine and colon also may be more rapid when there is malabsorption of fat.''Endocrine diseases:'' Several endocrine diseases (imbalances of hormones) may cause diarrhea, for example, an over-active thyroid gland (''hyperthyroidism'"") and an under-active pituitary or adrenal gland (Addison's disease).""'Laxative abuse'':'' The abuse of laxatives by individuals who want attention or to ''lose weight'' is an occasional cause of chronic diarrhea.'  "
When should you call a doctor for diarrhea?,"'Most episodes of diarrhea are mild and of short duration and do not need to be brought to the attention of a doctor. The doctor should be consulted when there is:' High fever (temperature greater than 101 F or 38.3 C Moderate or severe abdominal pain or tenderness Bloody diarrhea that suggests severe intestinal inflammation Diarrhea in persons with serious underlying illness for whom dehydration may have more serious consequences, for example, persons with diabetes, heart disease, and AIDS Severe diarrhea that shows no improvement after 48 hours. Moderate or severe dehydration Prolonged vomiting that prevents intake of fluids orally Acute diarrhea in pregnant women because of concern for the health of the fetus Diarrhea that occurs during or immediately after completing a course of antibiotics because the diarrhea may represent antibiotic-associated infection with C. difficile that requires treatment Diarrhea after returning from developing countries or from camping in the mountains because there may be infection with Giardia (for which there is treatment) Diarrhea that develops in patients with chronic intestinal diseases such as colitis, or Crohn's disease because the diarrhea may represent worsening of the underlying disease or a complication of the disease, both requiring treatment Acute diarrhea in an infant or young child in order to ensure the appropriate use of oral liquids (type, amount, and rate), to prevent or treat dehydration, and to prevent complications of inappropriate use of liquids such as seizures and abnormal blood electrolytes (minerals) Chronic diarrhea"
How is the cause of diarrhea diagnosed?,"'Acute diarrhea:'' Acute diarrhea usually requires few tests.''Chronic diarrhea:'' With chronic diarrhea, the focus usually shifts from dehydration and infection (with the exception of Giardia, which occasionally causes chronic infections) to the diagnosis of non-infectious causes of diarrhea. (See the prior discussion of common causes of chronic diarrhea.)' Measurement of blood pressure in the sitting and then then the upright positions can demonstrate orthostatic hypotension (a marked drop in blood pressure) and confirm the presence of dehydration. If moderate or severe dehydration or electrolyte deficiencies are likely, blood electrolytes can be measured. Examination of a small amount of stool under the microscope may reveal white blood cells indicating that intestinal inflammation is present and prompting further testing, particularly bacterial cultures of stool and examination of stool for parasites. If antibiotics have been taken within the previous two weeks, stool should be tested for the toxin of C. difficile  or the bacterial gene that is reasonable for the production of the toxin. It also is possible to culture the C. difficile bacterium. Testing stool or blood for viruses is performed only rarely, since there is no specific treatment for the viruses that cause gastroenteritis. If there has been recent travel to undeveloped countries or the mountains, stool may be examined under the microscope for Giardia and other parasites. There are also immunologic tests that can be done on samples of stool to diagnose infection with Giardia. This may require X-rays of the intestines (upper gastrointestinal series and/or barium enema), or endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, EGD, or colonoscopy) with biopsies. Examination of the small intestine via a camera-containing capsule. Specialized small intestinal endoscopy also can be done to visually examine and biopsy the small intestine. Fat malabsorption can be diagnosed by measuring the fat in a 72-hour collection of stool. More abbreviated collections are less accurate. Sugar malabsorption can be diagnosed by eliminating the offending sugar from the diet or by performing a hydrogen breath test. Hydrogen breath testing also can be used to diagnose bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine. An under-active pituitary or adrenal gland and an overactive thyroid gland can be diagnosed by measuring blood levels of cortisol and thyroid hormone, respectively. Celiac disease can be diagnosed with blood tests and a biopsy of the small intestine."
What is the treatment of diarrhea in infants and children?,"'Most acute diarrhea in infants and young children is due to viral gastroenteritis and is usually short-lived. Antibiotics are not routinely prescribed for viral gastroenteritis. However, fever, vomiting, and ''loose stools'' can be symptoms of other childhood infections such as ''otitis media'' (infection of the middle ear), ''pneumonia'', ''bladder infection'', ''sepsis'' (bacterial infection in the blood) and meningitis. These illnesses may require early antibiotic treatment.''Infants with acute diarrhea also can quickly become severely dehydrated and therefore need early rehydration. For these reasons, sick infants with diarrhea should be evaluated by their pediatricians to identify and treat underlying infections as well as to provide instructions on the proper use of oral rehydration products.''Infants with moderate to severe dehydration usually are treated with intravenous fluids in the hospital. The pediatrician may decide to treat infants who are mildly dehydrated due to viral gastroenteritis at home with oral rehydration solutions.''Infants that are ''breastfed'' or ''formula-fed'' should continue to receive ''breast milk'' during the rehydration phase of their illness if not prevented by vomiting. During, and for a short time after recovering from viral gastroenteritis, ''babies'' can be lactose intolerant due to a temporary deficiency of the enzyme, lactase (necessary to digest the lactose in milk) in the small intestine. Infants with ''lactose intolerance'' can develop worsening diarrhea and cramps when dairy products are introduced. Therefore, after rehydration with oral rehydration solutions, an undiluted lactose-free formula and diluted juices are recommended. Milk products can be gradually increased as the infant improves.' "
What is the treatment for diarrhea in older children and adults?,"'During mild cases of diarrhea, diluted fruit juices, soft ''drinks'' containing sugar, sports drinks such as Gatorade and water can be used to prevent dehydration. ''Caffeine'' and lactose containing dairy products should be temporarily avoided since they can aggravate diarrhea, the latter primarily in individuals with transient lactose intolerance. If there is no nausea and vomiting, solid foods should be continued. Foods that usually are well tolerated during a diarrheal illness include rice, cereal, bananas, potatoes, and lactose-free products.''Oral rehydration solutions can be used for moderately severe diarrhea that is accompanied by dehydration in children older than 10 years of age and in adults. These solutions are given at 50 ml/kg over 4-6 hours for mild dehydration or 100 ml/kg over 6 hours for moderate dehydration. After rehydration, the oral rehydration solution can be used to maintain hydration at 100 ml to 200 ml/kg over 24 hours until the diarrhea stops. Directions on the solution label usually state the amounts that are appropriate. After rehydration, older children and adults should resume solid food as soon as any nausea and vomiting subside. Solid food should begin with rice, cereal, bananas, potatoes, and lactose free and low fat products. The variety of foods can be expanded as the diarrhea subsides.' "
What home remedies help the symptoms of diarrhea?,"'Many home remedies have been suggested for the treatment of diarrhea; however, few of them have been well studied. Three that have been studied and appear to be effective are:' Pectin Cooked green bananas Probiotics"
When should antibiotics be used for diarrhea?,"'Most episodes of diarrhea are acute and of short duration and do not require antibiotics. Antibiotics are not even necessary for the most common ''bacterial infections'' that cause diarrhea.''Antibiotics, however, often are used when'   patients have more severe and persistent diarrhea, patients have additional debilitating diseases such as heart failure, lung disease, and AIDS, stool examination and testing discloses parasites, more serious bacterial infections (for example, Shigella), or C. difficile, and traveler's diarrhea."
Which medications treat diarrhea?,"'Absorbents are compounds that absorb water. Absorbents that are taken orally bind water in the small intestine and colon and make diarrheal stools less watery. They also may bind toxic chemicals produced by bacteria that cause the small intestine to secrete fluid; however, the importance of toxin binding in reducing diarrhea is unclear.''The two main absorbents are ''attapulgite'' (a naturally occurring complex mineral) and polycarbophil (a ''fiber'') both available without prescriptions. Psyllium, another absorbent has been used for mild diarrhea, but is primarily used for constipation.''Examples of products containing attapulgite are:''Examples of products containing polycarbophil are:''Products containing polycarbophil have been used to treat both diarrhea and constipation. Attapulgite and polycarbophil remain in the intestine and, therefore, have no side effects outside of the gastrointestinal tract. They may occasionally cause constipation and ''bloating''. One concern is that absorbents also can bind medications and interfere with their absorption into the body. For this reason, it often is recommended that medications and absorbents be taken several hours apart so that they are physically separated within the intestines.''Anti-motility medications are drugs that relax the muscles of the small intestine and/or the colon. Relaxation results in slower flow of intestinal contents. Slower flow allows more time for water to be absorbed from the intestine and colon and reduces the water content of stool. Cramps, due to spasm of the intestinal muscles, also are relieved by the muscular relaxation.''The two main anti-motility medications are ''loperamide'' (''Imodium''), which is available without a prescription, and diphenoxylate (''Lomotil''), which requires a prescription. Both medications are related to opiates (for example, ''codeine'') but neither has the pain-relieving effects of opiates.''Loperamide (Imodium), though related to opiates, does not cause ''addiction''.''Diphenoxylate is a man-made medication that at high doses can be addictive because of its opiate-like, euphoric (mood-elevating) effects. In order to prevent abuse of diphenoxylate and addiction, a second medication, ''atropine'', is added to loperamide in Lomotil. If too much Lomotil is ingested, unpleasant side effects from too much atropine will occur.''Loperamide and diphenoxylate are safe and well tolerated. There are some precautions, however, that should be observed.''Many bismuth-containing preparations are available around the world. Bismuth subsalicylate (''Pepto-Bismol'') is available in the US. It contains two potentially active ingredients, bismuth and salicylate (''aspirin''). It is not clear how effective bismuth compounds are, except in ''traveler'""'s diarrhea and the treatment of ""'H. pylori'' infection of the stomach where they have been shown to be effective. It also is not clear how bismuth subsalicylate might work. It is thought to have some antibiotic-like properties that affect bacteria that cause diarrhea. The salicylate is anti-inflammatory and could reduce secretion of water by reducing inflammation. Bismuth also might directly reduce the secretion of water by the intestine.''Pepto-Bismol is well tolerated. Minor side effects include darkening of the stool and tongue. Several precautions that should be observed when using Pepto-Bismol.'   Donnagel Rheaban Kaopectate Advanced Formula Parepectolin Diasorb Equalactin Konsyl Daily Fiber Therapy Mitrolan Polycarb Anti-motility medications should not be used without a doctor's guidance to treat diarrhea caused by moderate or severe ulcerative colitis, C. difficile colitis, and intestinal infections by bacteria that invade the intestine (for example, Shigella). Their use may lead to more serious inflammation and prolong the infections. Diphenoxylate can cause drowsiness or dizziness, and caution should be used if driving or if tasks that require alertness and coordination are required. Anti-motility medications should not be used in children younger than two years of age. Most unimportant, acute diarrhea should improve within 72 hours. If symptoms do not improve or if they worsen, a doctor should be consulted before continuing treatment with anti-motility medications. Since it contains salicylate, a chemical related to aspirin (acetyl salicylate), patients who are allergic to aspirin should not take Pepto-Bismol. Pepto-Bismol should not be used with other aspirin-containing medications since too much aspirin may be ingested and lead to aspirin toxicity, the most common manifestation of which is ringing in the ears. The salicylate in Pepto-Bismol, similar to aspirin, can accentuate the effects of anticoagulants, particularly warfarin (Coumadin), and lead to excessive bleeding. It also may cause abnormal bleeding in people who have a tendency to bleed because of genetic disorders or underlying diseases, for example, cirrhosis that also may cause abnormal bleeding. The salicylate in Pepto-Bismol can aggravate stomach and duodenal ulcer disease like aspirin. Pepto-Bismol and salicylate-containing products should not be given to children and teenagers with chickenpox, influenza, and other viral infections because they may cause Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a serious illness affecting primarily the liver and brain that can lead to liver failure and coma, with a mortality rate of at least 20%. Pepto-Bismol should not be given to infants and children younger than two years of age."
Which types of doctors treat diarrhea?,"'Gastroenterologists are the specialists who usually manage patients with diarrhea and pursue the diagnosis of its cause, particularly when the diarrhea is chronic.' "
What are the complications of diarrhea?,"'Dehydration occurs when there is excessive loss of fluids and minerals (electrolytes) from the body due to diarrhea, with or without vomiting.''Electrolytes (minerals) are lost with water when diarrhea is prolonged or severe, and mineral or electrolyte deficiencies may occur. The most common deficiencies occur with sodium and potassium. Abnormalities of chloride and bicarbonate also may develop.''Finally, there may be irritation of the anus due to the frequent passage of watery stool containing irritating substances.' Dehydration is common among adult patients with acute diarrhea who have large amounts of watery stool, particularly when the intake of fluids is limited by lethargy or is associated with nausea and vomiting. It also is common in infants and young children who develop viral gastroenteritis or bacterial infection. Patients with mild dehydration may experience only thirst and dry mouth. Moderate to severe dehydration may cause orthostatic hypotension with (fainting or light-headedness upon standing) due to a reduced volume of blood, which causes a drop in blood pressure upon standing). A diminished urine output, severe weakness, shock, kidney failure, confusion, acidosis (too much acid in the blood), and coma."
How can dehydration from diarrhea be prevented and treated?,"'Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are liquids that contain a carbohydrate (glucose or rice syrup) and electrolyte (sodium, potassium, chloride, and citrate or bicarbonate). Originally, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the WHO-ORS to rapidly rehydrate victims of the severe diarrheal illness, ''cholera''. The WHO-ORS solution contains glucose and electrolytes. The glucose in the solution is important because it forces the small intestine to quickly absorb the fluid and the electrolytes. The purpose of the electrolytes in the solution is the ''prevention'' and treatment of electrolyte deficiencies.''In the U.S., convenient, premixed commercial ORS products that are similar to the WHO-ORS are available for rehydration and prevention of dehydration. Examples of these products are ''Pedialyte'', Rehydralyte, Infalyte, and Resol.''Most of the commercially available ORS products in the U.S. contain glucose. Infalyte is the only one that contains rice carbohydrate instead of glucose. Most doctors believe that there are no important differences in effectiveness between glucose and rice carbohydrate.' "
Facts and definition of IBS-D,"   Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder. Symptoms of IBS include:Abdominal cramping or painBloatingGassinessAltered bowel habits (alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation). Abdominal cramping or pain Bloating Gassiness Altered bowel habits (alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation). The cause of IBS currently is unknown. It is thought to result from a combination of abnormal gastrointestinal (GI) tract movements, increased awareness of bodily functions, and a disruption in the communication between the brain and the GI tract. IBS-D is irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea. The most common symptoms of the disorder include:Sudden urges to have bowel movementsAbdominal pain or discomfortGasLoose stoolsFrequent stoolsFeeling of being unable to completely empty bowelsNausea Sudden urges to have bowel movements Abdominal pain or discomfort Gas Loose stools Frequent stools Feeling of being unable to completely empty bowels Nausea IBS is diagnosed by exclusion, which means a doctor considers other alternatives first, performing tests to rule out other medical problems. There are new blood tests that may help diagnose some forms of IBS.Home remedies for include avoiding certain foods that ""trigger"" or worsen diarrhea, bloating, and gas, such as foods high in FODMAPs, such as:Cruciferous vegetables (for example, cauliflower, wasabi, kale, and broccoli)Legumes (for example, black beans, edamame, soy nuts, and fava beans)Dairy productsWheats and grains Home remedies for include avoiding certain foods that ""trigger"" or worsen diarrhea, bloating, and gas, such as foods high in FODMAPs, such as: Cruciferous vegetables (for example, cauliflower, wasabi, kale, and broccoli) Legumes (for example, black beans, edamame, soy nuts, and fava beans) Dairy products Wheats and grains Other home remedies to relieve symptoms of the condition include adding fiber to the diet, drinking plenty of water, avoiding soda, eating smaller meals, and eating more low fat and high carbohydrate foods. There is currently no known cure for IBS. Medical treatment for irritable bowel syndrome includes antispasmodic medicines, antidiarrheal medicines, antidepressants, laxatives, and other drugs. It is a chronic (long-term) disease, and symptoms usually recur. It also has been called spastic colon, functional bowel disease, and mucous colitis, although IBS is not a true ""colitis."" The term colitis refers to a different group of diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, microscopic colitis, and ischemic colitis."
What are the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome including IBS-D?,"'IBS'' affects each person differently. Some people have severe symptoms while others may be able to manage symptoms with only ''diet'' and lifestyle modification. The hallmark of IBS in adults and children is abdominal discomfort or ''pain''. The following signs and symptoms also are common:''Though not a symptom of the condition, ''indigestion'' affects up to 70% of people with IBS.''The following are NOT signs and symptoms or characteristics of IBS (but should still be brought to the attention of a health-care professional since they may be signs and symptoms of other conditions):'   Abdominal cramping and pain that is relieved with bowel movements Alternating periods of diarrhea and constipationThose who mostly have diarrhea as a symptom are considered to have IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), characterized by sudden urges to have bowel movements, along with loose stools, frequent stools, abdominal pain and discomfort, gas, and the feeling of being unable to completely empty the bowels. In severe cases of IBS-D, patients may lose control of their bowels.Those who mostly have constipation as a symptom are considered to have IBS with constipation (IBS-C), characterized by the passage of hard, lumpy stools, straining during bowel movements, and infrequent stools Those who mostly have diarrhea as a symptom are considered to have IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), characterized by sudden urges to have bowel movements, along with loose stools, frequent stools, abdominal pain and discomfort, gas, and the feeling of being unable to completely empty the bowels. In severe cases of IBS-D, patients may lose control of their bowels. Those who mostly have constipation as a symptom are considered to have IBS with constipation (IBS-C), characterized by the passage of hard, lumpy stools, straining during bowel movements, and infrequent stools Change in the stool frequency or consistency Gassiness (flatulence) Passing mucus from the rectum Bloating Abdominal distension Loss of appetite Blood in stools or urine Black or tarry stools Vomiting (rare, though may occasionally accompany nausea) Pain or diarrhea that interrupts sleep Fever Weight loss"
What are the risk factors for IBS-D?,"'Risk factors for IBS include:''Anxiety'' or ''depression'' may accompany the syndrome, though these have not been found to be a direct cause of it.' Abnormal (too fast or slow, or too strong) movements of the colon and small intestines Hypersensitivity to pain caused by gas or full bowels A viral or bacterial infection of the stomach and intestines (gastroenteritis) Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) Reproductive hormones or neurotransmitters may be off-balance in people with IBS."
What causes IBS-D?," IBS is not contagious, inherited, or cancerous. It occurs more often in women than in men, and the onset occurs before the age of 35 in about half of the cases. IBS occurs in 5% to 20% of children. IBS also has developed after episodes of gastroenteritis (""stomach flu""). It has been suggested that the condition is caused by dietary allergies or food sensitivities, but this has not been proven. Genetics also is suggested as a potential cause of IBS, but so far a hereditary link has not been found. Symptoms of the syndrome may worsen during periods of stress or during menstruation, but these factors are unlikely to be the cause that leads to the development of IBS."
When should you seek medical care if you think you have IBS-D?,"'If a person has any of the ''symptoms of IBS'' as discussed previously, or if a person with known IBS has unusual symptoms, a health-care professional should be consulted. Go to a hospital emergency department if problems are severe and/or come on suddenly.' "
Is there a test to diagnose IBS-D?,"'IBS can be difficult to diagnosis. It is called a diagnosis of exclusion, which means a doctor considers many other alternatives first, performing tests to rule out other medical problems. Some of these tests may include laboratory studies, imaging studies (such as a ''CT scan'' or small intestinal ''X-rays''), and ''endoscopy'' and/or ''colonoscopy''). An ''endoscopy'' is a procedure in which a flexible tube with a tiny camera at one end is passed into the GI tract while the patient is under conscious sedation. A combination of history, physical examination, and selected tests are used to help diagnose ''irritable bowel'' syndrome.''There are two relatively new blood tests that may help diagnose ''irritable bowel'' syndrome with diarrhea (''IBS-D'') and ''irritable bowel'' syndrome with diarrhea and ''constipation'' (''irritable bowel'' syndrome mixed IBS-M). These tests are for anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin antibodies that are thought to develop in some patients after an acute bout of stomach ''flu'' (gastroenteritis) caused by several different, common types of bacterium. The overgrowth of these bacteria in the gut may trigger an immune attack on an individual’s own intestinal tissues (autoimmunity) with the ensuing inflammation and damage to the tissues, which cause signs and symptoms of IBS.''The IBS tests may help distinguish between ''irritable bowel syndrome'' and a different type of bowel inflammatory disease, which includes ''ulcerative colitis'' and Crohn’s disease, called ''inflammatory bowel disease'' or ''IBD''. ''Irritable bowel syndrome'' and ''inflammatory bowel disease'' are two very different types of problems with the bowel and are not the same disease.''Both tests appear to be useful in the diagnosing patients with ''irritable bowel'' syndrome with diarrhea IBS-D, but not IBS with ''constipation'' (IBS-C). The tests also appear to be specific, and if the antibodies are present, it is highly likely that the patient has IBS-D or IBS-M. But the tests are insensitive, meaning if the antibodies are not present, the patient still may have IBS. Thus, the tests may be identifying only a subset of patients with IBS, those with post-infectious IBS. The tests have not undergone rigorous testing and have not yet been approved by the FDA. Both tests are expected to be expensive test, costing around $500 to over $1,000.' "
What medications treat  IBS-D?,"'Antispasmodic medicines, such as ''dicyclomine'' (Bemote, ''Bentyl'', Di-Spaz) and ''hyoscyamine'' (''Levsin'', Levbid, ''NuLev''), are sometimes used to treat ''symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome''. Antispasmodic medicines help slow the movements of the digestive tract and reduce the chance of spasms.''Antispasmodic drug side effects'' may include''Other treatment plans are available, depending on the symptoms and condition.''Antidiarrheal medicines, such as ''loperamide'' (''Imodium''), a kaolin/pectin preparation (''Kaopectate''), and diphenoxylate/''atropine'' (''Lomotil''), are sometimes used when diarrhea is a major symptom of the syndrome. Do not take these on a long-term basis without first consulting a health-care professional.''Antidiarrheal drug side effects'' may include''Antidepressants'' may be very effective in smaller doses than those typically used to treat ''depression''. ''Imipramine'' (''Tofranil''), ''amitriptyline'' (''Endep''), ''nortriptyline'' (''Pamelor''), and ''desipramine'' (''Norpramin'') are some commonly used medicines that may alleviate ''irritable bowel syndrome symptoms''. Some other antidepressants are more commonly prescribed when ''depression'' and IBS coexist.''Antidepressant'' side effects ''may include'   palpitations, constipation, difficulty urinating, dry mouth, and blurred vision. dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dry mouth, constipation, rash, and weight gain or loss."
Is there a specific diet for IBS-D?,"'Diet'' and lifestyle changes are important in decreasing the frequency and severity of the symptoms of the syndrome.''The first thing your doctor may suggest is to keep a food diary. This will help you figure out foods that trigger your symptoms.'   Limit foods that contain ingredients that can stimulate the intestines and cause diarrhea, such as:CaffeineAlcoholDairy productsFatty foodsFoods high in sugarArtificial sweeteners (sorbitol and xylitol) Caffeine Alcohol Dairy products Fatty foods Foods high in sugar Artificial sweeteners (sorbitol and xylitol) Some vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts) and legumes (beans) may worsen bloating and gassiness and should be avoided. A high fiber diet may lessen symptoms of constipation. Drink plenty of water, and avoid carbonated drinks such as soda, which may cause gas and discomfort. Eat smaller meals and eat slowly to help reduce cramping and diarrhea. Low fat, high carbohydrate meals such as pasta, rice, and whole-grain breads may help (unless you have celiac disease). Probiotic supplements such as lactobacillus acidophilus or prebiotics may help alleviate IBS symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating, and bowel movement irregularity. A diet low in FODMAPs (fermentable oligo-saccharides, di-saccharides, mono-saccharides, and polyols), a group of short-chain carbohydrates, may help relieve symptoms. Consult your health-care professional for more information."
What foods should you avoid if you have IBS-D or IBS-C?,"'Whether you have IBS-D or IBS-C, there are foods to avoid that may trigger symptoms.''Certain foods may worsen bloating and gassiness. Foods to avoid include cruciferous vegetables and legumes, such as:''Legumes also may worsen gassiness and bloating, for example:''Some foods may trigger symptoms of abdominal ''cramps'' and diarrhea, including:''Eating large meals also may trigger abdominal cramping and diarrhea.' Cabbage Cauliflower Radishes Horseradish Watercress Wasabi Brussels sprouts Bok choy Arugula Kale Broccoli Chinese cabbage Collard greens Black beans Black-eyed peas Chickpeas (garbanzo beans) Edamame Fava beans Lentils Lima beans Red kidney beans Soy nuts Fatty foods Fried foods Coffee Caffeine Alcohol Sorbitol (a sweetener found in many diet foods, candies, and gums) Fructose (found naturally in honey and some fruits, and also used as a sweetener)"
What home remedies and diet changes treat or soothe IBS-D symptoms?,"'Most people with the syndrome have symptoms only occasionally, and the following measures may treat or soothe symptoms during a flare.''Add fiber to the diet: ''Fiber theoretically expands the inside of the digestive tract, reducing the chance it will spasm as it transmits and digests food. Fiber also promotes regular bowel movements, which helps reduce constipation. Fiber should be added gradually, because it initially may worsen bloating and gassiness. If you have IBS-D, look for foods with more soluble fiber, the type that takes longer to digest (such as that found in oats, beans, barley, peas, apples, carrots, and citrus fruits).''Reduce ''stress'' and ''anxiety'': ''Stress'' and ''anxiety'' may cause ""flares."" Health-care professionals may offer specific advice on reducing ''stress''. These tips may help reduce stress and problems associated with IBS:''Other home remedies to soothe and lessen symptoms include:' Eat regular balanced meals. Reduce caffeine intake. Exercise may help reduce stress. Smoking may worsen symptoms of the syndrome, which is another good reason to quit. Increase fiber in the diet Drink plenty of water Avoid soda, which may cause gas and abdominal discomfort Eat smaller meals to help lessen the incidence of cramping and diarrhea. Low fat and high carbohydrate meals such as pasta, rice, and whole grain breads may help IBS symptoms (unless you have celiac disease)."
What other lifestyle changes help soothe IBS-D symptoms?,"'In addition to dietary changes, there are some healthy habits that may also help reduce IBS symptoms.' Maintain good physical fitness to improve bowel function and help reduce stress. Exercise regularly. Stop smoking for overall good health. Avoid coffee/caffeine and chewing gum.

What new medications are being developed or are in clinical trials to treat IBS-D?,"'New medications for IBS-D are also being developed or are in ''clinical trials''. Those that are most promising include:' Serotonin synthesis inhibitors may help reduce pain and improve stool consistency Ramosetron is similar to alosetron (Lotronex), this is reported to relieve symptoms with less constipation Spherical carbon adsorbent offers short-term relief from pain and bloating, but no improvement in stool consistency Benzodiazepine receptor modulator (dextofisopam): this has the potential to reduce colonic motility and gut sensitivity reactions in response to stress Peripheral k-agonist (asimadoline, a kappa-opioid agonist) is in clinical trials and it shows reduced pain, urgency and stool frequency"
What medications are reserved for people that do not improve with standard IBS-D drugs?,"'The following medications are typically reserved for patients with symptoms that do not improve with the previously mentioned treatments:' Alosetron (Lotronex) is a restricted drug approved only for short-term treatment of women with severe, chronic, diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) who have failed to respond to conventional IBS therapy. Fewer than 5% of people with irritable bowel syndrome have the severe form, and only a fraction of people with severe IBS have the diarrhea-predominant type. Alosetron was removed from the United States market but was reintroduced with new restrictions approved by the FDA in 2002. Physicians must be registered with the pharmaceutical manufacturer in order to prescribe the medication. Serious and unpredictable gastrointestinal side effects (including some that resulted in death) were reported in association with its use following its original approval. The safety and efficacy of alosetron has not been sufficiently studied in men; therefore, the FDA has not approved the drug for treatment of IBS in men. Rifaximin (Xifaxan) is an antibiotic medication for IBS-D that works by reducing or altering gut bacteria, and it can improve symptoms of bloating and diarrhea after a 10 to 14 day course of treatment. Some patients require retreatment at higher doses for symptom relief. Eluxadoline (Viberzi) is another newer medication for IBS-D that helps reduce abdominal pain and improves stool consistency in adults. Linaclotide (Linzess) is a kind of drug that relieves constipation and pain for some adults with the syndrome. In drug trials, people with IBS-C had more frequent and better bowel movements and less abdominal pain after taking daily doses of Linzess. The drug often began working within the first few days of treatment. Lubiprostone (Amitiza) is a type of laxative used to treat severe IBS-C in women who are at least 18 years of age. It is a capsule taken orally, twice a day with food. It is used to relieve stomach pain, bloating, and straining; and produce softer and more frequent bowel movements in people who have chronic idiopathic constipation. Tegaserod (Zelnorm) was a medication used to treat IBS but was removed from the market in 2007 due to increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and ischemic colitis."
Which specialties of doctors treats IBS-D?,"'Irritable bowel'' syndrome may initially be diagnosed by your primary care provider such as your family doctor, internist, or family medicine specialist. A ''gastroenterologist'' (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the ''digestive system'') usually will provide further treatment. An ''emergency medicine'' specialist may be seen if you have an acute flare-up of symptoms of the condition.' "
What are the complications of IBS-D?,"'IBS has few associated complications. It does not lead to ''rectal bleeding'', ''colon cancer'', or ''inflammatory bowel diseases'' including ''ulcerative colitis''. Diarrhea and constipation may aggravate ''hemorrhoids'' in people who already have them. If a person eliminates too many foods from their diet, and the diet is too limited in nutrients that could cause health problems.'""The effect on a person's quality of life is the biggest complication of IBS. Stress and ""'anxiety'"" can result from the pain, and can impact a person's daily life."" "
Can IBS-D be prevented?,"'Follow the diet and lifestyle recommendations as outlined in this article, and as discussed with your health-care professional. Avoiding triggers is the best way to prevent symptoms of IBS.' "
What is the outlook for a person with IBS-D?,"'Because ''irritable bowel'' syndrome is a chronic (long-term) disease, symptoms usually return from time to time. This may be influenced by factors such as stress, diet, or other environmental causes. No known treatment cures IBS. Multiple factors may play a role in aggravating the syndrome, so it is difficult to predict what triggers may make it worse in a particular person. Establishing a good relationship with a health-care professional may help alleviate concerns over symptoms and allow rapid recognition of changing or worsening symptoms.' "
What is travelers' diarrhea?,"""Travelers' diarrhea is defined by most experts as three or more unformed stools in a 24 hour time period, passed by a person who is traveling. Travelers' diarrhea is commonly accompanied by abdominal cramps, ""'nausea'', and ''bloating''. Travelers\' diarrhea is a general term and does not specify any cause. Travelers\' from temperate regions of the world frequently experience diarrhea four days to two weeks after arriving in certain other areas of the world. Other terms used to describe this illness include ""Montezuma\'s Revenge,"" the ""Aztec Two Step,"" and ""Turista"" in Mexico, the ""Delhi Belly"" in India, and the ""Hong Kong Dog"" in the Far East.' "
How common is travelers' diarrhea?,"'Twenty percent to 50 percent of international travelers may develop diarrhea depending on the region of the world they visit. Diarrhea is the most common illness of travelers, affecting 10 million people each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In general, travelers at risk for diarrhea commonly come from industrialized nations and travel to high-risk areas that are primarily within developing or less industrialized nations of the world, including Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Areas of lesser risk include China and some Caribbean nations. Travel to areas of the United States, Canada, Northern Europe, and Australia pose the lowest risk to travelers.'""Men and women are at equal risk for developing travelers' diarrhea. Younger individuals are more commonly afflicted, perhaps because of more adventurous eating habits. People with disorders that compromise their immune system (such as ""'HIV'', ''cancer'', ''chemotherapy'', steroid use), people with ''diabetes'', and people with underlying abdominal disorders (''irritable bowel syndrome'', ''colitis'"") are more susceptible to travelers' diarrhea. People taking acid blockers for their stomachs (for example, ""'famotidine'' [''Pepcid''], ''cimetidine'' [''Tagamet''], ''omeprazole'' [''Prilosec''], ''esomeprazole'' [''Nexium'""]) also have a higher susceptibility to travelers' diarrhea because they have less stomach acid to protect them from the bacteria that cause the condition."" "
What causes travelers' diarrhea?,"""Travelers' diarrhea usually is contracted by the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Contrary to common belief, food - not water - is the primary cause. The CDC estimates up to 80% of cases of travelers' diarrhea are caused by bacteria. The most common bacterium that causes travelers' diarrhea is enterotoxigenic ""'E. coli'','' one of six classes of enterovirulent ''E. coli''.''Most ''E. coli'' are harmless. However, there are six unique classes of ''E. coli'' that can cause inflammation of the stomach and bowels (''gastroenteritis'') and are termed enterovirulent. They are virulent (extremely noxious) to the intestine (or, in Greek, the enteron).''Collectively, these six classes of enterovirulent ''E. coli'' are referred to as the ''EEC'' group (enterovirulent ''E. coli''). Each class of EEC is distinct and different from the others.'""Other bacterial species implicated in travelers' diarrhea include""' Campylobacter jejuni'', ''Shigella'', and '' ''Salmonella''. Viruses (including ''Rotavirus'"", Norwalk virus and other enteric viruses) less commonly are causes of travelers' diarrhea. Parasitic infections are an uncommon cause with the exception of ""' ''Giardia lamblia'', which should be suspected in individuals traveling to Russia or to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. ''Cryptosporidum'', another parasite, also has been implicated as a common cause of diarrhea in visitors to St. Petersburg, Russia and elsewhere.' Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) invades (passes into) the intestinal wall to produce severe diarrhea. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) is a type of EHEC, E.coli 0157:H7 that can cause bloody diarrhea and the hemolytic uremic syndrome (anemia and kidney failure). Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is the one that causes most of travelers' diarrhea, and produces a toxin that acts on the intestinal lining. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) can cause diarrhea outbreaks in newborn nurseries. Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) invade the epithelial cells causing diarrhea with mucus and blood. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAggEC) can cause acute and chronic (long lasting) diarrhea in children."
What are the symptoms of travelers' diarrhea?,"""The symptoms of travelers' diarrhea vary. Generally, diarrhea occurs within the first week of travel and lasts up to three to four days. Affected individuals on average pass up to five loose or watery bowel movements per day, which may be associated with cramps. On occasion, individuals may experience ""'fever'' or bloody stools. The diarrhea may be accompanied by ''abdominal pain'' and cramping, bloating, or increase in stomach or intestinal noises or gurgling (borborygmi).' "
How is travelers' diarrhea diagnosed?,"""The presumptive diagnosis of travelers' diarrhea is based solely on the development of diarrhea when visiting a part of the world where this condition is common among travelers.  The diarrhea usually is mild, self-limited, and resolves spontaneously. Symptoms usually can be controlled with over-the-counter medications  (see below.)  Only when the diarrhea is severe or complicated, and possibly when antibiotics are contemplated, should attempts be made to identify the exact organism responsible for the diarrhea so that the correct drug therapy can be selected.  Identification may be difficult or impossible in undeveloped countries because of the lack of medical laboratories. When laboratories are available, the ""'stool'' can be examined for parasites and cultured for bacteria. Identification of the pathogen results in the definitive diagnosis.' "
How is travelers' diarrhea treated?,"""Although prophylactic antibiotics (antibiotics taken before the person is exposed to the pathogen) are effective in preventing travelers' diarrhea, they generally are not recommended. The side effects of antibiotics, including ""'photosensitivity'' (sensitivity to the sun that results in injury to the skin) and additional diarrhea can be major problems. Antibiotic prophylaxis can be considered in individuals with underlying medical diseases in whom diarrhea is more likely to occur or who may be profoundly affected by the diarrhea. This group includes people with previous stomach surgery, active ''inflammatory bowel disease'', underlying immunodeficiency conditions, and other serious medical disorders. In these situations ''drugs'' of the quinolone class (''ciprofloxacin'' [''Cipro'', ''Cipro XR'', Proquin XR], ''levofloxacin'' [''Levaquin'']) have been shown to be effective.''Bismuth subsalicylate (''Pepto-Bismol'') in liquid or pill form also has been shown to be effective in preventing diarrhea in up to 65% of travelers although Pepto-Bismol may cause ''black stools'' and, rarely, ''ringing in the ears''. People ''allergic'' to ''aspirin'' should avoid Pepto-Bismol.''When treating afflicted individuals, drugs that alleviate symptoms as well as antibiotics play a role. With moderate symptoms, the addition of Pepto-Bismol alone may suffice. Alternatively, anti-diarrheal agents such as ''diphenoxylate and atropine'' (''Lomotil'') or ''loperamide'' (''Imodium'') can be given. With severe disease, characterized by frequent diarrhea or ''dehydration'', or complicated by the passage of bloody stools, Lomotil or Imodium should not be used and you should consult your doctor.''Oral fluids are a mainstay of therapy since they are important to prevent ''dehydration''. Tips for staying hydrated are:''Children and the elderly are more susceptible to dehydration. If a person feels light-headed or woozy, feels a rapid pulse or their mouth and lips are dry, they should consult a physician. If a child is listless, not eating or drinking and does not make wet diapers or urinate within a few hours, they also should be seen quickly by a doctor.'   Small, frequent sips of clear liquids (those you can see through) are the best way to stay hydrated. Avoid alcoholic, caffeinated, or sugary drinks, if possible. Over-the-counter rehydration products made for children such as Pedialyte and Rehydralyte are expensive but good to use if available. Sports drinks such as Gatorade and PowerAde are fine for adults if they are diluted with water because at full strength they contain too much sugar, which can worsen diarrhea. Try to drink at least as much or more fluid than you think is coming out or lost with the watery diarrhea. For mild to moderate dehydration, oral rehydration salts (ORS) may be recommended. These are available in pharmacies in most developing countries. Severe hydration usually requires emergent intravenous rehydration (IV). If the affected individual cannot hold down fluids, or is losing fluids faster than they can take them in, seek medical care immediately, because some patients will require IV hydration."
What is the prognosis for travelers' diarrhea?,"""The prognosis for travelers' diarrhea is usually good. Most cases resolve within 2 days without treatment. The CDC estimates 90% of cases resolve within one week, and 98% resolve within one month. Travelers' diarrhea is rarely fatal.  "" "
How can travelers' diarrhea be prevented?,"'Since food is the major source of infection, close attention to ''diet'"" is of foremost importance in the prevention of travelers' diarrhea. Foods should be well-cooked and served warm. Raw vegetables, uncooked meat or seafood, and other foods maintained at room temperature should be avoided. Dairy products, tap water and ice (including frozen drinks not made from filtered water) are also high-risk foods. Carbonated ""'beverages'', beer and wine, hot coffee and tea, fruits that can be peeled, and canned products generally are safe. The risk for developing diarrhea increases when eating at ''restaurants'"" and when purchasing food from street vendors.  Also, frequent hand washing with soap and clean water will decrease the likelihood of the bacteria's spread, especially to other people that the person may be traveling with. ""'Antibiotics can be effective in preventing travelers\' diarrhea, but are not recommended for most people due to possible side effects (see ""How is Travelers\' Diarrhea Treated?""). ''Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) also can be effective in preventing diarrhea in travelers although Pepto-Bismol may cause ''black stools'' and, rarely, ''ringing in the ears''. People allergic to aspirin should avoid Pepto-Bismol. Studies have not shown bismuth subsalicylate to be safe for use longer than three weeks. ''Probiotics'' such as ''Lactobacillus'' '""have shown inconclusive results in prevention of travelers' diarrhea."" "
What is cholesterol?,"   Cholesterol is a chemical compound that is naturally produced by the body and is structurally a combination of fat (lipid) and steroid. Cholesterol is a building block for cell membranes and for hormones, for example, estrogen and testosterone. The liver produces about 80% of the body's cholesterol, while the rest comes from our diet. The main sources of dietary cholesterol are meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products. Organ meats, such as liver, are especially high in cholesterol content, while foods of plant origin contain no cholesterol. After a meal, dietary cholesterol is absorbed from the intestine and stored in the liver. The liver is able to regulate cholesterol levels in the bloodstream and can secrete cholesterol if the body needs it."
"What are ""normal"" cholesterol blood levels?","'There are no established ""normal"" blood levels for total and LDL cholesterol. In most other blood tests in medicine, normal ranges can be set by taking measurements from large number of healthy subjects. The normal range of LDL cholesterol among ""healthy"" adults (adults with no known coronary ''heart disease'') in the United States may be too high. The atherosclerosis process may be quietly progressing in many healthy children and adults with average LDL cholesterol blood levels, putting them at risk of developing coronary ''heart disease'' in the future.' "
What are HDL cholesterol (good) vs. LDL cholesterol (bad)? What do they do?," LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein) is called ""bad"" cholesterol because elevated levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. LDL lipoprotein deposits cholesterol along the inside of artery walls, causing the formation of a hard, thick substance called cholesterol plaque. Over time, cholesterol plaque causes thickening of the artery walls and narrowing of the lumen of the arteries, a process called atherosclerosis, which decreases blood flow through the narrowed plaque-filled vessel. Narrowing of blood vessels in the heart may lead to angina (a type of chest pain) or heart attack. Narrowing of blood vessels in the brain may cause a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. Narrowing of the arteries throughout the body (peripheral artery disease) can lead to signs and symptoms of pain, including in the intestine (mesenteric ischemia) and in the legs with walking (claudication). HDL cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein) is called the ""good cholesterol"" because HDL cholesterol particles prevent atherosclerosis by extracting cholesterol from the artery walls and disposing of them through the liver. High levels of LDL cholesterol and low levels of HDL cholesterol (high LDL/HDL ratios) are risk factors for atherosclerosis and heart attacks Low levels of LDL cholesterol and high levels of HDL cholesterol (low LDL/HDL ratios) are desirable and protect against heart disease and stroke. Very low and very high HDL cholesterol levels can run in families. Families with low HDL cholesterol levels have a higher incidence of heart attacks than the general population, while families with high HDL cholesterol levels tend to live longer with a lower frequency of heart attacks. LDL cholesterol, lifestyle factors, and other conditions influence HDL cholesterol levels. HDL cholesterol levels tend to be lower in persons who smoke cigarettes or have type 2 diabetes and in those who are overweight or inactive. HDL cholesterol is higher in people who are lean, exercise regularly, and do not smoke cigarettes. Estrogen increases a person's HDL cholesterol, which explains why women generally have higher HDL levels than men do. The combination of low levels of total and LDL cholesterol and high levels of HDL cholesterol is favorable. Total cholesterol is the sum of LDL (low-density) cholesterol, HDL (high-density) cholesterol, VLDL (very low-density) cholesterol, and IDL (intermediate density) cholesterol. The liver manufactures and secretes LDL cholesterol into the blood. It also removes LDL cholesterol from the blood by active LDL receptors on the surface of its cells. A decrease in the number of liver cell LDL receptors is associated with high LDL cholesterol blood levels. Both heredity and diet have a significant influence on a person's LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol levels. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (an inherited form of very high cholesterol in the blood) is a disorder in which patients have a diminished number or nonexistent LDL receptors on the surface of liver cells. People with this disorder also tend to develop atherosclerosis and heart attacks during early adulthood. Diets that are high in saturated fats and cholesterol raise the levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood. Fats are classified as saturated or unsaturated (according to their chemical structure). Saturated fats are derived primarily from meat and dairy products and can raise blood cholesterol levels. Some vegetable oils made from coconut, palm, and cocoa are high in saturated fats."
What are the cholesterol guidelines to prevent heart attack and stroke,"'The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have guidelines to help health-care professionals counsel patients on how to decrease the risk of suffering a heart attack or ''stroke''. Since it takes years for cholesterol plaque to narrow arteries enough to cause blood flow problems, there is opportunity to intervene early to stop the progression of this narrowing.''In addition to controlling cholesterol, the guidelines ''stress'' lifelong control of ''high blood pressure'' and ''diabetes'', and the new guidelines ''stress'':''The previous goal of maintaining ""normal"" cholesterol levels has been replaced by an approach that suggests more people may benefit from cholesterol-lowering statin medications, and not just those with ''high cholesterol'' levels. These four groups include patients:'""The goal for statin therapy is to decrease the LDL blood levels. In patients' prescribed high intensity statin therapy, the goal is to lower LDL levels by 50%. For those who have medium intensity statin therapy, the goal is a LDL reduction of 30% to 50%."" Weight control Diet Exercise Mandatory smoking cessation With known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) With LDL cholesterol levels (the ""bad"" cholesterol) higher than 190 mg/dL With diabetes and without ASCVD, aged 40-75 whose LDL cholesterol is between 70-189 mg/dL Without diabetes or ASCVD with a 10-year risk of developing heart disease that is greater than 7.5%. An online calculator from the American Heart Association may be used to help predict this risk"
What are LDL/HDL and total/HDL ranges and ratios?,"'The'' total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio (total chol/HDL) ''is a number helpful in estimating the risk of developing atherosclerosis. The number is obtained by dividing total cholesterol by HDL cholesterol. (High ratios indicate a higher risk of ''heart attacks'', whereas low ratios indicate a lower risk).''High total cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol increases the ratio and is undesirable. Conversely, high HDL cholesterol and low total cholesterol lowers the ratio and is desirable. Ideally, one should strive for ratios of 2 or 3 (less than 4).' "
How can levels of HDL cholesterol be increased?," The first step in increasing HDL cholesterol levels (and decreasing LDL/HDL ratios) is by implementing and maintaining therapeutic life style changes. Regular aerobic exercise, loss of excess weight (fat), and smoking cessation will increase HDL cholesterol levels. Regular alcohol consumption in moderation (such as one drink a day) will also raise HDL cholesterol. Because of other adverse health consequences of excessive alcohol consumption, alcohol is not recommended as a standard treatment for low HDL cholesterol."
"How can high LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol levels be lowered?","'“It must be emphasized that lifestyle modification (i.e., adhering to a heart healthy ''diet'', regular ''exercise'' habits, avoidance of tobacco products, and maintenance of a healthy weight) remains a critical component of health promotion and ASCVD risk reduction, both prior to and in concert with the use of cholesterol-lowering drug therapies.”''- 2013 ''ACC''/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults''Newer medications, PCSK9 protein antibodies, Alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha) are potentially useful in treating certain patients where diet and ''statins'' have failed to adequately lower LDL level.'   Therapeutic lifestyle changes to lower LDL cholesterol can help lower and maintain levels naturally. This may involve:Excess weight lossGetting regular exerciseEating a heart healthy diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol Excess weight loss Getting regular exercise Eating a heart healthy diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol Medications to lower cholesterol: Medications are prescribed when lifestyle changes cannot reduce the LDL cholesterol to desired levels. The most effective and widely used medications to lower LDL cholesterol are called statins. Research has shown that only these statin drugs have a proven benefit to decrease the risk of heart attack and stroke. Other medications prescribed to lower cholesterol profiles include fibrates such as gemfibrozil (Lopid), resins such as cholestyramine (Questran), and ezetimibe (Zetia)."
14 Foods that help lower cholesterol levels,"'A healthy diet that minimizes cholesterol intake is a good first step in using food to decrease cholesterol levels in the blood. Extra lean meats, skim milk, and vegetable-based ""butter-like"" substitutes may help decrease LDL levels in the bloodstream.''In addition to diet, exercise, and ''weight loss'', there are foods that may help in lowering and rebalancing the cholesterol -- increasing HDL (the good) and decreasing LDL (the bad).''Increasing soluble ''fiber'' in the diet helps decrease both total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Sources include:''Nuts are healthy. Nuts that may be helpful in ''lowering cholesterol'' levels include:''However, nuts are high in calories and should be eaten in moderation. Avoid nuts covered with salt or ''sugar''.' Oatmeal Oat bran Avariety of vegetables and fruits, for example, apples, pears, and prunes The goal for consumption of dietary fiber is 5 to 10 grams of soluble fiber a day (a cup of oatmeal has 4 grams of fiber and an apple contains 3 grams). Olive oil acts as an antioxidant to decrease LDL levels and does not affect levels of good HDL cholesterol. Foods fortified with plant sterols and stanols decrease cholesterol absorption in the intestine. They can be found in cereal, margarines, and yogurts. Read labels to discover which foods are fortified with these beneficial plant compounds. Sterols and stanols may also be found as a dietary supplement. Soy and foods containing soy products may help decrease LDL levels. Almonds Hazelnuts Peanuts Pecans Pine nuts Pistachios Walnuts Certain fish contain omega-3 fatty acids that lower cholesterol levels. The American Heart Association recommends at least 2 to 3 servings per week in the diet. Fatty fish that are helpful include salmon, halibut, mackerel, trout, herring, and sardines. It's best to grill or bake fish and to avoid frying."
"What medications lower cholesterol, lipids, and triglycerides?","'Lipid-altering medications are used to lower blood levels of undesirable ''lipids'' such as LDL cholesterol and ''triglycerides'' and increase blood levels of desirable ''lipids'' such as HDL cholesterol. Several classes of medications are available in the United States, including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), nicotinic acid, fibric acid derivatives, and medications that decrease intestinal cholesterol absorption (''bile acid sequestrants'' and cholesterol absorption inhibitors). Some of these medications are primarily useful in lowering LDL cholesterol, others in lowering ''triglycerides'', and some in elevating HDL cholesterol. Medications also can be combined to more aggressively lower LDL, as well as lower LDL and increase HDL at the same time.''Newer medications, alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha) have been approved to help lower LDL levels in certain pateints where diet and other statin medications have not worked adequately.''Note: Dosing guidelines change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a guideline concerning the potential dangers of taking the 80 mg dose of ''simvastatin'' (''Zocor'').'  "
Is lowering LDL cholesterol enough?,"'The reduction of LDL cholesterol is only part of the battle against atherosclerosis. Individuals who have normal or only mildly elevated LDL cholesterol levels can still develop atherosclerosis and heart attacks even in the absence of other risk factors such as ''cigarette smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', and ''diabetes''.' "
Does lowering LDL cholesterol prevent heart attacks and strokes?,"'The benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol are:''The same measures that decrease narrowing in coronary arteries also may benefit the large arteries in the neck and brain (carotid and cerebral arteries) as well as the femoral arteries that supply blood to the legs and the arteries that supply blood to the intestine.' Reduces or stops the formation of new cholesterol plaques on the artery walls Reduces existing cholesterol plaques on the artery walls and widening the arteries Prevents the rupture of cholesterol plaques, which initiates blood clot formation and blocks blood vessels causing heart attack or stroke Decreases the risk of heart attacks Decreases the risk of strokes Decreases the risk of peripheral artery disease"
What are triglycerides and VLDL?,"'Triglyceride is a fatty substance that is composed of three fatty acids. Like cholesterol, triglyceride in the blood comes either from the diet or the liver. In addition, like cholesterol, triglyceride cannot dissolve and circulate in the blood without combining with a lipoprotein.''The liver removes triglyceride from the blood and it synthesizes and packages triglyceride into VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) particles and releases them back into the blood circulation.' "
What causes elevated triglyceride levels?,"'High triglyceride blood levels (hypertriglyceridemia) may be genetic or they may be acquired. Examples of ''inherited'' hypertriglyceridemia disorders include mixed hypertriglyceridemia, familial hypertriglyceridemia, and familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.''Hypertriglyceridemia can often be caused by nongenetic factors such as ''obesity'', excessive alcohol intake, ''diabetes mellitus'', ''kidney disease'', and estrogen-containing medications such as ''birth control pills''.' "
Do high triglyceride levels cause atherosclerosis?,"'Whether elevated ''triglyceride levels'' in the blood lead to atherosclerosis and heart attacks is controversial. While abnormally high ''triglyceride levels'' may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis, it is difficult to conclusively prove that elevated triglyceride by itself can cause atherosclerosis. Elevated ''triglyceride levels'' are often associated with other conditions that increase the risk of atherosclerosis including ''obesity''; low levels of HDL cholesterol; ''insulin resistance''; poorly-controlled ''diabetes''; and small, dense LDL cholesterol particles.' "
How can elevated blood triglyceride levels be treated?,"'Diet is the first step in treating hypertriglyceridemia. A low-fat diet, regular ''aerobic exercise'', loss of excess weight, reduction of alcohol consumption, and stopping ''cigarette smoking'' may be enough to control ''triglyceride levels'' in the blood. In patients with diabetes, meticulous control of elevated blood glucose is also important. This can be monitored by measuring the hemoblobin A1c levels in the blood.''When medications are necessary, ''fibrates'' (such as ''gemfibrozil'' [''Lopid'']), nicotinic acid, and statin medications can be used. Lopid not only decreases triglyceride levels but also increases HDL cholesterol levels and LDL cholesterol particle size. Nicotinic acid lowers triglyceride levels and increases HDL cholesterol levels and the size of LDL cholesterol particles.''Statins are effective for decreasing triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels and, to a lesser extent, elevating HDL cholesterol levels.'  "
What is a diabetic diet?,"'A diabetes meal plan (diabetes diet) is a nutritional guide for people with diabetes that helps them decide when to consume meals and snacks as well as what type of foods to eat. There is no one predetermined diabetes diet that works for all people with diabetes. The goal of any diabetic meal plan is to achieve and maintain good control over the disease, including control of blood glucose and blood ''lipid'' levels as well as to maintaining a healthy weight andgood ''nutrition''.''Health care professionals and nutritionists can offer advice to help you create the best meal plan to manage your diabetes. Nutritionists can help you find ''recipes'' and ''cooking tips'' to help with meal planning and preparation.' "
Are there diabetic diet guidelines?,"'There is no single diabetic diet that is appropriate for all people with type 2, gestational, or ''type 1 diabetes'' just as there is no single medication regimen that is appropriate for everyone with this disease. Dietary choices depends upon many factors including your age and gender, overall ''exercise'' and activity level, any medications you may be taking (including ''insulin'' or others), and whether or not you are trying to ''lose weight'', among other factors.''Some meal planning tools and guidelines include: ''Most doctors and health care professionals agree that patients with diabetes can eat most of the same foods and meals as the rest of the family with some added attention to timing of meals and portion sizes. As in any healthy diet, it is best to consume a variety of foods. There are numerous recipes and apps if you need ideas for healthy foods to eat.''Healthy eating includes eating a wide variety of foods including:''One example of a diabetic meal plan for people who also have elevated ''cholesterol levels'' is known as the TLC (Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes) plan. This meal plan is designed to help you manage your disease and by lowering your cholesterol level and helping you lose weight. The TLC diet is defined as follows:' The plate method (MyPlate) Glycemic index Counting carbohydrates  Vegetables Whole grains Fruits Non-fat dairy products Beans Lean meats, poultry, and fish Limit fat to 25%-35% of total daily 
calories, getting no more than 7% of your daily calories from saturated fat, 10% 
or less from
	polyunsaturated fats, and up to 20% from monounsaturated fats (like 
plant oils or nuts). Carbohydrates should account for no more than 50%-60% of 
your daily calories. Try to eat 20-30 grams of fiber each 
day. Allow 15%-20% of your daily calories 
for protein. Limit cholesterol to 200 milligrams 
per day."
"How many carbs, fats, and proteins can I eat on a healthy diabetic meal plan?","'The number of carbohydrates (carbs), fats, and proteins in your plan will depend upon the ideal number of calories you should consume each day. Your age, gender, the amount of exercise you get, and your activity level affect the number of calories you need to eat in order to gain, lose, or maintain a healthy weight.''A high-fiber diet has been shown to improve blood sugar and cholesterol levels in people with ''type 2 diabetes''. Fiber can be found in many foods, especially whole grains, beans, vegetables, nuts, and fruits. ' "
Can I have sugar on a diabetic meal plan?,"'Most doctors and other medical or health care professional believe that people on a diabetic diet can have small amounts of sugar, so long as they are part of a healthy and balanced ''nutrition'' strategy. Table sugar does not raise blood glucose more than starches.' "
Can I have alcohol on a diabetic diet?,"'It may be OK for some people with diabetes to drink alcohol in moderation. It is best to drink alcohol when your blood sugar levels are under good control, and it is important to remember that wine and mixed ''drinks'' contain sugar, and alcohol has a lot of calories. Your doctor or health care professional can tell you if alcohol can be a safe part of your meal plan.' "
What foods raise blood sugar levels?,"'The extent to which carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels is known as their glycemic index. ''High glycemic index foods'' raise glucose levels faster and to a greater degree than ''low glycemic index foods''. ''High glycemic index foods include:' White bread, bagels Short-grain white rice Corn flakes or puffed rice cereal  Russet potatoes Saltine crackers, pretzels, rice cakes Pumpkin Melons Pineapple Popcorn"
What foods help maintain good blood sugar levels?,"'These foods can fill you up without dramatic rises in blood glucose levels, for example:''Proteins and fiber can also help you feel full without raising blood sugar levels as much as carbohydrates.' 100% stone-ground whole wheat or

What is IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)?,"'Irritable bowel'' syndrome (''IBS'') is a chronic relapsing gastrointestinal (mainly the ''large intestine'' or colon) disorder with signs and symptoms that may include:''IBS'' is a chronic condition that can be triggered by ''diet'', medications and/or by other conditions such as ''stress''.''Some health care professionals categorize and term ''IBS'' into one of four categories:''Not all health care professionals recognize these four categories.' Abdominal cramping or pain Bloating Mucus in the stool Gassiness Altered bowel habits (alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation) IBS-D (predominant symptoms is diarrhea) IBS-C (predominant symptoms is constipation) IBS-M (mixed diarrhea and constipation) IBS-U (unclassified)"
Are stress and anxiety triggers for IBS?,"'Stress'' and ''anxiety'' may be triggers for IBS and the development of recurrent symptoms. Chronic stress experienced early in life (less than age 18) may increase the chances of developing the condition. Moreover, people diagnosed with IBS can have stress or ''anxiety'' trigger symptoms, such as:'   Diarrhea Constipation Abdominal bloating Mucus defecation Feelings of incomplete bowel movements"
Are menstrual pain and IBS related?,"'Some studies show that many women with IBS have worse symptoms during their menstrual periods. Although the mechanism is not clear, some gastrointestinal cells have receptors for estrogen and ''progesterone'' so that changes in the hormone levels during the ''menstrual cycle'' may trigger increasing ''IBS symptoms''. Women are twice as likely to develop IBS as men.' "
What foods in the diet trigger constipation in IBS?,"'Any foods or fluids that tend to dehydrate a person are likely to trigger ''constipation'' in people with ''irritable bowel'' syndrome. Foods that may promote constipation should be avoided in an IBS ''diet'' and include:''Foods that help prevent constipation and should be included in an IBS ''diet'' include:'   Chocolate Dairy products such as milk and cheese (particularly those that contain lactose) Red meat Unripe bananas Items that contain caffeine if you are slightly dehydrated. Coffee, carbonated drinks and alcohol may lead to dehydration and constipation in IBS patients (and other people, too). Prunes Various types of beans Whole grain breads like rye bread Pears and fruits like kiwi Vegetables that will help boost fiber intake"
What foods in the diet trigger diarrhea in IBS?,"   Several foods may play a role in developing diarrhea in people with IBS. Major categories of foods that may trigger IBS are those that contain fats (fatty meats, fatty dairy products, for example). Each individual is slightly different and may respond differently to food types. Consequently, dietitians and health care professionals who treat people with IBS often suggest that they keep a journal or diary to track those foods that cause diarrhea. Some foods that trigger diarrhea do so because they are ingested in large quantities; for example, a bite of a banana may not cause diarrhea, but eating a whole banana may trigger diarrhea in some people with IBS. Other foods that contain high levels of fructose, artificial sweeteners, high FODMAP foods, and fried foods may also trigger diarrhea. Broccoli, onions, cabbage and large helpings of beans may produce gas and increase the discomfort of diarrhea. Probiotics may help reduce the symptoms of diarrhea and gas in some individuals."
What prescription or OTC drugs trigger IBS?,"'Some ''drugs'' can trigger ''IBS symptoms'' resulting in colonic spasms, constipation and/or diarrhea. Such drugs include antibiotics (especially those administered over a long period of time), ''tricyclic antidepressants'', for example, ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil'', ''Endep''), ''nortriptyline'' (''Pamelor''), and ''doxepin'', and medicines containing ''sorbitol'' (for example, some ''cough'' syrup preparations and common ''pain'' medicines like ''Advil'' gel capsules). Consequently, patients with the condition should check the ingredients, both active and inactive, for the presence of sorbitol as sorbitol is often listed as an ""inactive"" ingredient.' "
What are the other IBS triggers?,"'Other triggers of IBS are variable and differ from person to person. However, some other common triggers include:''Keep a journal and record the symptoms and the activities you are doing when symptoms develop. This can help you determine your personal triggers for any symptoms. Researchers also suggest that changes in hormone levels and/or other acute illnesses such as infectious diarrhea may also trigger symptoms.'""Although a patient's primary care physician may care for IBS patients, specialists in gastroenterology, immunology, psychiatry and dietary professionals may be consulted to help patients manage the condition.""   Lack of exercise Eating foods too quickly Eating while under some other stress such as driving or working Eating foods that are very hot or cold Chewing gum"
How can I prevent IBS triggers?,"'There are many different ways to help prevent triggering IBS symptoms such as:' Eat a balanced diet with a moderate amount of fiber. Avoid extremes of food temperatures (very hot or cold foods). Do not eat while experiencing anxiety or under stressful conditions (for example, while working or driving). Avoid foods and drinks that may cause dehydration or diarrhea. Keep a journal to help identify those foods that do or do not trigger symptoms. Try biofeedback, exercise, meditation, or yoga to reduce anxiety. Discuss medications you are taking that may be triggering symptoms with your doctor. Avoid those foods and drinks that are likely to increase or trigger symptoms. Avoid foods that increase intestinal gas (some legumes and vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts). Talk to your doctor or health care professional about taking probiotics."
How do weight loss medications work?,"'Weight loss'' medications may act through any or more of the various mechanisms:' Reducing appetite, for example, phentermine (Adipex-P, Ionamin, Pro-Fast) Increasing satiety, for example, liraglutide (Saxenda) Preventing absorption of fats from the gut, for example, orlistat (Alli, Xenical) Certain combination drugs work by increasing satiety and altering the food taste, such as phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia) Certain combination drugs work by altering brain chemicals, such as naltrexone-bupropion (Contrave)"
Who should take weight loss medications?,"'Experts suggest that long-term weight loss can be safely attained by making healthy lifestyle changes, such as healthy eating patterns, limiting caloric intake, and doing regular physical activity. Individuals who have health problems related to ''obesity'' are the candidates for weight loss medications. You must consult your doctor before taking any medications for weight loss. Your doctor will examine you before prescribing the medications and may also assess whether''You must always tell your doctor about your medical history and any possible drug ''allergies'' you may have. You must also discuss it with your doctor if you already take any medicines or\xa0''supplements'' (even if they are herbal or natural). Certain medicines may not be appropriate for you if you are ''pregnant'', ''breastfeeding'', or planning to get pregnant soon.''Weight-loss medications are generally prescribed in adults who:''Or''Since lifestyle modifications, such as a healthy ''diet'' and ''exercise'', are the best approach for weight loss; every overweight or obese individual does not need these medications. Adopting a healthy lifestyle not only helps reduce weight but also takes care of other associated issues, such as ''eating disorders'' or problems with ''sleep''.' There will be any possible benefits of weight loss. The medication has any side effects. You have any health issues. You are on any other medications. You have any significant medical history in the family. The medication-cost will be acceptable for you. Have a BMI of 30 Kg/m2 or more. Have a BMI of 27 Kg/m2 or more along with the presence of weight-related health problems, such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure."
Can weight loss medications be given to teens and children?,"'Most of the weight loss medications approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are only for adults. The weight loss medication Orlistat, however, is approved to use in children ages 12 years and older.' "
What is ulcerative colitis?,"'Ulcerative colitis'' (UC) is a chronic condition that causes inflammation of the ''large intestine'' (colon) and the rectum and sores (ulcers) on the inner lining of the ''large intestine''. ''Ulcerative colitis'' is thought to be an autoimmune disease, that is, one where the body attacks itself. It is a type of ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD''). It is not the same as '""Crohn's disease""', another type of ''IBD'', which can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, whereas ''ulcerative colitis'' only affects the colon and rectum. It is also not the same as '' irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS''), which affects how the colon functions and does not cause inflammation.''Ulcerative colitis'' is estimated to affect nearly 907,000 Americans, and it affects males slightly more often than females. The disease is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 40.'  "
What are the symptoms of ulcerative colitis?,"'''Symptoms of ulcerative colitis'' include ' 
feeling an 
urgent need to take a bowel movement, 
	 fatigue, 

	 abdominal pain and cramping, 
	
	 diarrhea, 

	 loss of appetite, 
	
	 weight loss, 

	 rectal bleeding and 

	 anemia (low red 
blood cell count).
	"
What causes ulcerative colitis?,"'The cause of ''ulcerative colitis'' is unknown but it is believed to be caused by a combination of several factors including an overactive immune system, genetics, and the environment. ''Physical or e''motional stress'', and certain foods do not cause ulcerative colitis, however, they may trigger symptoms in a person who has ulcerative colitis. ' Overactive immune system: It is believed that in ulcerative colitis, the 
immune system is triggered to mistakenly attack the inner lining of the large 
intestine, causing inflammation and symptoms of ulcerative colitis.  Genetics: Ulcerative colitis 
can run in families. The genetic link is not entirely clear but studies show 
that up to 20% of people with ulcerative colitis have a close family member with the disease. 
	 Environment: Certain environmental factors including taking certain medications 
	(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs, antibiotics, and oral 
contraceptives), and eating a high fat diet may slightly increase the risk of 
developing ulcerative colitis."
What is an ulcerative colitis diet?,"'A person with ulcerative colitis may find they need to modify their ''diet'' to help manage their symptoms. There is not a single ''diet'' or meal plan that fits everyone with ulcerative colitis, and diets are individualized for each patient. Depending on symptoms different types of diets may be recommended, such as:''Attention to ''nutrition'' is important for patients with ulcerative colitis, as the symptoms of ''diarrhea'' and bleeding can lead to ''dehydration'', ''electrolyte'' imbalance, and loss of nutrients. It may be necessary to take ''nutritional supplements'' if your symptoms do not allow you to eat a nutritionally balanced diet. Talk to your health-care professional about what ''supplements'' to take. Many people with ulcerative colitis find it easiest to eat smaller, more frequent meals rather than a few large ones. This can also help increase the ''nutrition'' absorbed from the foods you eat. ' A high-calorie diet: Many people with ulcerative colitis lose weight and can 
develop signs of malnutrition. A high calorie diet may prevent these problems. 
	 A 
lactose-free diet: People with ulcerative colitis may also have lactose intolerance.  A low-fat 
diet: Ulcerative colitis may interfere with fat absorption and eating fatty 
foods may trigger symptoms. This is often recommended during an ulcerative 
	colitis flare.  A 
low-fiber diet  (low-residue 
	diet): This can help reduce the frequency of bowel movements and 
abdominal cramps.  A low-salt diet: This diet is used when patients are on 
corticosteroid therapy to help reduce water retention.  A low FODMAP diet: FODMAP 
stands for Fermentable Oligo-Di-Monosaccha-rides and Polyols, which are types of 
sugars found in certain carbohydrates and sugar alcohols. This diet is used in 
people who have intolerance to FODMAPS.  A gluten-free diet: 
	People with ulcerative colitis may 
also be sensitive to gluten. "
19 trigger foods to avoid with an ulcerative colitis diet plan,"'Dietary choices do not cause ulcerative colitis, but certain foods can trigger and worsen symptoms. Learning to identify trigger foods can help reduce the frequency and severity of ''ulcerative colitis symptoms''. Not all people with ulcerative colitis have the same triggers, but a list of some of the most common include: '   Alcohol can stimulate the intestine, triggering 
	diarrhea. Some people 
tolerate alcohol better than others.  
Caffeine, found in coffee, tea, 
	chocolate, 
and energy drinks, is a stimulant and can speed up the transit time in the 
colon, leading to more frequent trips to the bathroom.  Carbonated 
beverages including sodas and beer contain carbonation that can irritate the 
digestive tract, and cause 
	gas. Many contain 
	sugar, 
	caffeine, or artificial 
sweeteners, which can also be ulcerative colitis triggers.  Dairy products should be avoided if 
you are lactose intolerant, as they can cause symptoms similar to ulcerative 
colitis. Not everyone with ulcerative colitis is lactose intolerant.  Dried beans, peas, and 
legumes are all high in fiber and can increase bowel movements, abdominal 
cramping, and gas. If you are a 
vegetarian or vegan, you can try these foods in 
small amounts, or pureed to see if they do not trigger symptoms.  Dried fruits, 
berries, fruits with pulp or seeds are other foods high in fiber that can 
trigger ulcerative colitis symptoms.  Foods containing sulfur or sulfate can cause excess gas 
production. Sulfate may be found in many foods, including beer, wine, some 
juices, dairy milk, eggs, cheese, dates, dried apples and apricots, almonds, 
wheat pasta, breads, peanuts, cruciferous vegetables, raisins, prunes, red meat, 
and some supplements.  High fiber foods, including whole-grains, can increase 
bowel movements, abdominal cramping, and gas.  Meats, especially fatty meats, can 
trigger ulcerative colitis symptoms. Excess fat may not be properly absorbed during a flare, and 
this can make symptoms worse. Red meat can be high in sulfate, which triggers 
gas.  Nuts and crunchy nut butters, and seeds that are not ground up (such as in 
smooth peanut butter or tahini) can cause worsening abdominal cramping, bloating, and diarrhea. During a flare, even tiny fruit seeds (such as those in 
strawberries or in jams) may trigger symptoms.  Popcorn is another high fiber, 
bulky food that is not completely digested by the small intestine and can 
trigger diarrhea and bowel movement urgency.  Sugar alcohols (such as 
	sorbitol 
and mannitol) are found in sugar-free gum and candies, some ice creams, and some 
fruits and fruit juices (apples, pears, peaches, and prunes) and can cause 
diarrhea, bloating, and gas in some people.  Chocolate contains caffeine and 
sugar, both of which can irritate the digestive tract and cause cramping and 
more frequent bowel movements.  Vegetables, especially raw vegetables, are high 
in fiber and can be difficult to digest, causing bloating, gas, and abdominal 
cramps. This is particularly true for stringy vegetables such as broccoli, 
celery, cabbage, onions, and Brussels sprouts. Many people with ulcerative 
	colitis also find it 
hard to digest corn and mushrooms because they are hard to digest to begin with. 
	 Refined sugar can pull more water into the gut and cause diarrhea. 
	 Spicy foods, 
hot sauces, and pepper can cause diarrhea in many people, and in someone with 
ulcerative colitis experiencing a flare spicy hot foods may trigger or worsen 
symptoms.  Gluten, found in wheat, rye, barley, and some oats, can trigger 
symptoms similar to ulcerative colitis in people who have gluten sensitivity. 
	"
What foods help manage and soothe ulcerative colitis flares?,"'Avoiding foods that trigger ulcerative colitis symptoms is one way to help manage symptoms through diet. Another is knowing what foods to eat that may help relieve flares. Following is a list of foods that may help soothe ulcerative colitis flares: '  Salmon and albacore tuna contain 

omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce inflammation during a flare and may 
help you to stay in remission. Other sources of omega-3s include mackerel, 
herring, sardines,  flaxseed oil, ground flaxseed, and walnuts. Some people may 
be unable to eat whole nuts and flaxseeds during a flare, but they may be 
tolerated if ground up.  Lean meats and poultry are recommended 
following flares of ulcerative because proteins are often lost. Increasing your 
protein intake can help replenish the nutrients lost during a flare. Eggs are another great source of 
protein, and are often well-tolerated even during flares. Some eggs are 
fortified with omega-3 fatty acids, which can help 
	reduce inflammation.  
Soy-based protein can be substituted 
for animal protein in vegetarians and vegans. Other good sources of non-animal 
proteins include legumes and whole grains.  Probiotics, usually found in yogurt, 
kefir, sauerkraut, and miso, are good bacteria that can aid in digestion. Choose 
yogurts that are low in added sugars, as sugar can aggravate ulcerative colitis 
symptoms.  Avocados are an excellent source of 
protein and 
	healthy fats. They are calorie dense, but because they are about 70% 
water, they are easily digested.  Unsweetened applesauce is bland and may 
be tolerated after an ulcerative colitis flare, though some people may find it 
difficult to tolerate during a flare-up.  Instant oatmeal contains refined grains 
and is often easier than steel cut or old-fashioned oatmeal because it has a 
little less fiber.  Squash is a healthy choice that is 
usually well-tolerated during an ulcerative colitis flare. It's full of fiber, 
vitamin C, and beta carotene. Any variety of squash (butternut, zucchini, 
spaghetti, acorn, winter, and summer) are best tolerated cooked. Raw squash may 
aggravate ulcerative colitis symptoms during a flare.  Juice and smoothies can be tolerated by 
some during a flare, and can help you maintain good nutrition. Carrot juice is 
chock full of vitamin A and antioxidants and many 
	people with ulcerative colitis find it easy to 
tolerate.  Plantains, which are a variety of 
banana, can help aid digestion."
"How can I track foods that cause flare-ups and trigger symptoms of my 
ulcerative colitis?","""The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America recommends people with ulcerative colitis to keep a food journal to keep track of what they eat. Note what you eat and drink, and how you feel afterwards, noting any symptoms that arise. Start to keep a list of any foods you suspect may trigger or aggravate your ulcerative ""'colitis symptoms''. A food diary will also help you figure out if you are getting adequate ''nutrition'', and can help your doctor or dietician determine the right diet for you to manage your symptoms and prevent flares. '""The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America also has an interactive food tracking tool. It is available online or as a mobile app.""'www.ccfa.org/gibuddy' "
What other things trigger ulcerative colitis symptoms and flare-ups?,"'In addition to foods that trigger ulcerative colitis flare-ups, there are certain environmental risk factors that may also trigger flares. '   Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen 
	[Advil, Motrin, Nuprin], 
naproxen 
	[Naproxen]) may cause colitis or worsen the condition. NSAIDs increase the 
occurrence of bloody diarrhea, weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, and 
abdominal pain.  Where you live may predispose you to a higher incidence of 
ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis is found more commonly in developed countries, urban 
areas, and northern climates. The highest rates for ulcerative colitis are reported in the 
United States, Denmark, and Iceland.  Stress does not cause ulcerative colitis 
but it can make symptoms worse. Stress management techniques can be important in 
managing your ulcerative colitis symptoms.  Not taking medications or improper dosing of 
medications that are used to treat ulcerative colitis can bring on a flare. 
Medications for ulcerative colitis must be taken regularly, even when you feel well. Take 
medications as prescribed. Do not skip doses, cut doses, or increase doses. 
 Antibiotics may cause diarrhea in some people. If you have an infection, tell 
your doctor to figure out the right antibiotic for you. You may also take a 
probiotic along with the antibiotic to help prevent diarrhea. "
"Which specialties of health-care professionals prescribe an ulcerative 
colitis diet?","'A ''gastroenterologist'' is a specialist in disorders of the digestive tract and can prescribe a diet for ulcerative colitis. In addition, dietitians and nutritionists who are familiar with the disorder may also help create a diet and meal plan to manage ulcerative colitis. ' "
What are the symptoms of dementia and Alzheimer’s?,"'The symptoms of dementia vary depending on its cause. The common symptoms are:''Alzheimer’s disease progresses through different stages. Thus, the signs and symptoms may vary according to the stage of the disease. The typical signs of Alzheimer’s are:' Decline in memory Problems in communication and speech Alterations in thinking ability Changes in thinking skills Problems with judgment and reasoning Decrease in focus and concentration Abnormal visual perceptions such as seeing things which are not there (hallucinations), inability to detect movement or see the difference between colors The person has a progressive decline in memory They report the inability to focus and concentrate The person repeatedly asks the same questions They forget something they just read They have trouble staying organized They find it difficult to make and execute plans They tend to forget names A lack of interest in the surroundings: the person avoids conversations or participating in activities Inability to remember personal details such as phone number and home address They may confuse people and relations, for instance, they may confuse their wife with their mother.  They forget names but may recognize faces.  They may also exhibit loss of bowel and bladder control.  The person needs help for basic needs such as eating, drinking, sitting up and walking. They may even forget how to smile or swallow their food properly.  They often develop stiffness and joint deformities."
Is being diagnosed with dementia means the person has Alzheimer’s?,"'No. Being diagnosed with dementia does not necessarily mean the person has Alzheimer’s. It simply means being diagnosed with a set of symptoms such as a decline in memory, thinking, and reasoning. Dementia may be due to various causes such as ''stroke'' and substance abuse, and not just Alzheimer’s. For the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, your doctor needs to do specialized investigations such as a positron emission tomography (PET) scan besides physical examination and other tests.' "
Is there a cure for dementia and Alzheimer’s?,"'There is no cure for Alzheimer’s. The progression of the diseases can be stopped or slowed by various drug and non-drug options. Medical help must be sought as soon as the symptoms appear.''Dementia, however, may be cured in certain cases such as dementia due to certain medications and vitamin deficiencies.' "
What is an electrocardiogram?,"'An ''electrocardiogram'' or electrocardiograph (''ECG'' or ''EKG'') is the same thing. An EKG is a test that examines the ''heart function'' by measuring the electrical activity of the ''heart''. With each heartbeat, an electrical impulse (or wave) travels through the heart. This wave causes the muscle to squeeze and pump blood from the heart. An electrocardiogram measures and records the electrical activity that passes through the heart. Based on the electrocardiogram, the doctor determines whether the electrical activity of the heart is normal or irregular.''The discrepancy between the two terms and abbreviations comes in part from German. Electrocardiogram\xa0\xa0(ECG) an English word, whereas elektrokardiogramm (EKG) is a German word.' "
What does an ECG test for?,"'An ECG is done to:' Detect abnormal heart rhythms that may have caused blood clots. Detect heart problems, including a recent or ongoing heart attack, abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), coronary artery blockage, areas of the damaged heart muscle (from a prior heart attack), enlargement of the heart and inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart (pericarditis). a recent or ongoing heart attack,  abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias),  coronary artery blockage,  areas of the damaged heart muscle (from a prior heart attack),  enlargement of the heart and  inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart (pericarditis). Detect non-heart conditions such as electrolyte imbalances, thyroid imbalances and lung diseases. electrolyte imbalances,  thyroid imbalances and  lung diseases. Monitor recovery from a heart attack, progression of heart disease or the effectiveness of certain heart medications or a pacemaker. Rule out hidden heart disease in patients about to undergo surgery."
What happens during an electrocardiogram?," Electrocardiogram is a painless procedure.  Usually, a medical technician places 12 electrodes with adhesive pads on the skin of chest, arms and legs.  During the test, patient may lie flat while a computer creates a picture digitally or on graph paper of the electrical impulses that move through the heart.  It takes about 10 minutes to place the electrodes and complete the test, but the actual recording takes only a few seconds."
What are the different types of an electrocardiogram?,"'Besides the standard EKG, your doctor may recommend other EKGs that include:\xa0' Holter monitor: It's a portable EKG that checks the electrical activity of the heart for one to two days, 24 hours a day. The doctor may suggest it if a patient may have an abnormal heart rhythm, palpitations or doesn't have enough blood flow to the heart muscle. Event monitor: The doctor may suggest this device if the patient has intermittent symptoms. When the patient pushes a button, it will record and store the heart's electrical activity for a few minutes. Patient may need to wear it for weeks or sometimes months to confirm a diagnosis. Signal-averaged electrocardiogram: It checks if the patient is at high risk of getting a condition called heart arrhythmia, which can lead to cardiac arrest. The test is done in a similar way as a standard EKG, but it uses sophisticated formulas to analyze the risk."
What are the side effects of an electrocardiogram?,"'Electrocardiogram is a\xa0harmless procedure, but a few rare patients may have a slight skin reaction to the electrodes, which subsides on its own.' "
What Is the difference between hemodialysis and dialysis?,"'Dialysis'' is a procedure that helps your blood get filtered by a machine that works like an artificial kidney.''Based on the difference in techniques, there are two types of dialysis' Hemodialysis: Your entire blood is circulated outside your body in a machine placed outside the body known as a dialyzer. This dialyzer acts like an artificial kidney that cleans and returns the blood to your body. This is done either at a dialysis facility or at home. The term dialysis generally refers to hemodialysis and there is no difference between these two terminologies. Peritoneal dialysis: Unlike hemodialysis that cleans the blood outside your body, peritoneal dialysis helps filter the blood in the body itself. This is done by allowing cleansing fluid to flow into the abdomen via a tube. The lining of the abdomen extracts the waste from the blood, and then, the fluid along with the wastes is drained out of the body."
Who needs hemodialysis?,"'A person whose kidney function has declined considerably needs hemodialysis. This happens when only 10% to 15% of the kidney function is left. This condition is known as ''kidney failure'' or ''end-stage renal disease'' (''ESRD'').''The common causes of ''kidney failure'' include''Kidney failure is diagnosed when certain tests, such as the kidney function tests, show abnormal levels. When your kidneys fail, the signs and symptoms that usually develop include' Diabetes High blood pressure Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and IgA nephropathy Polycystic kidney disease (a genetic condition in which multiple cysts develop in the kidney) Nephrotic syndrome Nausea and vomiting Muscle cramps Itching Loss of appetite Swelling in your feet and ankles Polyuria (too much urine) or oliguria (decreased urine output) Difficulty breathing Trouble sleeping"
What happens during hemodialysis?,"'During hemodialysis, your blood is pumped to a machine known as ‘dialyzer’ that is placed outside the body. The pumping of blood takes place via a tube where one end is connected to the dialyzer and the other end goes into your arms or neck. The access into the body can be created in either of the following three ways\xa0''The ''dialysis machine'' pumps the waste-filled blood through the filter and returns the clean (filtered) blood to your body. During the process, the dialysis machine checks your ''blood pressure'' and controls the speed of blood flow from your body and back into your body.' Fistula: This is a connection made between an artery and a vein in your arm. Graft: A soft tube joins an artery and a vein in your arm. Catheter: A soft tube is placed into a large vein of your neck."
How long does each hemodialysis treatment take?,"'In a dialysis center, a single session of hemodialysis usually takes around 4 hours.''Hemodialysis is generally done three times per week on alternate days.''You can also do the dialysis procedure at home after getting adequate training from the nurse. While at home, dialysis treatment can be carried out as many as four to seven times a week for a shorter duration each time.' "
What lifestyle changes are required during hemodialysis?,"'Hemodialysis may affect your routine life significantly because it takes a lot of your time. You need to make certain adjustments in your life when you have planned to go ahead with it. Here are a few of the changes that your doctor will generally advise you.''Have a discussion with your dialysis center’s dietician about which ''diet'' plan will work best for you. The right hemodialysis plan along with an appropriate diet can make your dialysis sessions much better.' Make changes to your dietLimit foods and liquids that are rich in sodium, potassium and phosphorus.Restrict liquid intake, including water intake, to 32 ounces in a day.Eat a high-protein diet, especially one that has high-quality proteins, such as eggs, fish, meat and poultry.Only take kidney-friendly vitamins.

What are the side effects of marijuana?,'Medical marijuana use is generally considered safe. It is the high content of THC present in certain strains of marijuana that can cause symptoms such as:' Headache Dry mouth Dry eyes Nausea Frequent coughing Increased hunger Fatigue Dizziness Drowsiness Paranoid thinking A disconnected state (dissociation)
What precautions to take while consuming marijuana?,"'If the use of marijuana is legal in your region, you still need to remember certain things before consuming it. These are:''You can ask your healthcare provider who can take down your medical history and recommend which strain will work best for you. Another way is to cautiously use a trial-and-error approach through which you can figure out the marijuana strain that works well for your needs.' Use marijuana with caution if you have any mental illness. Marijuana use can cause problems in mental or cognitive functions and should be used with caution if you have a mental health condition. Don't drive or operate machinery if you are on marijuana. Drowsiness due to marijuana can lead to accidents. Avoid marijuana if you have high blood pressure or respiratory issues. Smoking marijuana can be bad for your heart because it increases your blood pressure. Long-term marijuana use can worsen respiratory conditions. Stay away from marijuana 2 weeks before planned surgery. Marijuana can enhance the effects of the anesthetic drug used during surgery and cause problems due to anesthesia."
What are the different types of hysterectomy?,"'Hysterectomy'' is the surgical removal of the uterus. It is the second most commonly performed surgery in non-''pregnant'' women.''A total hysterectomy involves the removal of the whole uterus and cervix, whereas a radical hysterectomy is the removal of the whole uterus and its adjacent tissues (ligaments), cervix and some part of the vagina. The surgeon may also remove the surrounding ''lymph nodes''.' "
Who needs a radical hysterectomy?,"'A radical hysterectomy is performed only in selected patients with''The doctors mostly consider young women or older women with no other coexisting illness fit for the surgery. ''Obese'' women are generally avoided.''With the use of ''radiation therapy'' for ''cancer'' and conservative treatments (minor procedures), a radical hysterectomy is performed less commonly than it was performed in earlier times. Women can now opt for ''radiation'' instead of going for a radical hysterectomy. Women who do not want to attend long sessions of radiation therapy usually opt for a radical hysterectomy. Still, more than 50% of women will require a few sessions of radiotherapy even after surgery.''There are times when even radiation therapy fails to resolve ''cervical cancer'' completely or results in the recurrence of ''cancer''. Radical hysterectomy becomes a potential rescue operation in such cases.\xa0' Cervical cancer (initial stage) Stage II endometrial cancer (cancer of the uterus with the involvement of the cervix)"
How is a radical hysterectomy performed?,"'A radical hysterectomy may be performed by several types of surgical approaches: vaginally, abdominally or laparoscopically (either traditional or robotic-assisted).''Abdominal hysterectomy: ''The doctor makes a large cut of about 6 to 12 inches in the lower abdomen.''Vaginal hysterectomy:'' The operation is performed by making a cut (incision) into the vagina.''Laparoscopic hysterectomy:'' This is the traditional method of a laparoscopic surgery. A long and thin tube-like camera (laparoscope) is inserted through one of several small ''cuts'' in the lower abdomen. This tube helps visualize the uterus. The uterus is then removed through either one of the incisions or the vagina.''Robotic (robotically assisted) hysterectomy:'' This type of hysterectomy surgery involves making small cuts in the lower abdomen and using a laparoscope. However, additionally, a robotic arm will be there to help the surgeon perform the surgery.' "
How long does it take to recover from a radical hysterectomy?,"'The length of the hospital stay after a radical hysterectomy depends on the surgical approach used and the patient’s age and general health condition.''If a vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy has been performed, the woman may be discharged one to four days after surgery.''If the woman had an abdominal hysterectomy, she will need to stay for four to five days in the hospital.''Follow-up may be scheduled generally within four to six weeks after the surgery. However, in most cases, it is not necessary unless there are any complications.''It generally takes about four to six weeks to recover from a radical abdominal hysterectomy, whereas healing time is faster in the case of a vaginal or laparoscopic one.''Women may begin having sexual intercourse within four to six weeks, depending upon how soon the vagina heals.''Walking'' can be resumed soon after, but lifting weights should be avoided for at least six weeks after surgery.' "
What are the complications of a radical hysterectomy?,"'Every major surgery comes with certain risks. A radical hysterectomy is no exception. The possible complications include' Damage to the surrounding organs (such as the bladder, ureter, bowel and blood vessels) Surgical wound infection Abscess at the surgical wound Bleeding from the wound Bowel obstruction Pulmonary embolus (dislodgement of a blood clot in the artery supplying blood to the lungs resulting in sudden shortness of breath) Heart attack Pneumonia"
What do dermabrasion and microdermabrasion mean?,"'Dermabrasion'' is a skin-resurfacing procedure. In this procedure, your dermatologist (skin doctor) or ''plastic surgeon'' sands your skin with a special rotating instrument and removes the outer layer of your skin. The skin that grows back is usually smoother. It makes your skin look newer, younger and smoother. It may reduce the appearance of fine lines, sun damage, ''acne'' ''scars'', surgical scars, ''age spots'', ''wrinkles'' and uneven texture.\xa0''Microdermabrasion'' is a minimally invasive procedure performed by non-medical professionals. In this procedure, tiny exfoliating crystals are sprayed on to your skin with a special applicator with an abrasive surface to gently sand away the thick outer layer of your skin and renew and rejuvenate the overall skin tone and texture. It may improve the appearance of your dull skin by lightening brown spots, sun damage, ''wrinkles'', fine lines, age spots, ''acne'' scars, ''melasma'' and other skin-related concerns.' "
What is the difference between dermabrasion and microdermabrasion?,"'Microdermabrasion should not be confused with dermabrasion. They are different procedures due to the following details' Procedure: Dermabrasion is a more invasive technique that is performed by skin specialists or plastic surgeons under local or general anesthesia. However, microdermabrasion is a non-surgical, non-invasive, painless technique that is usually performed by non-medical professionals who do not need any specific expertise.  Instruments: A special rotating instrument is used in dermabrasion. Microdermabrasion is performed with a combination of fine abrasive tips, crystals and vacuum suction that is applied to your skin. Mechanism: Dermabrasion produces controlled skin damage involving the deeper layers of the skin. The subsequent wound heals with a scar that is cosmetically better. Dermabrasion may cause substantial changes in the appearance of your skin by injuring it in a controlled way using an abrasive. However, the microdermabrasion technique affects only the outermost dull layer of your skin that is composed of dead horny cells that shed off and produce transient changes. Scope of treatment: Dermabrasion mostly treats deeper scars such as acne scars, pockmarks, age spots and scars from accidents or disease. However, with microdermabrasion, facial skin and skin elsewhere on the body can be treated. Microdermabrasion is good for all skin types and colors, whereas dermabrasion is only prescribed for people with lighter or fairer skin tones. Anesthesia: During dermabrasion, your doctor numbs your skin with local anesthesia and, occasionally, you may receive intravenous sedation or general anesthesia, depending on the extent of your treatment. However, no needles or anesthetics are required for microdermabrasion. During the procedure: During dermabrasion, an abrasive high-speed rotating device, such as a wire brush or diamond-encrusted wheel or even abrasive screening, is applied to your skin depending on the location and area of treatment. In microdermabrasion, tiny crystals are sprayed or rubbed with sufficient force to dislodge superficial skin cells without damaging the deeper layers of your skin. Postoperative care: Dermabrasion is a more aggressive procedure than microdermabrasion and it removes more wrinkles and scars efficiently. Unlike microdermabrasion, dermabrasion may cause bleeding. The wound produced by dermabrasion is like any other wound and must be kept clean and moist. A postoperative dressing may be required after the procedure. Because microdermabrasion does not produce a wound, there are no postoperative issues apart from temporary mild redness and swelling. Recovery: After dermabrasion, your doctor will instruct you to apply petroleum jelly on the wound surface frequently. The skin will be sensitive and discolored for some weeks and may require about three months to return to normal. However, microdermabrasion resolves without any downtime. Healing usually occurs within 10 days and redness may subside after two to six weeks. Insurance: Insurance coverage is not available for either of these procedures because they are almost always cosmetic."

What is the difference between plastic surgery and cosmetic surgery?,"'The terms ''plastic surgery'' and ''cosmetic surgery'' are often used interchangeably. Although both disciplines of medical science aim at improving a person’s body, they are different from each other in many aspects. Even the cosmetic and ''plastic'' surgeons may have different qualifications and expertise. The differences between cosmetic and plastic surgery are as follows''1. Definition''2. Whether elective or emergency procedure''3. Why is it done (indications)''4. Whether insurance is applicable' Plastic surgery: This is the surgical specialty that deals with the reconstruction of facial and body defects due to birth disorders, injuries, burns and diseases. It is reconstructive, which means it is focused on correcting the dysfunctional areas of the body. It is also called reconstructive surgery. Cosmetic surgery: This is the branch of medicine dedicated toward the enhancement of appearance through various surgical and medical techniques. It can be performed anywhere on the body including the face, neck, chest and abdomen. The area to be treated is not dysfunctional, but may need to be aesthetically enhanced according to the patient. It is also called aesthetic surgery. Plastic surgery: This may be done as an elective or emergency surgery. Emergency means there is an urgent threat to the person’s life, organ, limb or any other part of the body. For example, plastic surgery may be done for scalp lacerations (deep scalp wounds), nasal injuries, lacerations on the face, etc. Cosmetic surgery: Cosmetic surgery is always an elective procedure because the area to be treated is not dysfunctional, but may need to be aesthetically enhanced according to the patient. Plastic surgery: This is performed to repair defects or damage on the face or body and to reconstruct the dysfunctional or nonfunctional areas. Plastic surgery may be done forRepair of the handBurn repairCleft lip or palate repairMastectomy (breast removal surgery) scar repairBreast reduction for chronic neck and back painScar revision surgery (done to minimize a scar so that it is less visible and blends well with the surrounding skin tone and texture)Reconstruction of the lower limbs (legs, thighs, feet or toes)Trauma surgery Repair of the hand Burn repair Cleft lip or palate repair Mastectomy (breast removal surgery) scar repair Breast reduction for chronic neck and back pain Scar revision surgery (done to minimize a scar so that it is less visible and blends well with the surrounding skin tone and texture) Reconstruction of the lower limbs (legs, thighs, feet or toes) Trauma surgery Cosmetic surgery: This is done to improve the appearance or aesthetic appeal of a part of the body.

Cosmetic surgery: Because cosmetic surgery deals with aesthetic enhancement in the absence of medical indications, it may not be covered by medical insurance. The patient should contact their  insurance provider for details."
What causes autism spectrum disorder?,"'What exactly causes autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains a mystery, and the research to find it is still going on. Until now, a combination of various factors including environmental, biological, and genetic factors is thought to make a child likely to be at risk of ASD.''The risk factors for ASD include:' Having multiple genes concerned with the development of ASD Having a sibling, parent, or a near relative with ASD  Having certain genetic or chromosomal disorders (such as fragile X syndrome or tuberous sclerosis) Taking prescription drugs, valproic acid, and thalidomide during pregnancy Being born to older parents"
What are the signs and symptoms of autism spectrum disorder?,"'Signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are noticed in childhood, most commonly around two to three years of age, and typically stay for a lifetime.''Children or adults with ASD have problems in understanding non-verbal clues and body language. They react in a specific way and want things to be in a certain way, causing social awkwardness.''Instances of how children or adults with ASD usually behave are given below:''The ASD spectrum can include:''Normal functioning individuals with ASD: they have average intellect. With proper therapy, they can cope with the people around them, groom themselves well, and hold on to a job.' Delayed milestones: The child does not coo, babble, smile, and look at parents as expected even by six to nine months of age. They avoid eye contact. They might point at objects. They show no interest in talking with people. They prefer to be alone. They fail to express how they feel through facial expressions or words. They repeat the same words or sentences uttered by the people around them. They keep doing the same actions over and over again. They have trouble expressing their needs through normal sentences or gestures. They resist any change in routine. They do not like cuddling by parents or other family members. High functioning individuals: They are exceptionally skilled at math, art, physics. They can groom themselves and hold on to a job. They have a higher than normal IQ.  Poor functioning individuals: They have poor intellect. They often need help with daily activities like going to the washroom, bathing, and feeding. They may also have convulsions and may need constant medicines and physiotherapy."
How is autism spectrum disorder diagnosed?,"'There are no specifics such as a blood test or imaging test (such as ''ultrasonography'', X-ray, etc.) to diagnose autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Doctors take a complete medical history, ask a few questions to the parents or guardian, and examine the child’s behavior and development to make the diagnosis.''ASD is not always a childhood diagnosis. Some people get diagnosed even when they are 18 years or older. As a result, such people fail to receive the necessary support and treatment at an early age.' "
What is the role of parents in the management of their child with ASD?,"'If parents suspect their child exhibits signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), they should schedule their appointment with a doctor who is anyone from the following:''At the same time, parents take the help of a program known as “Child Find evaluation.” This program offers a free evaluation of the child that can be requested by just calling the state’s public early childhood system.''If a child gets diagnosed with ASD, here is what the parents can do.''There is no cure for ASD. However, early diagnosis is very important. If caught before two years, behavioral therapy can make use of their still-developing brain to help them cope with social situations and understand body language better. Some kids may need medications to control tantrums, ''aggression'', ''hyperactivity'', ''anxiety'', etc.' Developmental Pediatricians (doctors who have special training in child development disorders) Child Neurologists (doctors who are specialized in treating diseases of the brain, spine, and nerves) Child Psychologists or Psychiatrists (doctors who are trained in counseling/treating mind disorders) They can collect information from various educational resources about ASD. They can connect with other parents of children with autism. They can consult the doctor for specific concerns regarding their child."
What is mechanical ventilation?,"'Mechanical ventilation is a treatment to help a person breathe when they find it difficult or are unable to breathe on their own. A mechanical ventilator pushes airflow into the patient’s ''lungs'' to help them breathe.\xa0''Mechanical ventilation may be\xa0' Invasive ventilation with a tube inserted into the patient’s airway, performed in the intensive care unit in the hospital. Noninvasive ventilation that can be used at home by people with respiratory difficulties."
Does mechanical ventilation treat COVID-19 coronavirus?,'Mechanical ventilation is part of the arsenal of supportive care clinicians use for ''COVID-19'' coronavirus disease patients with the most severe lung symptoms.''A ''COVID-19'' infection can cause fluids and ''mucus'' in the lungs that block oxygenation of lung tissue.\xa0 Mechanical ventilation can help support ''COVID-19'' patients ''breathing'' until their immune system and treatment can clear the infection and proper lung function is restored.\xa0''Public health experts fear there is a shortage of mechanical ventilation machines in the U.S. considering the coronavirus pandemic.' 
What are the different types of mechanical ventilation?,'Mechanical ventilation first came into use in 1929. The two types of mechanical ventilation are\xa0' Positive-pressure ventilation: pushes the air into the lungs. Negative-pressure ventilation: sucks the air into the lungs by making the chest expand and contract.
Negative-pressure ventilation,"'The early ventilators were negative-pressure ventilators. Negative pressure ventilation is very little in use now.' Iron lung: The first mechanical ventilator, a metal cylinder which enveloped the patient completely up to the neck.  Chest cuirass: A small shell which can be strapped to the patient’s chest to create the negative pressure. "
Positive-pressure ventilation,'Positive-pressure ventilators were developed in the early 1950s to treat ''polio'' patients with respiratory ''paralysis''. These ventilators blow the air into the patient’s lungs through a tube. They may be invasive or noninvasive.''Noninvasive mechanical ventilators come with masks and can be used at home. The three kinds are' Endotracheal intubation: the tube is inserted into the patient’s airway (trachea) through the mouth or nose. Tracheostomy: the tube is inserted through a hole made into the airway. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP): delivers constant and steady air pressure. Autotitrating (adjustable) positive airway pressure (APAP): changes air pressure according to the breathing pattern. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP): delivers air with different pressures for inhalation and exhalation.
How does a mechanical ventilator work?,"'The iron lung of the past forces the chest ''cavity'' to expand and contract by adjusting the air pressure inside a chamber that envelops the body up to the neck, . A vacuum pump creates a negative pressure in the iron lung’s chamber which makes the patient’s chest expand, drawing air in. When the negative pressure releases, the patient’s chest recoils, and air pushes out.\xa0''The negative pressure created in the chamber affected the stomach and ''heart'' as well, which was a problem with the iron lung. The iron lung ventilator also curtailed the patient’s mobility and made ''caregiving'' difficult.''Cuirass, developed later, is a small form-fitted shell with a bladder, strapped to a patient’s chest. Cuirass applies negative pressure to stimulate the chest to expand and contract. Cuirass is used in very few situations today. It is a suitable option for patients with neuromuscular disorders, but it cannot be used for patients lying down.''Currently positive pressure ventilation is the common form of mechanical ventilation in hospitals. The positive-pressure ventilators push the air into the patient’s airway. The ventilator continually blows and stops in regular preset cycles enabling the lungs to receive oxygen and expel carbon dioxide. Positive-pressure ventilators may be' Volume-controlled: delivers a preset volume of air into the patient’s trachea even if it entails high airway pressure. When the flow is stopped the chest recoils and expels the air out. Pressure-controlled: delivers air till the airway pressure limit is reached and the valve opens to expel air. The volume of air delivered may vary depending on the airway resistance and lung capacity. Dual control: these combine the advantages of volume control and pressure control and deliver airflow based on the requirement and response of the patient."
Why is a mechanical ventilator used?,'The mechanical ventilator does the work of a patient’s breathing so their body can rest and recover. Mechanical ventilators are used:\xa0''In the last two decades several new modes of mechanical ventilation have emerged with the merging of ventilator and computer technologies.

Is C. diff (Clostridium difficile) contagious?,"'Yes, ''C. diff'' is ''contagious''. Microorganisms can be spread from person-to-person by touch or by direct contact with contaminated objects and surfaces (for example, clothing, cell phones, door handles). Some individuals are carriers of this bacterium but have no symptoms of infection. However, these people are still infected with the bacteria can spread the infection to others.''In general, the bacteria have to increase in numbers rapidly to cause disease, so the bacteria can be transferred to people, but not cause significant infection immediately. Disease occurs when conditions favor growth of these organisms. Conditions that favor growth are''Avoiding direct and indirect physical contact with contaminated areas reduces the likelihood of contagion.' weakened immune systems, the elderly, and especially individuals that are hospitalized, and are being treated with antibiotics that suppress the normal bowel flora."
How do I know if I have an infection caused by C. diff?,"'Although the incubation period for ''Clostridium difficile'' is not precisely known, researchers suggest that the incubation period is about seven days if the conditions are favorable for bacterial proliferation. However, a person may acquire ''C. diff'' and develop no infection symptoms, but be colonized for extended time periods (years) until conditions develop that favor ''C. diff'' proliferation.''Symptoms of ''C. diff'' infection can be mild such as watery ''diarrhea'' three or more times a day with mild ''abdominal pain'' or tenderness or maybe more severe with diarrheal episodes reaching 15 times a day with severe ''abdominal pain'', blood or pus in the ''stool'', ''fever'', ''weight loss'' and ''loss of appetite''.''In most instances, the confirmatory diagnosis is made by detecting a cytotoxin produced by ''C. diff'"" in the patient's ""'stool'' sample.'  "
How does C. diff spread?,"'As described above, ''Clostridium difficile'' can be spread from person-to-person by direct contact and indirect contact with contaminated objects (clothing, eating utensils, and tabletops, for examples). ''C. diff'' spreads easily in hospitals because often the highest concentrations of these bacteria are in hospitalized patients treated with antibiotics. Strict hand washing techniques and patient isolation methods can reduce ''C. diff'' spread in hospitals and other areas.' "
How will I know if I am no longer contagious for C. diff?,"'People infected with ''C. diff'' who become ill usually are treated with special antibiotics (''metronidazole'' (''Flagyl''), ''vancomycin'' (''Vancocin''), ''rifaximin'' (''Xifaxan'') and/or fidaxomicin) for about 10 to 14 days. Severe infections may require intravenous antibiotics and even surgery.''A person with ''C. diff'' becomes less contagious as the symptoms decrease, and little or no toxin is detected in their stools. However, since the person previously infected is still capable of relapsing and/or becoming a carrier for ''Clostridium difficile,'' it is difficult to say if the they are no longer contagious. However, the person is less likely to transfer ''C. difficile'' to others when their symptoms resolve after treatment.'  "
When should I seek medical care for C. diff?," If you or someone you know develops mild to moderate watery diarrhea, cramping abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue and fever, especially after taking antibiotics, seek medical care. If you or someone you know is dehydrated, has a fever, decreased bowel sounds and/or abdominal rigidity, and possible perforation of the colon with a very tender abdomen, you or they should seek immediate emergency medical care. Hospitalized patients on antibiotics are monitored for signs and symptoms of C. diff infection including diarrhea and abdominal pain."
Facts you should know about C. diff (C. difficile colitis)," Clostridium difficile colitis (C. difficile Colitis, C. diff) is an infection of the colon by the bacterium, Clostridium difficile  (C. difficile ). C. difficile causes colitis by producing toxins that damage the lining of the colon. The symptoms of C. difficile colitis are fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Serious complications of C. difficile colitis include dehydration, rupture of the colon, and spread of infection to the abdominal cavity or body. Severe infection is life-threatening. The most common cause of 
C. difficile colitis is treated with antibiotics. The antibiotics are believed to suppress normal colonic bacteria that usually keep C. difficile from multiplying and causing colitis. Most cases of C. difficile colitis occur in patients in the hospital, but the number of cases that occur among individuals not having been in or recently discharged from the hospital has increased greatly. The primary means of diagnosing 
C. difficile colitis is by testing for the bacterial toxins in samples of stool. The treatment of C. difficile colitis is with antibiotics, primarily vancomycin and metronidazole. Up to 10% of patients do not respond to a course of one of the antibiotics and require retreatment, more prolonged treatment, or treatment with a different antibiotic. Ten to 20 percent of patients who are successfully treated by their first course of antibiotics have a relapse of the colitis after the antibiotics are stopped. Among patients who relapse, additional treatment with antibiotics is less successful than the initial treatment in permanently curing the colitis, and multiple relapses in these patients are common. Among the treatments for multiple relapses of C. difficile colitis, a widely studied and effective treatment is the transplantation of fecal bacteria from relatives or stool banks."
What is Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)?,"'Clostridium difficile'' (''C. difficile'') is a bacterium that is related to the bacteria that cause ''tetanus'' and ''botulism''. The ''C. difficile'' bacterium has two forms, an active, infectious form that cannot survive in the environment for prolonged periods, and an inactive, ""noninfectious"" form, called a spore, that can survive in the environment for prolonged periods. Although spores cannot cause infection directly, when they are ingested they transform into the active, infectious form.''C. difficile'' spores are found frequently in:''They can be found on:''They even can be carried by pets. Thus, these environments are a ready source for infection with ''C. difficile.'   hospitals, nursing homes, extended care facilities, and nurseries for newborn infants. bedpans, furniture, toilet seats, linens, telephones, stethoscopes, fingernails, rings (jewelry), floors, infants' rooms, and diaper pails."
What causes Clostridium difficile colitis?,"'Antibiotic-associated (''C. difficile, C. diff'') colitis is an infection of the colon caused by ''C. difficile'' that occurs primarily among individuals who have been using\xa0'' antibiotics''. ''C. difficile ''infections are commonly acquired during hospital stays, infecting approximately 1% of patients admitted to hospitals in the United States. ''C. difficile\xa0''may also be acquired in the community, however.''It is the most common infection acquired by patients while they are in the hospital. More than half a million ''C. difficile'' infections occur in hospitals in the US each year, with about 300,000 occurring while in the hospital or shortly after hospitalization. After a stay of only 2 days in a hospital, 10% of patients will develop an infection with ''C. difficile''. ''C. difficile'' also may be acquired outside of hospitals in the community. It is estimated that about 200,000 infections with ''C. difficile'' occur in the community unrelated to hospitalization each year in the U.S.' "
How does C. diff cause colitis?,"'C. difficile'' spores lie dormant inside the colon until a person takes an antibiotic. The antibiotic disrupts the other bacteria that normally are living in the colon and preventing ''C. difficile'' from transforming into its active, disease-causing bacterial form. As a result,'' C. difficile'' transforms into its infectious form and then produces toxins (chemicals) that inflame and damage the colon. The inflammation results in an influx of white blood cells to the colon. The severity of the colitis can vary. In the more severe cases, the toxins kill the tissue of the inner lining of the colon, and the tissue falls off. The tissue that falls off is mixed with white blood cells (pus) and gives the appearance of a white, membranous patch covering the inner lining of the colon. This severe form of ''C. difficile'' colitis is called pseudomembranous colitis because the patches appear like membranes, but they are not true membranes.''Not everybody infected with ''C. difficile'' develops colitis. Many infants and young children, and even some adults, are carriers (they are infected but have no symptoms) of ''C. difficile. C. difficile'' does not cause colitis in these people probably because;' the bacteria stay in the colon as non-active spores, and the individuals have developed antibodies that protect them against the C. difficile toxins."
What are the signs and symptoms of Clostridium difficile colitis?,"'Patients with ''mild ''C. difficile'' colitis'' may have:''Patients with ''severe ''C. difficile'' colitis'' may have:''Severe diarrhea also can lead to ''dehydration'' and disturbances in the ''electrolytes'' (''minerals'') in the body. Rarely, severe colitis can lead to life-threatening complications such as toxic megacolon (markedly dilated colon), ''peritonitis'' (inflammation of the lining of the abdominal), and perforation of the colon.'   a low-grade fever, mild diarrhea (5-10 watery stools a day), mild abdominal cramps and tenderness. a high fever of 102 F to 104 F (39 C to 40 C), severe diarrhea (more than 10 watery stools a day) with blood, and severe abdominal pain and tenderness."
Which antibiotics cause Clostridium difficile colitis?,"'Although the antibiotic ''clindamycin'' (''Cleocin'') has been widely recognized as causing ''C. difficile'' colitis, many commonly prescribed antibiotics also cause colitis. Examples of antibiotics that ''frequently cause ''C. difficile'' colitis'' include:''Antibiotics that ''occasionally cause ''C. difficile'' colitis'' include:''Antibiotics that ''rarely if ever cause ''C. difficile'' colitis'' include:''In fact, metronidazole and vancomycin are two antibiotics that are used for treating ''C. difficile'' colitis; however, there are rare reports of ''C. difficile'' colitis occurring several days after stopping metronidazole.''While most ''C. difficile'' colitis in the US is caused by antibiotics, ''C. difficile'' colitis also can occur in patients without exposure to antibiotics. For example, patients with ''ulcerative colitis'"" and Crohn's disease have been known to develop ""'C. difficile'' colitis without exposure to antibiotics.''Since many antibiotics can cause ''C. difficile'' infection, all antibiotics should be used prudently. Self-administration or using antibiotics without an accurate diagnosis or a proper reason should be discouraged. On the other hand, benefits of properly prescribed antibiotics for the right reasons usually far outweigh the risk of developing ''C. difficile'' colitis.''Antibiotics can sometimes cause diarrhea that is not due to ''C. difficile'' infection. The reason for the diarrhea is not clear. The practical implication is that not all diarrhea associated with antibiotics should be considered to be due to ''C. difficile'' and treated as such.'   ampicillin,   amoxicillin, and   cephalosporins (such as 
cephalexin [Keflex]).  penicillin,   erythromycin,   trimethoprim (Primsol), and  quinolones such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro).  tetracycline,   metronidazole (Flagyl),   vancomycin (Vancocin), and   aminoglycosides (such as gentamicin [Garamycin])."
How do medical professionals diagnose C. diff colitis?,"'A history of antibiotic use is important in the diagnosis of ''C. difficile'' colitis. Patients taking antibiotics (or recently having taken antibiotics) who develop ''abdominal pain'', cramps and diarrhea are usually tested for ''C. difficile'' infection. However, doctors do not always wait for the appearance of diarrhea to start testing for ''C. difficile'' since in rare instances ''C. difficile'' can cause abdominal ''pain'' and tenderness without diarrhea.''Patients with ''C. difficile'' colitis often have elevated white blood cell counts in the blood, and, in severe colitis, the white blood cell counts can be very high (20,000 to 40,000). Patients with ''C. difficile'' colitis also often have white blood cells in their stool when a sample of stool is examined under a microscope. Elevated white blood cell counts and white blood cells in the stool, however, only demonstrate that there is colitis and not that the cause of the colitis is ''C. difficile.'' More specific tests are necessary to determine whether ''C. difficile'' is the cause of the colitis.''The most widely used test for diagnosing ''C. difficile'' colitis is a test that detects toxins produced by ''C. difficile'' in a sample of stool. There are two different toxins, toxin A and toxin B, both capable of causing colitis. Accurate tests for both toxins are available commercially for use in all laboratories. Unfortunately, like most tests in medicine, these tests for toxins are not perfect; both false positive tests (finding toxins when there is no ''C. difficile'') and false negative tests (not finding toxins when ''C. difficile'' is present) can occur. Therefore, other tests such as ''flexible sigmoidoscopy'' and ''colonoscopy'' often are necessary to look for pseudomembranes that are characteristic of ''C. difficile'' colitis.''Flexible ''sigmoidoscopy'' is an examination in which a doctor inserts a flexible fiberoptic tube with a light and a camera on its end into the rectum and sigmoid colon. (The sigmoid colon is the segment of the colon that is closest to the rectum.) In most patients with ''C. difficile'' colitis, the doctor will find pseudomembranes in the rectum and the sigmoid colon. However, some patients with ''C. difficile'' colitis will have pseudomembranes only in the right colon (the segment of the colon farthest from the rectum). Patients with pseudomembranes confined to the right colon require colonoscopy in order to see the pseudomembranes. (A ''colonoscope'' is a longer version of the flexible sigmoidoscope that is long enough to reach the right colon.)''X-ray examinations and ''computerized tomography'' (CT) examinations of the abdomen will occasionally demonstrate thickening of the wall of the colon due to inflammation, but these X-ray findings also are non-specific and only demonstrate that colitis is present. They do not demonstrate the cause of the colitis, for example, ''C. difficile.'  "
What is the treatment for Clostridium difficile colitis?,"'Treatment of ''C. difficile'' colitis includes:''In patients with mild colitis, stopping the antibiotic that caused the infection may be enough to cause the colitis and diarrhea to subside. In most cases, however, antibiotics are needed to eradicate the ''C. difficile'' bacteria.''Antibiotics that are effective against ''C. difficile'' include metronidazole (Flagyl) and vancomycin (Vancocin). People usually take these two antibiotics orally for 10 days. Both antibiotics are equally effective,  but metronidazole is less expensive.  Vancomycin is recommended in severe infections, primarily where it may be slightly more effective than metronidazole and, therefore, may be worth the additional expense. With either antibiotic, fever usually will resolve in 1-2 days, and diarrhea in 3-4 days. Several other antibiotics, some new and some older, have been used effectively against ''C. difficile'' recently, most notably fidaxomicin (Dificid).  Fidaxomicin may be slightly more effective than vancomycin, but its cost is high.  It has the advantage of being associated with fewer recurrences.'""The choice of which antibiotic to use depends on the individual patient's situation and the preferences of the treating doctor. Some doctors will prescribe metronidazole first because it is much less expensive than vancomycin. Vancomycin may be reserved for patients who do not respond to metronidazole, are ""'allergic'' to metronidazole, or develop side effects from metronidazole. Fidaxomicin, while most expensive, is associated with fewer relapses. Other doctors will prescribe vancomycin first for severe colitis because vancomycin can achieve much higher antibiotic levels in the colon than metronidazole (and higher antibiotic levels theoretically would be more effective in killing bacteria).'   correction of dehydration and electrolyte (mineral) deficiencies, discontinuing the antibiotic that caused the colitis, and using antibiotics to eradicate the C. difficile bacterium."
Why are there relapses of Clostridium difficile colitis?,"'Approximately 10% to 20% of successfully treated patients can experience a relapse of ''C. difficile'' colitis with recurrence of diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and abdominal ''pain''. Relapses typically occur days or even weeks after treatment is stopped. Some patients may experience several relapses.''The most likely explanation for relapse is that the ''C. difficile'' has not been completely eradicated by the initial course of antibiotics. ''C. difficile'' in its active bacterial form is killed by either metronidazole or vancomycin, but the spores are resistant to killing. Several days after stopping antibiotics, the surviving spores transform into active bacterial forms which will multiply and produce toxins again.'""Another reason for relapse is the body's inadequate production of antibodies against bacterial toxins. Antibodies are proteins that the body produces to fight bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections, as well as to protect the body from the harmful effects of toxins. Therefore, adults who are capable of producing adequate antibodies against ""'C. difficile'' toxins usually do not develop ''C. difficile'' colitis. Some adults who cannot produce these antibodies are susceptible to relapses.' "
What are treatment options for relapses of Clostridium difficile colitis?,"'Treatment options for relapses of ''C. difficile'' colitis include:''Doctors usually treat patients who relapse with another 10-14-day course of metronidazole or vancomycin, and a majority of the patients so treated will recover. Nevertheless, some patients will have another relapse. Treatment options for multiple relapses include:' A second course of the same or a different antibiotic, primarily vancomycin or fidaxomicin Six weeks of treatment with decreasing doses of antibiotics An oral resin by mouth such as cholestyramine (Questran) that binds toxins and inactivates them Non-pathogen (harmless) yeast by mouth such as Saccharomyces boulardii, for example, Florastor Treatment with one of the options listed above that has not already been tried. Vancomycin for 6 weeks in decreasing doses (125 mg four times a day for 1 
week, three times a day for another week, twice a day for another week and so 
on), followed by 4 weeks of cholestyramine (Questran). Two weeks of 
vancomycin or metronidazole along with 4 weeks of S. boulardii (Florastor). Fecal microbiota (bacterial population) transplants are becoming more common for relapsing patients because of the great success rates. Feces from non-infected donors are made into a suspension. The source of the transplanted fecal microbiota can be healthy family members, acquaintances or from stool banks. The fecal microbiota may be given by enema or by colonoscopy inserted into the rectum, by a feeding tube inserted through the mouth or nose into the upper small intestine, or by way of frozen capsules taken by mouth. The normal bacteria from the donor's stool displaces the C. difficile bacteria. Passive immunizations with human gammaglobulin has been tried, but has not been demonstrated to be consistently effective. The theory is that patients with multiple relapses typically have low levels of antibodies to C. difficile toxins. By giving patients who relapse gammaglobulin. containing large amounts of antibodies to C. difficile toxins, the patients' levels of antibody to C. difficile toxins are increased. Pooled human gammaglobulin can be administered intravenously. However, this treatment is neither approved nor recommended. Active vaccination for C. difficile toxins. Vaccination can increase a patient's levels of antibodies to C. difficile toxins. This is a new treatment that has not become widely available."
What is new in C. diff?,"'The prevalence of ''C. difficile'' infection has been increasing steadily particularly in the elderly. There have been reports from several hospitals of a newer, more virulent strain of ''C. difficile'' bacteria that produces large amounts of both toxins A and B and as well as a third toxin. This strain produces more severe colitis than the usual ''strains''. Patients infected by this strain are more seriously ill, require surgery more frequently, and die from the infection more frequently than patients infected with the usual strains. Currently, the commercially available diagnostic tests cannot distinguish this strain from the usual strains.''Traditionally, antibiotic use is often considered the most important factor for the development of ''C. difficile'' colitis. Increasingly though doctors are diagnosing ''C. difficile colitis'"" in patients without previous antibiotic exposure. This is especially true in patients with Crohn's disease or ""'ulcerative colitis''. In one study of 92 patients with ''ulcerative colitis'"" and Crohn's disease relapse, 10 patients tested positive for ""'C. difficile''. Another change that is occurring with ''C. difficile'' infection is that it is no longer restricted to patients in hospitals or nursing homes. A study of data from 2009 through 2011 found community-associated ''C. difficile'' infections represent about one third of all ''C. difficile'' colitis cases. Traditionally, antibiotic use is often considered the most important factor for the development of ''C. difficile'' colitis, but in this study, 36% of the patients had not been treated with antibiotics.''Doctors are witnessing increasing difficulty in treating ''C. difficile'' colitis. Firstly, resistance to metronidazole is on the rise. Secondly, colitis (along with symptoms of diarrhea and cramps) is taking longer to resolve and may require higher doses of vancomycin. Thirdly ''C. difficile'' colitis relapse (with recurrent diarrhea) is common. More troublesome still, many patients experience multiple relapses, often requiring prolonged (months) antibiotic (such as vancomycin) treatment.' "
What is dysphagia?,"'Dysphagia is the medical term for the symptom of difficulty swallowing, derived from the Latin and Greek words meaning difficulty eating.''Swallowing is a complex action.''Considering its complexity, it is no wonder that swallowing, beginning with the contraction of the upper pharynx, has been ""automated,"" meaning that no thought is required for swallowing once swallowing is initiated. Swallowing is controlled by automatic reflexes that involve nerves within the pharynx and esophagus as well as a swallowing center in the brain that is connected to the pharynx and esophagus by nerves. (A reflex is a mechanism that is used to control many organs. Reflexes require nerves within an organ such as the esophagus to sense what is happening in that organ and to send the information to other nerves in the wall of the organ or outside the organ. The information is processed in these other nerves, and appropriate responses to conditions in the organ are determined. Then, still other nerves send messages from the processing nerves back to the organ to control the function of the organ, for example, the contraction of the muscles of the organ. In the case of swallowing, processing of reflexes primarily occurs in nerves within the wall of the pharynx and esophagus as well as the brain.)''The complexity of swallowing also explains why there are so many causes of dysphagia. Problems can occur with:''The problems may lie within the pharynx or esophagus, for example, with the physical narrowing of the pharynx or esophagus. Dysphagia also may be due to diseases of the muscles or the nerves that control the muscles of the pharynx and esophagus or damage to the swallowing center in the brain. Finally, the pharynx and the upper third of the esophagus contain muscle that is the same as the muscles that we use voluntarily (such as our arm muscles) called skeletal muscle. The lower two-thirds of the esophagus is composed of a different type of muscle known as smooth muscle. Thus, diseases that affect primarily skeletal muscle or smooth muscle in the body can affect the pharynx and esophagus, adding additional possibilities to the causes of dysphagia.''There are two symptoms that are often thought of as problems with swallowing (dysphagia) that probably are not. These symptoms are odynophagia and globus sensation.''Odynophagia means painful swallowing. Sometimes it is not easy for individuals to distinguish between odynophagia and dysphagia. For example, food that sticks in the esophagus often is painful. Is this dysphagia or odynophagia or both? Technically it is dysphagia, but individuals may describe it as painful swallowing (i.e., odynophagia). Moreover, patients with ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'') may describe dysphagia when what they really have is odynophagia. The ''pain'' that they feel after swallowing resolves when the inflammation of GERD is treated and disappears and is presumably due to ''pain'' caused by food passing through the inflamed portion of the esophagus.''Odynophagia also may occur with other conditions associated with inflammation of the esophagus, for example, viral and ''fungal infections''. It is important to distinguish between dysphagia and odynophagia because the causes of each may be quite different.''A globus sensation refers to a sensation that there is a lump in the throat. The lump may be present continuously or only when swallowing. The causes of a globus sensation are varied, and frequently no cause is found. Globus sensation has been attributed variously to abnormal function of the nerves or muscles of the pharynx and GERD. The globus sensation usually is described clearly by individuals and infrequently causes ''confusion'' with true dysphagia.'   Food is first chewed well in the mouth and mixed with saliva. The tongue then propels the chewed food into the throat (pharynx). The soft palate elevates to prevent the food from entering the posterior end of the nasal passages, and the upper pharynx contracts, pushing the food (referred to as a bolus) into the lower pharynx. At the same time, the voice box (larynx) is pulled upwards by muscles in the neck, and, as a result, the epiglottis bends downwards. This dual action closes off the opening to the larynx and windpipe (trachea) and prevents passing food from entering the larynx and trachea. The contraction of the muscular pharynx continues as a progressing, circumferential wave into the lower pharynx pushing the food along. A ring of muscle that encircles the upper end of the esophagus, known as the upper esophageal sphincter, relaxes, allowing the wave of contraction to push the food from the lower pharynx on into the esophagus. (When there is no swallow effort, the muscle of the upper sphincter is continuously contracted, closing off the esophagus from the pharynx and preventing anything within the esophagus from regurgitating back up into the pharynx.) The wave of contraction, referred to as a peristaltic wave, progresses from the pharynx down the entire length of the esophagus. Shortly after the bolus enters the upper esophagus, a specialized ring of muscle encircling the lower end of the esophagus where it meets the stomach, known as the lower esophageal sphincter, relaxes so that when the bolus arrives it can pass on into the stomach. (When there is no swallow the muscle of the lower sphincter is continuously contracted, closing off the esophagus from the stomach and preventing contents of the stomach from regurgitating back up into the esophagus.) After the bolus passes, the lower sphincter tightens again to prevent contents of the stomach from regurgitating back up into the esophagus. It remains tight until the next bolus comes along. the conscious initiation of swallowing, propulsion of food into the pharynx, closing of the nasal passages or larynx, opening of the upper or lower esophageal sphincters, physical blockage to the passage of food, and transit of the bolus by peristalsis through the body of the esophagus."
What causes swollowing problems?,"'As discussed previously, there are many causes of dysphagia. For convenience, causes of dysphagia can be classified into two groups;''Causes also can be classified differently into several groups.'   oropharyngeal (meaning that the cause is a problem in the mouth or pharynx) and esophageal."
Physical obstruction of the pharynx or esophagus," Benign and malignant tumors of the pharynx and esophagus. Most commonly these tumors are malignant. Tumors of the tissues surrounding the pharynx and esophagus. These tumors can compress the pharynx and esophagus leading to obstruction. This is an unusual cause of dysphagia. An example would be thyroid cancer. Narrowing (strictures) of the esophagus. The strictures usually are due to GERD and are located in the lower esophagus. These strictures are the result of ulcerations of the esophagus that heal, with scarring as a result. Less common causes of strictures include ingestion of acid or lye during attempts at suicide, some pill medications that may stick in the esophagus and cause ulceration and scarring, for example,potassium chloride ( K-Dur, K-Lor, K-Tab, Kaon CL, Klorvess, Slow-K, Ten-K, Klotrix, K-Lyte CL), doxycycline (Vibramycin, Oracea, Adoxa, Atridox and others),quinidine (Quinidine Gluconate, Quinidine Sulfate), biphosphonates used for treating osteoporosis), radiation therapy, and infections of the lower esophagus, particularly in people with AIDS. Schatzki's rings. These rings are benign, very short narrowings (millimeters in size) at the lower end of the esophagus. The cause of Schatzki's rings is unknown though some physicians believe they are caused by GERD. Infiltrating diseases of the esophagus. The most common infiltrative disease is a disease in which the wall of the esophagus fills with eosinophils, a type of white blood cell involved in inflammation. This disease is called eosinophilic esophagitis. The wall of the esophagus becomes stiff and cannot stretch as the bolus of food passes. As a result, the bolus sticks. Diverticuli (outpouchings) of the pharynx or esophagus. The diverticuli can expand when it fills with swallowed food and can compress the pharynx or esophagus. The diverticuli can be at the upper end of the esophagus (Zenker's diverticulum) or, less commonly, at the middle or lower end of the esophagus. Cricopharyngeal bars. These bars represent a part of the upper esophageal sphincter that has hypertrophied, that is, expanded. The bar does not stretch normally as the bolus passes. The cause of cricopharyngeal bars is unclear. Small bars that do not interfere with swallowing are quite common. Cervical osteophytes. Rarely, arthritis of the neck results in an overgrowth of bone that extends anteriorly out from a vertebra (an osteophyte). Since the vertebrae of the neck lie immediately behind the lower pharynx and uppermost esophagus, the osteophyte may impinge on the pharynx and esophagus. Congenital abnormalities of the esophagus. These abnormalities are present from birth and are almost always discovered in infants because of problems when oral feeding begins."
Diseases of the brain," Stroke. The most common disease affecting swallowing is a stroke (cerebrovascular accidents) that affect the swallowing center. Tumors of the brainstem. These tumors interfere with the transmission of nerves that carry information between the esophagus and the swallowing center in the brain. Degenerative diseases of the brain. The three most common degenerative diseases are Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Degenerative diseases of the motor nerves. Motor nerves are nerves that control the contraction of skeletal muscle. Poliomyelitis (polio, caused by a virus) is an example of a degenerative disease of motor nerves in the brain that impairs swallowing by interfering with the control of skeletal muscle in the pharynx."
Diseases of the smooth muscle of the esophagus," Achalasia. Achalasia is a condition that affects the smooth muscle portion of the esophagus, that is, the lower esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter. Specifically, the peristaltic wave disappears, and the lower sphincter does not relax. As a result of this ""double whammy,"" the food bolus sticks in the esophagus. With prolonged obstruction the esophagus enlarges (dilates) causing additional problems. The cause of achalasia is not clear but probably involves abnormalities of the nerves within the smooth muscle that lead to abnormal function of the muscle. In one sense, therefore, achalasia may be considered primarily a neurological problem. There is a parasitic infectious disease, called Chagas disease that mimics achalasia and occurs with a higher prevalence among individuals from Central and South America. In Chagas disease, the parasite appears to destroy the nerves that control the smooth muscle. Ineffective peristalsis. Ineffective peristalsis is not really a disease but rather a condition in which the force of the peristaltic wave of contraction is reduced to the point that the wave no longer is strong enough to push the bolus of food through the esophagus and into the stomach. By itself, ineffective peristalsis usually does not cause a serious problem. The reason for this is that almost all meals are eaten in the upright position, and the effect of gravity on the bolus provides an additional and important force that alone can propel most boluses into the stomach. Severe problems only occur when a second impediment to passage of the bolus occurs such as a stricture of the esophagus. Ineffective peristalsis usually occurs by itself but it may be associated with other diseases such as collagen-vascular diseases (for example, scleroderma) and diabetes. Theoretically, ineffective peristalsis could be due to either muscular or neurological problems within the smooth muscle. Spastic motility disorders. Spastic motility disorders are a group of conditions of unknown cause in which contractions of the esophagus are not orderly. Rather than a progressing, peristaltic wave, contraction of all or a large portion of the esophagus is simultaneous (spastic), and thus the bolus of food is not propelled forward. Other disorders that are classified with the spastic disorders include peristaltic pressures that are abnormally high and spontaneous contractions of the esophagus, that is, contractions that are not triggered by a swallow. In addition to dysphagia, the spastic motility disorders may cause severe chest pain mimicking heart pain (angina) that occurs spontaneously, that is, unassociated with eating. The most common spastic disorder is referred to as ""nutcracker"" esophagus, a term that emphasizes the appearance of the esophagus on X-rays that is due to very high peristaltic pressures rather than spasm. The second most common spastic disorder is diffuse esophageal spasm, a name that emphasizes the spasm."
Diseases of skeletal muscle of the pharynx," Polymyositis. Polymyositis is a disease of unknown cause in which skeletal muscle becomes inflamed and degenerates. It can affect skeletal muscle of the body as well as the pharynx. Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is a disease in which there is abnormal transmission of signals between motor nerves and the skeletal muscles they control. The skeletal muscle of the pharynx may be affected. Muscular dystrophies. The muscular dystrophies are a group of inherited (genetic) diseases that are caused by the production of abnormal proteins in skeletal muscle cells. The abnormal proteins result in degeneration of the muscle cells and their replacement with scar tissue or fat. The primary symptoms of the muscular dystrophies are muscle weakness and spasm. Examples of muscular dystrophies include myotonic dystrophy, Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, and Becker's muscular dystrophy. Metabolic myopathies. Metabolic myopathies are a group of rare, inherited (genetic) diseases that are caused by a deficiency in activity of the enzymes in skeletal muscle cells that are important for generating the energy that is necessary for contraction of the muscle. The most common symptom of the metabolic myopathies is easy tiring of muscles and muscle cramps."
Miscellaneous diseases," Reduced saliva. Saliva facilitates swallowing by acting as lubrication for the bolus. Some medications, diseases (for example, Sjogren's syndrome), and radiation therapy to the head and neck that affects the salivary glands, all reduce the production of saliva, and can cause dysphagia, though usually it is mild. Alzheimer's disease"
Swallowing-related symptoms,"'With neurological problems, there may be difficulty initiating a swallow because the bolus cannot be propelled by the tongue into the throat. Elderly individuals with ''dentures'' may not chew their food well and therefore swallow large pieces of solid food that get stuck. (Nevertheless, this usually occurs when there is an additional problem within the pharynx or esophagus such as a stricture.) ''The most common swallowing symptom of dysphagia, however, is the sensation that swallowed food is sticking, either in the lower neck or the chest. If food sticks in the throat, there may be ''coughing'' or choking with ''expectoration'"" of the swallowed food. If food enters the larynx, more severe coughing and choking will be provoked. If the soft palate is not working and doesn't properly seal off the nasal passages, food—particularly liquids--can regurgitate into the nose with the swallow. Sometimes, food may come back up into the mouth immediately after being swallowed.""  "
Non-swallowing-related,"'Food that sticks in the esophagus may remain there for prolonged periods of time. This may create a sensation of the chest filling up as more food is eaten and result in an individual having to stop eating and possibly drinking liquids in an attempt to wash the food down. The inability to eat larger amounts of food may lead to loss of weight. In addition, the food that remains in the esophagus may regurgitate from the esophagus at night while the individual is sleeping, and the individual might be awakened by coughing or choking in the middle of the night that is provoked by the regurgitating food. If food enters the larynx, trachea, and/or ''lungs'', it may provoke episodes of ''asthma'' and even lead to infection of the lungs and aspiration\xa0''pneumonia''. Recurrent ''pneumonia'' can lead to serious, permanent, and progressive injury to the lungs. Occasionally, individuals are not awakened from ''sleep'' by the regurgitating food but awaken in the morning to find regurgitated food on their pillow.''Individuals who retain food in their esophagus may complain of ''heartburn''-like (GERD) symptoms. Their symptoms may indeed be due to GERD but are more likely due to the retained food and do not respond well to treatment for GERD.''With the spastic motility disorders, individuals may develop episodes of ''chest pain'' that may be so severe as to mimic a ''heart attack'' and cause the individuals to go to the emergency room. The cause of the pain with the spastic esophageal disorders is unclear although the leading theory is that it is due to spasm of the esophageal muscles.' "
How causes swallowing problems?,"'Odynophagia and globus sensation. ''The occasional difficulty in distinguishing dysphagia from odynophagia already has been discussed, as well as the difference between dysphagia and a globus sensation.''Tracheo-esophageal fistula.'' One disorder that can be confused with dysphagia is tracheo-esophageal fistula. A tracheo-esophageal fistula is an open communication between the esophagus and the trachea that often develops due to ''cancers'' of the esophagus but which may also occur as a congenital (inborn) birth defect. Swallowed food may provoke coughing that mimics the coughing due to dysfunction of the muscles of the pharynx that allows food to enter the larynx; however, in the case of a fistula, the coughing is due to the passage of food from the esophagus through the fistula and into the trachea.''Rumination syndrome.'' Rumination syndrome is a syndrome in which food regurgitates effortlessly back into the mouth after a meal is completed. It usually occurs in younger women and conceivably could be confused with dysphagia. There is no sensation of food sticking after swallowing, however.''Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).'' People with more severe GERD may have food regurgitate from the stomach into the esophagus or mouth, particularly when activities increase pressure in the abdomen, for example, with coughing and bending. Regurgitation also may occur at night while persons with GERD are sleeping as in those with swallowing disorders who have food collect in their esophagus.''Heart disease''.'' The spastic motility disorders that cause dysphagia can be associated with spontaneous chest pain, that is, chest pain not associated with swallowing. Despite the presence of dysphagia, spontaneous chest pain always must be assumed to be due to ''heart disease'' until heart disease has been excluded as the cause of the chest pain. Therefore, it is important to test carefully for heart disease before considering the esophagus as the cause of chest pain when a patient with dysphagia complains of episodes of spontaneous chest pain.' "
What tests and procedures diagnose the cause of swallowing problems?,"'The history from an individual with dysphagia often provides important clues to the underlying cause of the dysphagia.''The nature of the symptom or symptoms provides the most important clues to the cause of dysphagia. Swallowing that is difficult to initiate or that leads to nasal regurgitation, ''cough'', or choking is most likely due to an oral or pharyngeal problem. Swallowing that results in the sensation of food sticking in the chest (esophagus) is most likely due to an esophageal problem.''Dysphagia that progresses rapidly over weeks or a few months suggests a ''malignant tumor''. Dysphagia for solid food alone suggests a physical obstruction to the passage of food, whereas dysphagia for both solid and liquid food is more likely to be caused by a disease of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. Intermittent symptoms also are more likely to be caused by diseases of smooth muscle than obstruction of the esophagus since dysfunction of the muscle often is intermittent.''Preexisting diseases also provide clues. Those with diseases of skeletal muscle (for example, polymyositis), the brain (most commonly ''stroke''), or the nervous system are more likely to have dysphagia on the basis of dysfunction of the oropharyngeal muscles and nerves. People with collagen vascular diseases, for example, ''scleroderma'', are more likely to have problems with the esophageal muscles, especially ineffective peristalsis.''Patients with a history of GERD are more likely to have esophageal strictures as the cause of their dysphagia, though about 20% of patients with strictures have minimal or no ''symptoms of GERD'' before the onset of dysphagia. It is believed that reflux that occurs at night is more injurious to the esophagus. There also is a higher risk of ''esophageal cancer'' among individuals with long-standing GERD.''Loss of weight can be a sign of either severe dysphagia or a malignant ''tumor''. More often than losing weight, people describe a change in their eating pattern—smaller bites, additional chewing—that prolongs meals so that they are the last one at the table to finish eating. This latter pattern, if present for a prolonged period of time, suggests a non-malignant, relatively stable or slowly progressive cause for the dysphagia. Episodes of chest pain that are not due to heart disease suggest muscular diseases of the esophagus. Birth and residence in Central or South America is associated with Chagas disease.''The physical examination is of limited value in suggesting causes for dysphagia. Abnormalities of the neurological examination suggest neurologic or muscle diseases. By observing an individual swallowing, one can determine if there is difficulty in initiating swallows, a sign of neurological disease. Tumors in the neck suggest the possibility of compression of the pharynx. A trachea that cannot be moved from side to side with the hand suggests a tumor lower down in the chest that has entrapped the trachea and possibly the esophagus. Observing atrophy (reduced size) or fasiculations of the tongue (fine ''tremors'') also suggest diseases of the nervous system or skeletal muscle.''Endoscopy. '' Endoscopy involves the insertion of a long (one meter), flexible tube with a light and camera on its end through the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, and into the stomach. The lining of the pharynx and esophagus can be evaluated visually, and biopsies (small pieces of tissue) can be obtained for examination under the microscope or for bacterial or viral cultures.'""Endoscopy is an excellent means of diagnosing tumors, strictures, and Schatzki's rings as well as infections of the esophagus. It also is very good for diagnosing diverticuli of the middle and lower esophagus but poor for diagnosing diverticuli in the upper esophagus (Zenker's diverticulum).""'It is possible to observe abnormalities of esophageal muscular contraction, but esophageal manometry is a test that is much better suited for evaluating function of the esophageal muscles. Resistance passing the endoscope through the lower esophageal sphincter combined with a lack of esophageal contractions is a fairly reliable sign of achalasia or Chagas disease (due to the inability of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax), but it is important when there is resistance to exclude the presence of a stricture or ''cancer'' which also can cause resistance. Finally, there is a characteristic appearance of the esophageal lining when infiltrated with eosinophils that strongly suggests the presence of eosinophilic ''esophagitis''.''X-rays.'' There are two different types of X-rays that can be done to diagnose the cause of dysphagia. The ''barium swallow'"" or esophagram is the simplest type. For the barium swallow, mouthfuls of barium are swallowed, and X-ray films are taken of the esophagus at several points in time while the bolus of barium traverses the esophagus. The barium swallow is excellent for diagnosing moderate-to-severe external compression, tumors, and strictures of the esophagus. Occasionally, however, Schatzki's rings can be missed.""""Another type of X-ray study that can be done to evaluate swallowing is the video esophagram or video swallow, sometimes called a video-fluoroscopic swallowing study. For the video swallow, instead of several static X-ray images of the bolus traversing the esophagus, a video X-ray is taken. The video study can be reviewed frame by frame and is able to show much more than the barium swallow. This usually is not important for diagnosing tumors or strictures, which are well seen on barium swallow, but it is more effective for suggesting problems with the contraction of the muscles of the esophagus and pharynx (though esophageal manometry, discussed later, is still better for studying contraction), milder external compression of the esophagus, and Schatzki's rings. The video study can be extended to include the pharynx where it is the best method for demonstrating osteophytes, cricopharyngeal bars, and Zenker's diverticuli. A modified barium swallow is a version of the test evaluating the oropharyngeal phases of swallowing. A speech pathologist is usually involved with the evaluation to determine subtle sequence and phase abnormalities.""'The video swallow also is excellent for diagnosing penetration of barium (the equivalent of food) into the larynx and trachea due to neurological and muscular problems of the pharynx that may be causing coughing or choking after swallowing food.''Esophageal manometry.'' Esophageal manometry, also known as esophageal motility testing, is a means to evaluate the function of pharyngeal and esophageal muscles. For manometry, a thin, flexible catheter is passed through the nose and pharynx and into the esophagus. The catheter is able to sense pressure at multiple locations along its length in both the pharynx and the esophagus. When the pharyngeal and esophageal muscles contract, they generate a pressure on the catheter which is sensed, measured and recorded from each location. The magnitude of the pressure at each pressure-sensing location and the timing of the increases in pressure at each location in relation to other locations give an accurate picture of how the muscles of the pharynx and esophagus are contracting.''The value of manometry is in diagnosing and differentiating among diseases of the muscle or the nerves controlling the muscles that result in muscle dysfunction of the pharynx and esophagus. Thus, it is useful for diagnosing the swallowing dysfunction caused by diseases of the brain, skeletal muscle of the pharynx, and smooth muscle of the esophagus.''Esophageal impedence.'' Esophageal impedence testing utilizes catheters similar to those used for esophageal manometry. Impedence testing, however, senses the flow of the bolus through the esophagus. Thus, it is possible to determine how well the bolus is traversing the esophagus and correlate the movement with concomitantly recorded esophageal pressures determined by manometry. (It also can be used to sense reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus among patients with GERD.) Multiple sites along the length of the esophagus can be tested to assess the movement of the bolus and presence of reflux, including how high up it extends.''Esophageal acid testing.'' Esophageal acid testing is not a test that directly diagnoses diseases of the esophagus. Rather, it is a method for determining whether or not there is reflux of acid from the stomach into the esophagus, a cause of the most common esophageal problem leading to dysphagia, esophageal stricture. For acid testing, a thin catheter is inserted through the nose, down the throat, and into the esophagus. At the tip of the catheter and placed just above the junction of the esophagus with the stomach is an acid-sensing probe. The catheter coming out of the nose passes back over the ear and down to the waist where it is attached to a recorder. Each time acid refluxes (regurgitates) from the stomach and into the esophagus it hits the probe, and the reflux of acid is recorded by the recorder. At the end of a prolonged period, usually 24 hours, the catheter is removed and the information from the recorder is downloaded into a computer for analysis. Most people have a small amount of reflux of acid, but individuals with GERD have more. Thus, acid testing can determine if GERD is likely to be the cause of the esophageal problem such as a stricture, as well as if treatment of GERD is adequate by showing the amount of acid that refluxes during treatment is normal.''An alternative method of esophageal acid testing uses a small capsule containing an acid-sensing probe that is attached to the esophageal lining just above the junction of the esophagus with the stomach. The capsule wirelessly transmits the presence of episodes of acid regurgitation to a receiver carried on the chest. The capsule records for two or three days and later is shed into the esophagus and passes out of the body in the ''stool''.''Other tests\xa0''The diagnosis of muscular dystrophies and metabolic myopathies usually involves a combination of tests including blood tests that can suggest muscle injury, electromyograms to determine if nerves and muscles are working normally, biopsies of muscles, and genetic testing.' "
How are swollowing problems treated?,"'The treatment of dysphagia varies and depends on the cause of the dysphagia. One option for supporting patients either transiently or long-term until the cause of the dysphagia resolves is a feeding tube. The tube for feeding may be passed nasally into the stomach or through the abdominal wall into the stomach or small intestine. Once oral feeding resumes, the tube can be removed.''Treatment for obstruction of the pharynx or esophagus requires removal of the obstruction.''Tumors usually are removed surgically although occasionally they can be removed endoscopically, totally or partially. Radiation therapy and ''chemotherapy'' also may be used particularly for malignant tumors of the pharynx and its surrounding tissues. If malignant tumors of the esophagus cannot be easily removed or the tumor has spread and survival will be limited, swallowing can be improved by placing ''stents'' within the esophagus across the area of obstruction. Occasionally, obstructing tumors can be dilated the same way as strictures. (See below.)'""Strictures and Schatzki's rings usually are treated with endoscopic dilation, a procedure in which the narrowed area is stretched either by a long, semi-rigid tube passed through the mouth or a balloon that is blown up inside the esophagus.""'The most common infiltrating disease causing dysphagia is eosinophilic esophagitis which usually is successfully treated with swallowed ''corticosteroids''. The role of ''food allergy'' as a cause of eosinophilic esophagitis is debated; however, there are reports of using elimination diets to identify specific foods that are associated with ''allergy''. Elimination of these foods has been reported to prevent or reverse the infiltration of the esophagus with eosinophils, particularly in children.''Diverticuli of the pharynx and esophagus usually are treated surgically by excising them. Occasionally they can be treated endoscopically. Cricopharyngeal bars are treated surgically by cutting the thickened muscle. Osteophytes also can be removed surgically.''Congenital abnormalities of the esophagus usually are treated surgically soon after birth so that oral feeding can resume.''As previously discussed, ''strokes'' are the most common disease of the brain to cause dysphagia. Dysphagia usually is at its worst immediately after the ''stroke'', and often the dysphagia improves with time and even may disappear. If it does not disappear, swallowing is evaluated, usually with a video swallowing study. The exact abnormality of function can be defined and different maneuvers can be performed to see if they can counter the effects of the dysfunction. For example, in some patients it is possible to prevent aspiration of food by turning the head to the side when swallowing or by drinking thickened liquids (since thin liquids is the food most likely to be aspirated).'""Tumors of the brain, in some cases, can be removed surgically; however, it is unlikely that surgery will reverse the dysphagia. Parkinson's disease and ""'multiple sclerosis'' can be treated with ''drugs'' and may be useful in patients with dysphagia.''Achalasia is treated like a stricture of the esophagus with dilation, usually with a balloon. A second option is surgical treatment in which the muscle of the lower esophageal sphincter is cut (a myotomy) in order to reduce the pressure and obstruction caused by the non-relaxing sphincter. Drugs that relax the sphincter usually have little or a transient effect and are useful only when achalasia is mild.''An option for individuals who are at high risk for surgery or balloon dilation is injection of botulinin toxin into the sphincter. The toxin paralyzes the muscle of the sphincter and causes the pressure within the sphincter to decrease. The effects of botulinin toxin are transient, however, and repeated injections usually are necessary. It is best to treat achalasia early before the obstruction causes the esophagus to enlarge (dilate) which can lead to additional problems such as food collecting above the sphincter with regurgitation and aspiration.''In other spastic motility disorders, several drugs may be tried, including anti-cholinergic medications, peppermint, ''nitroglycerin'', and ''calcium channel blockers'', but the effectiveness of these drugs is not clear and studies with them are nonexistent or limited.''For patients with severe and uncontrollable symptoms of pain and/or dysphagia, a surgical procedure called a long myotomy occasionally is performed. A long myotomy is similar to the surgical treatment for achalasia but the cut in the muscle is extended up along the body of the esophagus for a variable distance in an attempt to reduce pressures and obstruction to the bolus.''There is no treatment for ineffective peristalsis, and individuals must change their eating habits. Fortunately, ineffective peristalsis infrequently causes severe dysphagia by itself. When moderate or severe dysphagia is associated with ineffective peristalsis it is important to be certain that there is no additional obstruction of the esophagus, for example, by a stricture due to GERD, that is adding to the effects of reduced muscle function and making dysphagia worse than the ineffective peristalsis alone. Most causes of obstruction can be treated.''There are effective drug therapies for polymyositis and myasthenia gravis that should also improve associated dysphagia. Treatment of the muscular dystrophies is primarily directed at preventing deformities of the joints that commonly occur and lead to immobility, but there are no therapies that affect the dysphagia. Corticosteroids and drugs that suppress immunity sometimes are used to treat some of the muscular dystrophies, but their effectiveness has not been demonstrated.''There is no treatment for the metabolic myopathies other than changes in lifestyle and ''diet''.''Diseases that reduce the production of saliva can be treated with artificial saliva or ''over-the-counter'' and prescription drugs that stimulate the production of saliva.''There is no treatment for '""Alzheimer's""' disease.'  "
What is the prognosis for dysphagia?,"'With the exception of dysphagia caused by stroke for which there can be marked improvement, dysphagia from other causes is stable or progressive, and the prognosis depends on the underlying cause, its tendency to progress, the availability of therapy, and the response to therapy.' In general, the prognosis for non-malignant obstruction of the esophagus is good with treatment. Even dysphagia caused by malignant obstruction can be palliated with endoscopic resection of part of the tumor and/or stenting. Neurologic and muscular diseases causing dysphagia are a mixed bag. Treatment of achalasia is quite effective, treatment for spastic motility disorders much less so. As mentioned previously, ineffective peristalsis by itself usually does not cause important or progressive dysphagia. Progressive neurologic and skeletal muscle diseases are the most difficult to treat and carry the worst prognosis."
What does the future offer for dysphagia?,"'Recent developments in the diagnostic arena are beginning to bring new insights into esophageal function, specifically, high resolution and 3D manometry, and ''endoscopic ultrasound''.''High resolution and 3D manometry''High resolution and 3D manometry are extensions of standard manometry that utilize similar catheters. The difference is that the pressure-sensing locations on the catheters are very close together and ring the catheter. Recording of pressures from so many locations gives an extremely detailed picture of how esophageal muscle is contracting. The primary value of these diagnostic procedures is that they ""integrate"" the activities of the esophagus so that the overall pattern of swallowing can be recognized, which is particularly important in complex motility disorders. In addition, their added detail allows the recognition of subtle abnormalities and hopefully will be able to help define the clinical importance of subtle abnormalities of muscle contraction associated with lesser degrees of dysphagia.''Endoscopic ultrasonography has been available for many years but has recently been applied to the evaluation of esophageal muscle diseases. ''Ultrasound'' uses sound waves to penetrate tissues. The sound waves are reflected by the tissues and structures they encounter, and, when analyzed, the reflections give information about the tissues and structures from which they are reflected. In the esophagus, endoscopic ultrasonography has been used to determine the extent of penetration of tumors into the esophageal wall and the presence of metastases to adjacent ''lymph nodes''. More recently, endoscopic ultrasonography has been used to obtain a detailed look at the muscles of the esophagus. What has been found is that in some disorders, particularly the spastic motility disorders, the muscle of the esophagus is thickened. Moreover, thickening of the muscle sometimes can be recognized only by ultrasonography even when spastic abnormalities are not seen with manometry. The exact role of endoscopic ultrasonography has not yet been determined but is an exciting area for future research.' "
Facts you should know about diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH)," DISH is characterized by unique, flowing calcification along the sides of the contiguous vertebrae of the spine. Symptoms of DISH include intermittent pains and stiffness in the areas of the bony changes of the spine and inflamed tendons. DISH is diagnosed when the characteristic flowing calcifications are detected with images of the spine, such as in plain film X-ray methods. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) can be helpful in both relieving pain and inflammation of DISH."
What is diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis?,"'Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis'' (DISH) is considered a form of ''degenerative arthritis'' or ''osteoarthritis''. However, DISH is characterized by unique, flowing calcification along the sides of the contiguous vertebrae of the spine. And, very unlike typical degenerative ''arthritis'"", it's also commonly associated with inflammation (tendinitis) and calcification of tendons at their attachments points to bone. This can lead to the formation of ""'bone spurs'', such as ''heel spurs'"". In fact, heel spurs are common among individuals with DISH. DISH has also been called Forestier's disease."" "
What causes diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis?,'It is not known what causes DISH. DISH is associated with the ''metabolic syndrome'' and is more frequent in people with ''diabetes mellitus''.' 
What are signs and symptoms of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis?,"'Symptoms of DISH include intermittent pains in the areas of the bony changes of the spine and inflamed tendons. Stiffness and dull ''pain'', particularly in the upper and lower back, are common. Sometimes pains in these areas can be sharp with certain body movements, such as twisting or bending over.''DISH is only slowly progressive. Calcifications between the vertebrae occur over many years. This calcification can lead to limitation of motion of the involved areas of the spine.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis?,"'DISH is diagnosed when the characteristic flowing calcifications are detected with images of the spine, such as in plain film X-ray methods.' "
What is the treatment for diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis?,"'Because areas of the spine and tendons can become inflamed, anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'') and ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), can be helpful in both relieving pain and inflammation of DISH. It is hoped that by minimizing inflammation in these areas, further calcification of tendons and ligaments of the spine leading to calcific bony outgrowths (''osteophytes'') will be prevented.'  "
What is the prognosis for patients with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis?,"'DISH often causes no symptoms, and the long-term outlook is generally good. DISH can lead to limitation of range of motion of the spine. There is no associated threat to any internal organs with this disorder. Rarely, large bone spurs can form in front of the spinal vertebrae of the neck. These spurs occasionally interfere with the passage of food through the upper ''esophagus'' (swallowing tube).' "
Is it possible to prevent diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis?,'There is no ''prevention'' of DISH.' 
"What is dilation and curettage (D and C, D&C)?","'Dilation and curettage (D and C) is a procedure in which the cervix of the uterus is expanded (dilated) so that the uterine lining (''endometrium'') can be removed with a spoon-shaped instrument called a curet or curette. The procedure is performed for a variety of reasons. Most commonly, this surgery is done in order to help determine the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding. It can also be done to help determine the degree of abnormality of the ''endometrium'' in ''cancer'' cases or pre-cancerous cells that are detected by an in-office biopsy. D and C are also sometimes necessary to remove tissue after a ''miscarriage''.'  "
Why do they perform a D and C?,"'In general, a D and C is used to help determine the health of the uterine lining or to remove abnormal tissue. Occasionally, the procedure can correct some of the problems in the uterus such as polyps, ''scar tissue'', or tissue overgrowth.'  "
What are reasons not to have a D and C?,"'There are very few contraindications to D and C. Generally, if a patient is too ill to undergo surgery, she should probably not have this procedure. Furthermore, if the patient is unable to move her legs apart, such as with severe ''arthritis'' in the hips, the surgeon may not be able to perform the procedure since it requires enough movement of the legs to accommodate a speculum. If the femal is ''pregnant'' or thinks that she could be pregnant, she should not have the operation unless the D and C is for the purpose of an abortion or to treat a miscarriage.' "
What happens before surgery?,"'Before a D and C, the same general recommendations for other outpatient procedures apply. It is recommended that the patient take nothing by mouth (food, water, etc.) for at least 6 to 8 hours prior to the scheduled operation. Often, the doctor will see the patient the day before surgery to discuss the procedure and potential complications in detail.' "
Are you awake during a D and C?,"'Most D and Cs are done under general anesthesia. The procedure is typically very short, and general anesthetic can be quickly reversed, with the patient going home later the same day. Some patients prefer or require spinal or epidural blocks, but these forms of anesthesia take more time for the anesthesiologist to perform and require more recovery time for the patient. Occasionally, in a very motivated patient, the procedure can be done under a local anesthetic with or without intravenous ''pain'' medication or twilight ''sleep''. Overall, the choice of anesthetic is a generally determined by the surgeon, the anesthesiologist, and the patient.' "
How is a D and C performed?,"'The D&C is done in a hospital operating room, surgery center, or a room in a doctor’s office that is specifically designated for the procedure. Once you have received anesthesia, you will be placed in a position (similar to that for a ''Pap smear''), and the vagina and cervix are cleansed with an antibacterial scrub (usually Betadine). An instrument is used to grasp the upper portion of the cervix, then gradually, the opening to the uterus is widened with metal dilators to about the size of a large pencil.''Once the dilation has been completed, the curette, which is an instrument with a flat metal loop at the end, is inserted into the uterine ''cavity'' and is used to gently scrape the lining of the uterus. When the surgeon feels the gritty layer of cells just above the muscle of the uterus, then he/she knows that the scraping has gone deep enough to sample the tissue adequately. This scraping is done throughout the uterus, and the tissue that is removed is then sent to a pathologist for microscopic examination.''After the surgeon feels that enough tissue has been obtained, that the entire uterine ''cavity'' has been sampled, or that any abnormal growths that were seen on ''ultrasound'' were removed, then the procedure is stopped. Often, the doctor uses a viewing instrument to examine the uterus visually (''hysteroscopy'') prior to the D and C to make the procedure more complete. This is not, however, always necessary.'  "
What are the possible complications of a D and C?,"'The D and C procedure has a low risk of serious complications. It is normal to experience ''vaginal bleeding'' and/or pelvic cramping (similar to menstrual cramping) for a few days following a D and C. Typically, ''over-the-counter'' ''pain'' medications are sufficient for pain control.''The most common complication that can occur is perforation of the uterus with either the dilators or the curette. When this happens, as long as no internal organs (''intestines'', bladder, or rectum) or large blood vessels are damaged, the hole will usually will heal itself without further surgery. The risk for this problem is increased in patients with a narrowed opening to the cervix (cervical stenosis) or in females with distorted internal uterine anatomy. This risk is also increased if the uterus is infected or has undergone previous surgeries such as cesarean sections or myomectomies.''Injury to the cervix is another possible complication. Tears or ''cuts'' in the cervix can usually be treated by application of pressure and application of local medications to stop bleeding. In some cases, ''stitches'' in the cervix may be required, but this is not common.''Other complications, as with any surgery, include bleeding and infection. Most bleeding is mild and resolves on its own. Infection is also rare and can normally be managed with oral antibiotics. Most D and Cs do not require the routine use of post-operative antibiotics. On occasion, in patients with certain ''heart'' defects, the surgeon may give the patient antibiotics before and after the surgery to prevent bacteria from the vagina from infecting the heart valves.'  "
What happens after a D and C?,"'After the surgery, the patient is cared for in a post-anesthesia care unit during recovery from the anesthesia. Most patients can return to normal activities within a few days. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications may be recommended to relieve the mild pain and cramping that may follow. To decrease the chance of developing an infection, doctors advise that patients not use tampons or insert anything into the vagina for two weeks following the surgery, and to abstain from sexual intercourse for the same time period.''The follow-up office care depends on the surgeon. Most doctors have the patient return to the office to make sure that all is well and to discuss the results of the tissue samples that were removed. Usually, this is done 2 to 6 weeks post-operatively. Sometimes, the patient will simply be notified by a phone call with the results, and no direct contact with a health professional is necessary.' "
Why is the D and C procedure becoming less common?,"'In general, the number of D and Cs being performed has declined over the years. This procedure is no longer done to regulate abnormal bleeding patterns in women. Most of these problems are now managed with medications, such as hormones. Ultrasound and other imaging techniques are likewise playing a greater role in helping to evaluate the uterus without surgery.''Probably the single greatest reason for fewer D and Cs is the option of in-office endometrial sampling (biopsy) that can be performed with a very thin ''plastic'' suction curette. This procedure is very quick and easy, and generally is only as painful as a bad menstrual cramp. If the patient is given some oral pain medications before the procedure, the ''cramps'' are minimal. Furthermore, the tissue sample obtained is in many instances as good as that achieved during a D and C surgery.' "
What is diphtheria?,"'Diphtheria is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium ''Corynebacterium diphtheriae'' species and is most often associated with a ''sore throat'', ''fever'', and the development of an adherent membrane on the mucous membranes of ''tonsils'' and/or the nasopharynx. Severe bacterial infection can affect other organ systems such as the heart and the nervous system, leading to ''heart failure'"" and nerve damage. In addition, some patients with diphtheria can also have skin infections. Exotoxin produced by the bacteria is an important component in causing diphtheria's more severe symptoms."" "
What are the symptoms and signs of diphtheria?,"'Initially the symptoms of diphtheria may be similar to a viral ''upper respiratory infection'' but symptoms worsen over about two to five days. The symptoms may include: ''As the disease progresses, an adherent membrane (pseudomembrane) may begin to cover the ''tonsils'', pharynx, and/or nasal tissues. If untreated, the pseudomembrane can extend into the larynx and trachea and obstruct the ''airway''; this can be life threatening and lead to death.''Cutaneous diphtheria symptoms include initial reddish lesions that are painful and that may develop into nonhealing ulcers. A gray-colored membrane may cover some ulcers.' a sore throat, fever (low grade), difficulty swallowing, weakness, hoarseness, headache, enlarged lymph nodes (swollen glands) producing a thick or ""bull"" neck (resembling mumps), cough, and difficulty breathing."
What is the history of diphtheria?,"'Diphtheria has infected humans for centuries. Hippocrates produced the first documented description of diphtheria in the fifth century BC. The disease has been a leader in causing death, especially in children, for many centuries. P. Bretonneau named ''typhus'"" in 1826. The bacteria were first identified in the 1880s by F. Loffler and E. Klebs. In the 1890s, medical professionals discovered exotoxins. Health researchers produced the first diphtheria toxoid vaccine in the 1920s. Vaccination programs have decreased the incidence of diphtheria worldwide, however, when vaccination rates drop, infection rates of diphtheria rise and, occasionally, serious outbreaks of the disease occur. For example, in the 1990s, an epidemic in Russia caused about 5,000 deaths according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) statistics, and from 1993-2003, Latvia reported 101 deaths from diphtheria.""'Before the diphtheria vaccination program, there were 100,000 to 200,000 cases of diphtheria each year in the U.S., leading to approximately 15,000 to 20,000 deaths. According to the CDC, there have been less than five cases reported cases in the U.S. in the last 10 years. However, in May 2018, the WHO (World Health Organization) gave an update on diphtheria; Columbia, Haiti, Venezuela, reported confirmed diphtheria infections. In 2017, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Venezuela reported confirmed infections.' "
What causes diphtheria?,"'The cause of diphtheria is bacterial species termed ''Corynebacterium diphtheriae'', a gram-positive bacillus that usually produces exotoxins. There are four main strains (biotypes) of ''C. diphtheriae'':''The strain termed intermedius is most often associated with exotoxin production although all three strains are capable of producing exotoxin.' gravis, intermedius, mitis, and belfanti. The organisms easily invade the tissue lining the throat, and during that invasion, they produce exotoxins that destroy the tissue and lead to the development of a pseudomembrane. Non-toxin-producing strains and other Corynebacterium species such as C. ulcerans can still cause infection, but infection is less severe and sometimes remains only in the skin (cutaneous infection) and may resemble a measles rash."
How do you get diphtheria?,"'Because human carriers or symptomatic individuals are the main reservoir for infection, situations such as''Diphtheria spreads by ''inhalation'' of airborne droplets or by direct contact with infected patients by mucous secretions or skin ulcerations. Some people may carry the bacteria in their respiratory tracts (termed carriers) but do not exhibit disease. However, such individuals can still transmit the organisms to uninfected individuals.' overcrowding (dormitories, institutional housing, poor living conditions), incomplete immunization, and people who are immunocompromised are at higher risk for getting diphtheria."
How do physicians diagnose diphtheria?,"""Physicians make a preliminary diagnosis of diphtheria from the patient's history and physical exam and the presence of a pseudomembrane formation in the throat especially if there is a history of not receiving vaccination. Medical professionals base their confirmation on isolation of the organism from swab specimens taken from the throat or from skin lesions. However, because diphtheria can be lethal, the CDC recommends immediate treatment if diphtheria suspected; do not wait for laboratory confirmation."" "
What is the treatment for diphtheria?,"'There are two treatment strategies that are used for patients diagnosed with diphtheria. Both are most effective when utilized early in the disease process. The first treatment is antibiotics. The CDC recommends ''erythromycin'' as the first-line therapy for patients older than 6 months of age. For patients who are younger or who cannot take erythromycin, the CDC recommends intramuscular ''penicillin''. Patients usually become noninfectious after about 48 hours of antibiotic treatment, and medical professionals should isolate patients until that time to prevent spread of the disease.'""The second treatment is administration of diphtheria antitoxin. However, this antitoxin is only available from the CDC. Diphtheria antitoxin reduces the progression of the disease by binding diphtheria toxin that has not yet attached to the body's cells. The antitoxin comes from horses, so recipients should not be treated if they are ""'allergic''. Your doctor will make the decision if you need only antibiotics or antibiotics plus antitoxin based on your symptoms, immunization status, and disease progression.'  "
What are possible complications of diphtheria?,"'The worst possible complication of diphtheria is respiratory failure or death due to pseudomembrane formation that blocks the airway. Other possible complications include cardiac problems such as rhythm disturbances, ''myocarditis'', ''heart block'', secondary ''pneumonia'', ''septic shock'', and infection of other organs such as the spleen, central nervous system, or heart tissue.' "
What is the prognosis of diphtheria?,"'The prognosis of diphtheria ranges from good to poor, depending upon how early in the infection the patient is treated, and how the patient responds to treatment. If the patient develops sepsis or ''bacteremia'"", or if there's cardiac involvement, the prognosis is usually poor. The mortality (death) rate is highest in patients less than 5 years old and in patients that are older than 40. The average rate of death from diphtheria is about 5%-10%."" "
Is it possible to prevent diphtheria? Is there a diphtheria vaccine?,"'Diphtheria is one of the vaccine-preventable diseases; the most effective way to prevent diphtheria is to vaccinate people (infants, see below) early in their lives and to prevent infected individuals from coming in close contact with uninfected and/or non-immunized people. In addition, an infected person who is a carrier of the bacteria can be treated with antibiotics to eliminate the bacteria and thus reduce the chance of carriers transmitting bacteria to others. Notify disease control agents  about any suspected infections that may be diphtheritic in origin.''There are ''vaccines'' available to protect individuals from diphtheria, and all formulations contain toxoid concentrations that stimulate antibody production against diphtheria toxin (D or d). These toxoid ''vaccinations'' also may contain acellular ''pertussis'' (aP or ap) and ''tetanus'' (T, ''tetanus'' toxoid) vaccine. They are as follows: DTaP, Tdap, DT, and Td. DTaP is the childhood vaccine, while Tdap is the adult vaccine. Perhaps the most important vaccine is DTaP, given at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15-18 months, and 4-6 years of age.''DT does not contain ''pertussis'', and health care providers administer it to children who have reacted to pertussis vaccine; Td is a vaccine for adolescents and adults given every 10 years as a booster for tetanus. Tdap has several formulations; the CDC in 2012 recommended that Tdap vaccine formulations be used as a booster dose to cover pertussis (''whooping cough'') instead of just the Td formulation against tetanus and diphtheria only.''The side effects of these ''vaccines'' are usually mild such as ''pain'' or soreness at the injection site and/or a mild fever. These effects usually go away within a day. However, some patients do develop more severe symptoms; although this is infrequent, patients that do so should be aware of the reaction and inform any medical ''caregiver'' that they may have an ''allergy'' (for example, an ''allergy'' to tetanus or pertussis vaccine).' "
Facts you should know about direct vs. indirect hernias,"   Approximately 800,000 hernia surgeries are performed every year in the U.S. Inguinal hernias are diagnosed by physical examination. Surgery (laparoscopic or open technique) is the standard treatment for a hernia. Hernia compilations can range from minor pain to a need for emergency surgery."
What are inguinal hernias?,"'Inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernias. They occur when tissues protrude through a spot in the abdominal muscles. Frequently, this tissue will be part of the intestine.''Inguinal hernias are not dangerous itself but can lead to significant complications especially if the intestinal tissue loses its blood supply. Usually, the hernia can be pushed back in or even slides back when the patient lays down. If the hernia cannot be pushed back in, it is considered incarcerated (the contents of the hernia are trapped). This will usually lead to severe ''pain'', as well as ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. If the blood supply is cut off, the hernia is considered strangulated. A strangulated hernia is life-threatening and requires immediate surgery.''Inguinal hernias are divided into direct and indirect hernias.' "
What is a direct hernia?,"'These inguinal hernias are usually caused by ''weakness'' in the muscle of the abdominal wall. The ''weakness'' can be due to an acute event (heavy lifting) or slowly develop over time.''Most commonly, this hernia is found in adult males.' "
What is an indirect hernia?,'An indirect hernia is caused by a birth defect in the abdominal wall.' 
What are causes and risk factors of direct and indirect hernias?,"'The hernias usually appear after increased abdominal pressure, such as straining or lifting a heavy object. Often they are linked to a weak spot in the abdominal wall that can be present since birth or secondary to abdominal surgery, injuries, or develop over time.''In men, the weakness usually is found in the inguinal canal that leads down into the scrotum.''Risk factors for inguinal hernias are older age, ''obesity'', being male, and having a family history of a hernia. ''Chronic cough'' and ''pregnancy'' are also risk factors.' "
What are signs and symptoms of direct and indirect hernias?,"'A bulge is usually visible in your inguinal area (groin). This bulge might become more obvious on standing or when lifting or ''coughing'' (straining). There might be ''pain'' or discomfort in the groin. If the hernia pushed into your scrotum, ''pain'' and swelling around the testicle will be present.''In newborns, the hernia might be visible when the child cries or ''coughs''.' "
"How do health care professionals diagnose hernias, and what is the treatment for direct and indirect 
hernias?","'Your doctor can usually diagnose an ''inguinal hernia'' by physical examination alone. A bulge will be apparent in your groin while standing. ''Coughing'' will help show the bulge.''Should the hernia not be readily visible, your doctor might order a ''CT scan'' or ''MRI''.''If the hernia is not painful and not too large, you can choose to watch it without any specific therapy. Depending on your lifestyle and the discomfort level, you might choose surgery to fix the hernia.''An enlarging hernia, or significant pain, will usually require surgery to alleviate the symptoms.''Any hernia that cannot be reduced (pushed back in) will require surgery.''Hernia repair can take place in two different ways: open hernia repair and laparoscopic repair.''The open procedure requires an incision, pushing the hernia back in, and then repairing the weak area.''During the laparoscopic procedure, the surgeon will repair the hernia via several small incisions and guidance by a small camera inserted through one of the incisions.' "
What is the prognosis for direct and indirect hernias?,'The repairs of inguinal hernias are usually successful with minimal complications and reoccurrences.' 
Is it possible to prevent direct and indirect hernias?,"'In many cases, it is impossible to prevent inguinal hernias as the weakness in the abdominal wall is present since birth. Avoiding straining, heavy lifting, and treating chronic ''cough'' can be helpful preventive measures.' "
What are learning disabilities?,"'Learning disability'' is a general term that describes specific kinds of learning problems. A learning disability can cause a person to have trouble learning and using certain skills. The skills most often affected are: ''Learning disabilities (LD) vary from person to person. One person with learning disabilities may not have the same kind of learning problems as another person with learning disabilities. One person may have trouble with reading and writing. Another person with learning disabilities may have problems with understanding math. Still another person may have trouble in each of these areas, as well as with understanding what people are saying.''Researchers think that learning disabilities are caused by differences in how a person\'s brain works and how it processes information. Children with learning disabilities are not ""dumb"" or ""lazy."" In fact, they usually have average or above average intelligence. Their brains just process information differently.''The definition of ""learning disability"" just below comes from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The IDEA is the federal law that guides how schools provide special education and related services to children with disabilities. ''There is no ""cure"" for learning disabilities. They are life-long. However, children with learning disabilities can be high achievers and can be taught ways to get around the learning disability. With the right help, children with learning disabilities can and do learn successfully. ''IDEA\'s Definition of ""Learning Disability"" '""Our nation's special education law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, defines a specific learning disability as . . . ""'"". . . a disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, that may manifest itself in an imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or do mathematical calculations, including conditions such as perceptual disabilities, ''brain injury'', minimal brain dysfunction, ''dyslexia'', and developmental ''aphasia''."" ''However, learning disabilities do not include, ""...learning problems that are primarily the result of visual, ''hearing'', or motor disabilities, of mental retardation, of emotional disturbance, or of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage."" ''34 Code of Federal Regulations §300.7(c)(10)'   reading, writing,  listening,  speaking,  reasoning, and  doing math. "
How common are learning disabilities?,"'Very common! As many as 1 out of every 5 people in the United States has a learning disability. Almost 3 million children (ages 6 through 21) have some form of a learning disability and receive special education in school. In fact, over half of all children who receive special education have a learning disability (T''wenty-fourth Annual Report to Congress'', U.S. Department of Education, 2002).' "
What are the signs of a learning disability?,"""There is no one sign that shows a person has a learning disability. Experts look for a noticeable difference between how well a child does in school and how well he or she could do, given his or her intelligence or ability. There are also certain clues that may mean a child has a learning disability. We've listed a few below. Most relate to elementary school tasks, because learning disabilities tend to be identified in elementary school. A child probably won't show all of these signs, or even most of them. However, if a child shows a number of these problems, then parents and the teacher should consider the possibility that the child has a learning disability. ""'When a child has a learning disability, he or she: ''If a child has unexpected problems learning to read, write, listen, speak, or do math, then teachers and parents may want to investigate more. The same is true if the child is struggling to do any one of these skills. The child may need to be evaluated to see if he or she has a learning disability. '   may have trouble learning the alphabet, rhyming words, or connecting letters to their sounds;  may make many mistakes when reading aloud, and repeat and pause often;  may not understand what he or she reads;  may have real trouble with spelling;  may have very messy handwriting or hold a pencil awkwardly;  may struggle to express ideas in writing;  may learn language late and have a limited vocabulary;  may have trouble remembering the sounds that letters make or hearing slight differences between words;  may have trouble understanding jokes, comic strips, and sarcasm;  may have trouble following directions;  may mispronounce words or use a wrong word that sounds similar;  may have trouble organizing what he or she wants to say or not be able to think of the word he or she needs for writing or conversation;  may not follow the social rules of conversation, such as taking turns, and may stand too close to the listener;  may confuse math symbols and misread numbers;  may not be able to retell a story in order (what happened first, second, third); or  may not know where to begin a task or how to go on from there. "
What about school and learning disabilities?,"'Learning disabilities tend to be diagnosed when children reach school age. This is because school focuses on the very things that may be difficult for the child - reading, writing, math, listening, speaking, and reasoning. Teachers and parents notice that the child is not learning as expected. The school may ask to evaluate the child to see what is causing the problem. Parents can also ask for their child to be evaluated. '""With hard work and the proper help, children with learning disabilities can learn more easily and successfully. For school-aged children (including preschoolers), special education and related services are important sources of help. School staff work with the child's parents to develop an ""'Individualized Education Program'"", or IEP. This document describes the child's unique needs. It also describes the special education services that will be provided to meet those needs. These services are provided at no cost to the child or family. ""'Supports or changes in the classroom (sometimes called accommodations) help most students with learning disabilities. Some common accommodations are listed below in ""Tips for Teachers"". Assistive technology can also help many students work around their learning disabilities. Assistive technology can range from ""low-tech"" equipment such as tape recorders to ""high-tech"" tools such as reading machines (which read books aloud) and voice recognition systems (which allow the student to ""write"" by talking to the computer).

Tips for parents of children with learning disabilities,"'Learn about learning disabilities. The more you know, the more you can help yourself and your child. See the list of resources and organizations at the end of this article. ' Praise your child when he or she does well. Children with learning disabilities are often very good at a variety of things. Find out what your child really enjoys doing, such as dancing, playing soccer, or working with computers. Give your child plenty of opportunities to pursue his or her strengths and talents.  Find out the ways your child learns best. Does he or she learn by hands-on practice, looking, or listening? Help your child learn through his or her areas of strength.  Let your child help with household chores. These can build self-confidence and concrete skills. Keep instructions simple, break down tasks into smaller steps, and reward your child's efforts with praise.  Make homework a priority. Read more about how to help your child be a success at homework. (See resource list at the end.)  Pay attention to your child's mental health (and your own!). Be open to counseling, which can help your child deal with frustration, feel better about himself or herself, and learn more about social skills.  Talk to other parents whose children have learning disabilities. Parents can share practical advice and emotional support. Call NICHCY (1.800.695.0285) and ask how to find parent groups near you. Also let us put you in touch with the parent training and information (PTI) center in your state.  Meet with school personnel and help develop an educational plan to address your child's needs. Plan what accommodations your child needs, and don't forget to talk about assistive technology!  Establish a positive working relationship with your child's teacher. Through regular communication, exchange information about your child's progress at home and at school. "
Tips for teachers of children with learning disabilities,"'Learn as much as you can about the different types of learning disabilities. The resources and organizations at the end of this document can help you identify specific techniques and strategies to support the student educationally. '""Seize the opportunity to make an enormous difference in this student's life! Find out and emphasize what the student's strengths and interests are. Give the student positive feedback and lots of opportunities for practice. """"Review the student's evaluation records to identify where specifically the student has trouble. Talk to specialists in your school (e.g., special education teacher) about methods for teaching this student. Provide instruction and accommodations to address the student's special needs. Examples include: ""'Learn about the different testing modifications that can really help a student with learning disabilities show what he or she has learned. ''Teach organizational skills, study skills, and learning strategies. These help all students but are particularly helpful to those with learning disabilities.

Is there any treatment for learning disabilities?,"""The most common treatment for learning disabilities is special education. Specially trained educators may perform a diagnostic educational evaluation assessing the child's academic and intellectual potential and level of academic performance. Once the evaluation is complete, the basic approach is to teach learning skills by building on the child's abilities and strengths while correcting and compensating for disabilities and weaknesses. Other professionals such as speech and language therapists also may be involved. Some medications may be effective in helping the child learn by enhancing attention and concentration. Psychological therapies may also be used. "" "
What is the prognosis for learning disabilities? ,"'Learning disabilities can be lifelong conditions. In some people, several overlapping learning disabilities may be apparent. Other people may have a single, isolated learning problem that has little impact on their lives. ' "
What research is being done for learning disabilities? ,"'The NINDS and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health including the National Institute of ''Child Health'' and Human Development, the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, and the National Institute of Mental Health support research on learning disabilities. Current research avenues focus on developing techniques to diagnose and treat learning disabilities and increase understanding of the biological basis of learning disabilities. ' "

Who are not good candidates for dental implants?,'The benefits of dental implants may not be universal to everyone. A decision may be taken by the dentist and the patient. Patients with below conditions may not be a good candidate for dental implants.' Patients with uncontrolled diabetes Patients with cancer or patients on cancer treatment Alcohol habituated patients Patients with preexisting gum disease Patients who smoke regularly
What are dental implants?,"'Dental implantation involves the placement of a metal post into the jawbone to act as an artificial root. It is a surgery that typically involves removing ''teeth'', cutting gums, drilling into the jawbone, and inserting a titanium post.''Titanium, the metal used to make implants, is proved to be highly compatible with the ''human body''. Below are two main types of implants:''The three phases of dental implants include:' Endosteal: These dental implants are placed in the jawbone. Typically made of titanium and shaped like small screws, they are the most commonly used type of implant. Subperiosteal: These dental implants are placed under the gum but on, or above, the jawbone. This type of implant may be used in patients who do not have enough healthy natural jawbones and cannot, or do not want to, undergo a bone augmentation procedure to rebuild it. Placing the implant: The patient may undergo surgery to have the implant placed in the jaw, where it is covered with gum tissue and allowed to integrate into the jawbone for three to six months. Attaching the post: The dentist attaches a post to the implant and the gum tissue can grow up around it. In some cases, the implant and post are placed simultaneously. Whether they are placed at the same time, the combination implant and post serve as an anchor for the replacement tooth. Crown attachment: Dentist attaches a customized crown to the implant post."
What are the advantages of dental implants?,"'The advantages of dental implants include:' They help prevent jawbone degradation that comes with tooth loss. They are a great way to improve the smile and overall dental health. Dental implants provide a more natural tooth replacement than dentures. They give the patient a set of strong teeth, allowing patients to enjoy favorite foods without any irritations. Dental implants rarely fail and have an average success rate of 95 to 98%."
What should a patient do after dental implants?,"'Below are a few common ways to maximize the healing process after the dental implant:' Strictly follow the postoperative instructions recommended by the dentist. Instructions may include taking pain medications like Advil or Tylenol as directed and taking prophylactic antibiotics if prescribed Regular gentle rinsing with a warm saltwater solution may kill germs and promote healing Avoiding hot, spicy, or crunchy foods for the first 10 days may avoid infection Maintaining good oral hygiene is always recommended Brushing gently near the implant sites may avoid any infection due to injury Using cold compresses as directed will help in controlling the pain"
What is the anatomy of the disc of the spine (intervertebral disc)?,'The disc is an important structure that rests between the bony building blocks of the spine (vertebrae). The disc in the spine is sometimes referred to as the intervertebral disc. Intervertebral discs help provide flexibility to our spine. They also lessen the effect of impact on our spine by cushioning the bony vertebrae. The disc is designed somewhat like a jelly donut. The disc has a stronger outer layer (the annulus) that is rather like a radial tire and an inner gel (the nucleus) that acts as a sort of ''shock'' absorber or cushion between the bones of the spine.' 
What happens to the disc with injury or age?,"'With injury or age, these discs can become damaged and the supporting ligaments surrounding them weaken. One of the reasons we lose height as we age is that the intervertebral discs lose their water content. This leads to shrinkage of the disc and, as a result, height diminishes.' "
What is a discogram used for?,"'An injured disc can be a source of ''pain''. A discogram is an X-ray procedure used to determine if a particular disc is the source of ''pain'"". Discograms are provocative tests, meaning that they attempt to reproduce a pain rather than remove a pain. The reproduction of pain during a discogram can help the doctor determine if injury to a particular disc is the source of a person's pain.""  "
How do health-care professionals perform a discogram?,"'During a discogram, a needle is inserted into the disc and a contrast dye is injected. This extra fluid in the disc increases the pressure in the disc. Patients with an injured disc may then experience pain that can mimic the pain they have been experiencing. The intensity of the pain is recorded on a 0-10 scale.' "
How do physicians interpret the results of a discogram?,"'Based upon the information provided by the discogram, the pain elicited can be correlated with the disc imaged in the test. Thus, the diagnosis of a particular disc injury can be made. The doctor can then determine what the optimal treatment options are for relief of the underlying pain.''An actual discogram as visualized using an X-ray viewing instrument called a fluoroscope.' "
How long is the recovery time after a discogram?,'Patients may be sore for several days after the procedure. Any discomfort can be treated with the local application of ice packs or with a cooling pad on and off for periods of 20 minutes.' 
What are potential side effects and complications of a discogram? Is pain associated with the procedure?,"'Because it is an invasive procedure, a discogram carries some risk of infection as a complication. This risk is exceptionally low as it is performed under sterile techniques. The discogram could also cause an injured disc to worsen and cause more symptoms.'  "
Maintaining health,"'The body requires carbohydrates, ''fats'', proteins, ''vitamins'', and ''minerals'' to maintain healthy organs, bones, muscles, and nerves, and to produce hormones and chemicals that are necessary for the proper function of organs.''Vitamins'' and minerals are naturally occurring substances that are essential for the growth and function of the body. Vitamins and minerals are both necessary (in small amounts) for normal chemical reactions (metabolism) in the body.' "
Preventing and controlling diseases,"'Obesity and ''heart attacks'' are major public-health problems in the United States and other countries. Therefore, most dietary recommendations are aimed at preventing these two diseases. Obesity comes over time by eating more calories than the body ''burns''. Obesity, in turn, can contribute to the development of many diseases such as ''heart disease'', ''diabetes'',  ''sleep apnea'', ''liver disease'', ''arthritis'', ''high blood pressure'', ''gout'', ''gallstones'', and certain cancers.''To ''lose weight'' or maintain a healthy weight, it helps to eat more low-energy-dense foods. Low-energy-dense foods (such as vegetables and fruits) contain few calories per unit volume of food so that one can eat a large volume of it (for example, lettuce) without taking in many calories. One should also eat less of the high-energy-dense foods such as fats, egg yolks, fried foods, sweets, and high-fat salad dressings. Foods with a high energy density also often have ''high cholesterol'' and saturated fat content. One should also eat less of those foods that provide calories but little other nutrients, such as ''alcohol'' and many packaged snack foods.''The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, published in 2010 by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), contains guidelines for healthy diets based upon review of scientific studies for people above 2 years of age. These guidelines recommend that a healthy ''diet'' should:''MyPyramid'"" is an online animated program to help a person customize his/her diet by choosing proper foods and portion sizes based on the individual's age, sex, and activity level. The key objectives of the MyPyramid Plan are to help a person get the most ""'nutrition'' (proteins, vitamins, and minerals) out of the recommended number of daily calories and to achieve a balance between food intake and physical activity to maintain a healthy weight. The MyPyramid Plan recommendations include:' balance calories with physical activity to manage weight; consume more of certain foods and nutrients such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat-free and low-fat dairy products, and seafood; consume fewer foods with sodium (salt), saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, added sugars, and refined grains. Make half your grains whole. Vary your veggies. Focus on fruit. Get your calcium-rich foods. Go lean with protein. Find your balance between food and physical activity."
Vitamins and minerals to maintain health,"'Vitamins and mineral ''supplements'' are important both in preventing deficiency states as well as in preventing diseases. Most diseases resulting from vitamin deficiencies such as ''scurvy'' (''vitamin C'' deficiency), night\xa0''blindness'' (''vitamin A'' deficiency), and beriberi (''thiamine'' deficiency) occur mainly in third-world countries and are almost nonexistent in the United States. But certain special populations in the United States can develop vitamin or mineral deficiencies, and thus require ''dietary supplements''. For example,''For these special populations, vitamin ''supplements'' are important to prevent these deficiencies.'   severely malnourished alcoholics can develop nerve damage from thiamine deficiency;  individuals lacking sun exposure can develop bone disease from vitamin D deficiency; pernicious anemia is a condition associated with nerve damage, which can result from vitamin B12 deficiency; and people with celiac sprue can also develop vitamin deficiencies, as well as iron deficiency."
Vitamin supplements to prevent diseases,"'Vitamin supplements are used to prevent deficiencies and also to prevent diseases. Certain vitamin supplements (such as ''folic acid'', vitamin B6, and B12) have been used to lower blood levels of ''homocysteine'', which may help prevent ''heart attacks''. Folic acid fortification in cereals and vitamin supplements has been found to decrease the risk of ''birth defects'' in the developing fetus in ''pregnant'' women.' "
Diets to control and/or treat diseases,"'Diets low in simple sugars are important in controlling blood glucose levels in people with ''diabetes'' mellitus. When the condition cannot be adequately controlled by diet alone, medications (sometimes including ''insulin'') are required.'   The DASH diet is recommended to lower blood pressure. If dietary measures alone are not sufficient, medications are frequently prescribed by doctors (sometimes in combination) to lower blood pressure. A gluten-free diet is the primary treatment for celiac disease (celiac sprue). Since people with celiac sprue may have difficulty absorbing nutrients and vitamins, some people with this condition may also need calcium, iron, and vitamin supplements. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) are important treatments for high blood levels of cholesterol, especially the ""bad"" ( LDL) cholesterol. When TLC are not sufficient, then medications are usually indicated to lower blood lipid levels."
What is healthy living?,"""This article is designed to give tips to readers about how they can improve or augment actions in their life to have a healthy lifestyle; it is not meant to be all inclusive but will include major components that are considered to be parts of a lifestyle that lead to good health. In addition to the tips about what people should do for healthy living, the article will mention some of the tips about avoiding actions (the don'ts) that lead to unhealthy living.""'""Healthy living"" to most people means both physical and ''mental health'' are in balance or functioning well together in a person. In many instances, physical and mental health are closely linked, so that a change (good or bad) in one directly affects the other. Consequently, some of the tips will include suggestions for emotional and mental ""healthy living.""' "
Healthy eating (diet and nutrition),"'All humans have to eat food for growth and maintenance of a healthy body, but we humans have different ''nutrition'' requirements as infants, children (kids), teenagers, young adults, adults, and seniors. For example, infants may require feeding every 4 hours until they gradually age and begin to take in more solid foods. Eventually they develop into the more normal pattern of eating three times per day as young kids. However, as most parents know, kids, teenagers, and young adults often snack between meals. Snacking is often not limited to these age groups because adults and seniors often do the same.''Tips:''Tips for special situations:'   Eat three healthy meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner); it is important to remember that dinner does not have to be the largest meal. The bulk of food consumption should consist of healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk products. Incorporate lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts (with emphasis on beans and nuts) into a healthy diet. Choose foods that are low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt (sodium), and added sugars; look at the labels because the first listed items on the labels comprise the highest concentrations of ingredients. Control portion sizes; eat the smallest portion that can satisfy hunger and then stop eating. Healthy snacks are OK in moderation and should consist of items like fruit, whole grains, or nuts to satisfy hunger and not cause excessive weight gain. Avoid sodas and sugar-enhanced drinks because of the excessive calories in the sodas and sugar drinks; diet drinks may not be a good choice as they make some people hungrier and increase food consumption. Avoid eating a large meal before sleeping to decrease gastroesophageal reflux and weight gain. If a person is angry or depressed, eating will not solve these situations and may make the underlying problems worse. Avoid rewarding children with sugary snacks; such a pattern may become a lifelong habit for people. Avoid heavy meals in the summer months, especially during hot days. A vegetarian lifestyle has been promoted for a healthy lifestyle and weight loss; vegetarians should check with their physicians to be sure they are getting enough vitamins, minerals, and iron in their diet. Cooking foods (above 165 F) destroys most harmful bacteria and other pathogens; if you choose to eat uncooked foods like fruits or vegetables, they should be thoroughly washed with running treated (safe to drink) tap water right before eating. Avoid eating raw or undercooked meats of any type. People with diabetes should use the above tips and monitor their glucose levels as directed; try to keep the daily blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. People with unusual work schedules (night shifts, college students, military) should try to adhere to a breakfast, lunch, and dinner routine with minimal snacking. People who prepare food should avoid using grease or frying foods in grease. People trying to lose weight (body fat) should avoid all fatty and sugary foods and eat mainly vegetables, fruits, and nuts and markedly reduce his/her intake of meat and dairy products. Seek medical advice early if you cannot control your weight, food intake, or if you have diabetes and cannot control your blood glucose levels."
Physical activity and exercise,"'Physical activity and ''exercise'' is a major contributor to a healthy lifestyle; people are made to use their bodies, and disuse leads to unhealthy living. Unhealthy living may manifest itself in ''obesity'', ''weakness'', lack of endurance, and overall poor health that may foster disease development.''Tips:''Most individuals can begin moderate exercise, such as walking, without a medical examination. The following people, however, should consult a doctor before beginning more vigorous exercise:''Consequences of physical inactivity and lack of exercise:''Healthy living involves more than physical health, it also includes emotional or mental health. The following are some ways people can support their mental health and well-being.''Tips:''Avoidance behavior is another key to wellness. Below are described some of the major items to avoid if a person is seeking a healthy lifestyle.'  Regular exercise can prevent and reverse age-related decreases in muscle mass and strength, improve balance, flexibility, and endurance, and decrease the risk of falls in the elderly. Regular exercise can help prevent coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure. Regular, weight-bearing exercise can also help prevent osteoporosis by building bone strength. Regular fitness can help chronic arthritis sufferers improve their capacity to perform daily activities such as driving, climbing stairs, and opening jars. Regular exercise can help increase self-esteem and self-confidence, decrease stress and anxiety, enhance mood, and improve general mental health. Regular exercise can help control body weight and in some people cause loss of fat. Thirty minutes of modest exercise (walking is OK) at least 3 to 5 days a week is recommended, but the greatest health benefits come from exercising most days of the week. Exercise can be broken up into smaller 10-minute sessions. Start slowly and progress gradually to avoid injury or excessive soreness or fatigue. Over time, build up to 30 to 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day. People are never too old to start exercising. Even frail, elderly individuals (70-90 years of age) can improve their strength and balance with exercise. Almost any type of exercise (resistance, water aerobics, walking, swimming, weights, yoga, and many others) is helpful for everybody. Children need exercise; play outside of the home is a good beginning. Sports for children may provide excellent opportunities for exercise, but care must be taken not to overdo certain exercises (for example, throwing too many pitches in baseball may harm a joint like the elbow or shoulder). Exertion during strenuous exercise may make a person tired and sore, but if pain occurs, stop the exercise until the pain source is discovered; the person may need to seek medical help and advice about continuation of such exercise. Men over age 40 or women over age 50 Individuals with heart or lung disease, asthma, arthritis, or osteoporosis Individuals who experience chest pressure or pain with exertion, or who develop fatigue or shortness of breath easily Individuals with conditions that increase their risks of developing coronary heart disease, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cigarette smoking, high blood cholesterol, or having family members who had early onset heart attacks and coronary heart disease Individuals who are morbidly obese Physical inactivity and lack of exercise are associated with heart disease and some cancers. Physical inactivity and lack of exercise are associated with type II diabetes mellitus (also known as maturity or adult-onset, non-insulin-dependent diabetes). Physical inactivity and lack of exercise contribute to weight gain. Get enough sleep daily; the CDC recommends the following by age group (naps inclusive); 12-18 hours from birth to 2 months, 14-15 hours from 3-11 months of age, 12-18 hours for 1-3 years of age, 11-13 hours for 3-5 years of age, 10-11 hours for 5-10 years of age, 8.5-9.5 hours for 10-17 years of age and those 18 and above need 7-9 hours of sleep. Elderly people need about 7-9 hours but do not sleep as deeply and may awaken at night or wake early, so naps (like kids need) allow them to accumulate the total of 7-9 hours of sleep. Take a walk and reflect on what you see and hear at least several times per week. Try something new and often (eat a new food, try a different route to work, go to a new museum display). Do some mind exercises (read, do a puzzle occasionally during the week). Try to focus on a process intensely and complete a segment of it over 1 to several hours, then take a break and do something relaxing (walk, exercise, short nap). Plan to spend some time talking with other people about different subjects. Try to make some leisure time to do some things that interest you every week (hobby, sport). Learn ways to say ""no"" when something occurs that you do not want to do or be involved with. Have fun (go on a trip with someone you love, go shopping, go fishing; do not let vacation time slip away). Let yourself be pleased with your achievements, both big and small (develop contentment). Have a network of friends; those with strong social support systems lead healthier lives. Seek help and advice early if you feel depressed, have suicidal thoughts, or consider harming yourself or others. People taking medicine for mental health problems should not stop taking these medications, no matter how ""well"" they feel, until they have discussed their situation with their prescribing doctor(s)."
Avoid tobacco use,"'Tobacco use is the most important preventable illness and cause of death in the U.S., according to the National ''Cancer'' Institute (NCI). Tobacco use was estimated to be the cause of 443,000 deaths in 2010 in the U.S.''Tip:' Stop smoking tobacco; start to stop today (it takes about 15 years of nonsmoking behavior to achieve a ""normal"" risk level for heart disease for those that smoke). Stop using chewing tobacco to avoid oral cancers. Tobacco use causes or contributes to a large number of cancers in the U.S. In men, 90% of lung cancer deaths are attributable to smoking; 80% in women. Tobacco use causes cancers of the lung, mouth, lip, tongue, esophagus, kidney, and bladder. It also further increases the risk of bladder cancer in subjects occupationally exposed to certain organic chemicals found in the textile, leather, rubber, dye, paint, and other organic chemical industries, and further increases the risk of lung cancer among subjects exposed to asbestos. Tobacco use causes atherosclerotic arterial disease (hardening and narrowing of the arteries) that can lead to heart attacks, strokes, and lack of blood flow to the lower extremities. Tobacco use causes an estimated 20%-30% of coronary heart disease in the U.S. It also further increases the risk of heart attacks among subjects with elevated cholesterol, uncontrolled hypertension, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle. Tobacco use causes an estimated 20% of chronic lung diseases in the U.S., such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and causes pneumonia in those with chronic lung disease. The CDC, in 2011, estimated that 90% of deaths from chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) were due to smoking. Pregnant women who smoke are more likely to deliver babies with low birth weight. Secondhand smoke can cause middle-ear infections (otitis media), coughing, wheezing, bronchitis, and pneumonia in babies, and aggravate asthma in children. Secondhand smoke (sometimes referred to as passive smoking) can also cause lung cancer. Quitting smoking is difficult to accomplish; tobacco contains nicotine, which is addictive. Some smokers can quit ""cold turkey,"" but for most, quitting smoking requires a serious life-long commitment and an average of six quitting attempts before success. Quitting smoking efforts may include behavior modification, counseling, use of nicotine chewing gum (Nicorette Gum), nicotine skin patches (Transderm Nicotine), or oral medications such as bupropion (Zyban)."
Avoid excessive alcohol consumption,"'There are many treatments for ''alcoholism''. But the crucial first step to recovery is for the individual to admit there is a problem and make a commitment to address the alcoholism issue. The 12-step-style self-help programs, pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous, can be one effective treatment. Psychologists and related professionals have developed programs to help individuals better handle emotional stresses and avoid behaviors that can lead to excess drinking. Support and understanding from family members are often critical for sustained recovery. Medication can be useful for the ''prevention'' of relapses and for withdrawal symptoms following acute or prolonged intoxication.'   Chronic, excess alcohol consumption is the major cause of liver cirrhosis in the U.S. Liver cirrhosis can cause internal hemorrhage, fluid accumulation in the abdomen, easy bleeding and bruising, muscle wasting, mental confusion, infections, and in advanced cases, coma, and kidney failure. Liver cirrhosis can lead to liver cancer. Alcohol accounts for 40%-50% of deaths from automobile accidents in the U.S. Alcohol use is a significant cause of injury and death from home accidents, drowning, and burns."
Avoid high-risk sexual behaviors,"'High-risk sexual behavior can lead to the acquisition of sexually transmitted illnesses such as ''gonorrhea'', ''syphilis'', ''herpes'', or ''HIV'' infection. High-risk sexual behavior is also known to spread ''human papillomavirus'' infection, which can lead to ''cervical cancer'' in women and other anogenital cancers in both men and women. High-risk sexual behaviors include the following:' Multiple sex partners Sex partners with a history of the following:Intravenous drug useVenereal disease (sexually transmitted diseases or STDs) Intravenous drug use Venereal disease (sexually transmitted diseases or STDs) Transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, genital herpes) Transmission of hepatitis B (50% of hepatitis B infections are due to sexual transmission) and, in rare instances, hepatitis C Transmission of human papilloma virus (HPV), which can cause genital warts and anogenital carcinomas, most commonly cancer of the uterine cervix Unplanned pregnancy Avoid unprotected sex (sex without barriers such as a condom) outside an established, committed, monogamous relationship. If you plan to have sex and are unsure of your partner's health status, use a condom."
Avoid other high-risk behaviors,"'Sunscreens have undergone changes, and the U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) published new requirements that sunscreens needed to meet starting in 2012. Currently, the FDA suggests an effective sunscreen is rated as ''SPF'' 30 or higher and has both UVA and UVB protection (protection against ultraviolet waves of types A and B). In most instances, sunscreen needs to be applied every 2 hours and each time after a person has gone swimming.'  Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs Driving while sleep-deprived Reckless driving and speeding, ""road rage"" Driving while using cell phones, texting, or performing other tasks Motorcycle (and bicycle) riding without helmets Possession of firearms and guns without proper training and storage Smoking in bed Motor vehicle accidents account for 40%-50% of accidental deaths. Motorcycle accidents are a major cause of serious head injuries. Firearms and guns account for a significant proportion of deaths among adolescents due to male suicide and homicide. Smoking in bed can lead to burn injury and death. When driving, use seat restraints on all passengers, both front and rear seats. Do not drink and drive. Do not drive if sleep deprived. Avoid unnecessary distractions and focus on the road and traffic while driving (avoid texting, talking on cell phones, eating, applying makeup, or other distractions). Use helmets while riding bicycles and motorcycles. Helmet use reduces deaths from motorcycle accidents by 30% and serious head injuries by 75%. Obtain proper training in the use and storage of guns and ammunition. Use smoke detectors; avoid smoking in bed. Melanoma and other skin cancers Avoid sunburns and sun exposure by using adequate skin protection; use brimmed hats, protective clothing, and sunscreen."
Additional tips for healthy living,"'Although there are many other risky behaviors that may impede an otherwise healthy lifestyle (for example, working with toxic or radioactive materials, ''drug addiction'', travel to areas with unusual endemic diseases), these are too numerous to cover in this general article. However, the reader is advised to visit such topic sites on MedicineNet.com, eMedicineHealth.com or WebMD.com because most of the specific articles will provide tips to avoid health-related problems.'

Disease prevention in men introduction,"'Routine screening tests are part of basic ''prevention'' medicine. All of the following screening tests are commonly available through your doctor. Take an active role in your own health care and discuss screening tests with your doctor early in life. Following is a list of diseases for which screening is recommended along with mention of the commonly used screening tests, which usually are safe and simple and can help detect many diseases before they become harmful.'

High blood pressure (hypertension),"'About one-sixth of all Americans have ''high blood pressure'' and the incidence of this disease increases with age. African-Americans are more likely than other races to have ''high blood pressure''.''High blood pressure'' can cause arterial disease (''atherosclerosis'') that can lead to ''heart attack'', ''congestive heart failure'', ''stroke'', and ''kidney failure''.' High blood pressure: systolic >140, and/or diastolic >90  Borderline high blood pressure: systolic 130-140, and/or diastolic 85-90 How often blood pressure should be checked depends on how severely elevated the blood pressure is, and also depends on the number of other heart attack and stroke risk factors that are present. Adults with most recent normal blood pressure of systolic <130 and diastolic <85 should be checked at least every other year. Adults with borderline high blood pressures (systolic 130-140 or diastolic 85-90) should be rechecked in 3-6 months. High blood pressure can cause arterial disease (atherosclerosis) that can lead to heart attack, congestive heart failure, stroke, and kidney failure. High blood pressure can cause diseases without any early warning symptoms. There is good evidence that treatment of high blood pressure can reduce the risk of heart diseases, stroke, and kidney failure. There is good evidence that adults with borderline blood pressures can benefit from blood pressure lowering. Therefore, you should discuss with your doctor measures that you can take to reduce blood pressure, which can include reducing salt intake, exercise, and stress management."

An estimated 18% of all Americans over 65 years of age have ''diabetes''. Over ten million Americans have been diagnosed with ''diabetes'', and at least half as many more are thought to have diabetes that is undiagnosed. Many more have a condition that precedes diabetes, referred to as ''prediabetes'', characterized by elevated blood ''sugar'' levels but to a lesser degree than is present in those with diabetes.''Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of ''blindness'' in adults aged 20-74 years, the leading cause of chronic kidney failure, and the leading cause of lower extremity amputations not related to injury.

Diabetes mellitus also can damage the nerves, eyes, and kidneys.  Diabetes mellitus commonly causes organ damage without symptoms until extensive damage is present.  There is good evidence that controlling hyperglycemia in diabetes with medications, diet, weight control, and regular exercise can slow the development of atherosclerosis and heart, eye, nerve, and kidney damage.  There is good evidence that curtailing total calorie intake (especially intake of processed starches, sugar and sweets), regular exercise, and losing excess weight can help prevent the development of type II diabetes mellitus, especially in adults at higher than normal risk of developing diabetes."

HIV testing can be performed by a physician or at a testing center. pregnant women; individuals with occupational exposure to HIV (health care workers and researchers working with HIV infected individuals or tissues or blood products containing the HIV virus); individuals with high-risk sexual behavior (multiple sexual partners, unprotected intercourse), or who practice needle-sharing; anyone requesting HIV testing; individuals with active tuberculosis, unexplained fevers, low white blood cell counts, or who have been diagnosed with a sexually-transmitted infection; and routine Screening is gaining more and more support as HIV is becoming a treatable disease. Theoretically, early treatment with anti-HIV medications may help the body's immune system fight the virus. So far, early treatment cannot cure or eradicate the virus. Therefore, early detection is most important to prevent the spread of the virus. Early detection, if it leads to life style changes , can also decrease the spread of the disease. The virus is present in the blood, genital, and other body secretions of virtually all infected individuals, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms. The HIV virus is spread from one person to another when these secretions come in contact with the vagina, anal area, mouth, or eyes, or with a break in the skin, such as from a cut, bruise, sore, or puncture by a needle.

If these polyps are identified and removed before they turn cancerous, ''colon cancer'' can be prevented. Colon ''cancer'' is curable if it is surgically removed before the ''cancer'' spreads.''Stool occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy are documented to reduce colon cancer mortality by:' Stool occult blood test: A fecal occult blood test is a chemical test to detect trace amounts of blood in stool. It is inexpensive and easy, though not always accurate. Some cancers are not detected with this test, and many positive tests are due to conditions other than cancer.  Flexible sigmoidoscopy: A flexible sigmoidoscopy is a relatively quick and easy office procedure that allows direct visualization and biopsy of suspicious lesions from the distal (end) portion of the colon. The drawbacks include some discomfort and is not as thorough as colonoscopy.  Optical colonoscopy:Optical colonoscopy is the isualization of the entire colon. This is the most complete and thorough test, but often requires IV sedation, much more expensive, and is not covered by some insurance for screening.  Virtual colonoscopy:Virtual colonoscopy is a less invasive procedure utilizing CT scan to construct virtual images of the colon that are similar to the views of the colon obtained by direct colonoscopy. The drawbacks to virtual colonoscopy are that it cannot remove polyps, and is not as reliable as optical colonoscopy in detecting small polyps, finding flat cancers, or polyps that are not protruding. All healthy adults should have stool occult blood tests and flexible 
sigmoidoscopy at age 50 and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years.  Alternatively, instead of flexible sigmoidoscopy, all healthy persons can undergo screening colonoscopy at age 50 and then every 10 years if no prior history of polyps or cancer.

Prostate cancer,"'Prostate cancer'' is the most commonly occurring non-''skin cancer'' in men in the United States. Among the non-''skin cancers'', it is also the second most frequent cause of cancer death in this population.''Although screening tests (see below) are available, there is no scientific consensus on effective measures for reducing the incidence of prostate cancer. Additionally, there is no agreement on the effectiveness of screening or that the potential benefits of screening tests outweigh the risks.''The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of ''prostate cancer screening'' in men younger than age 75 years and that screening should not be carried out in men age 75 years or older.''The purpose of the screening is to detect early, tiny, or even microscopic cancers that are confined to the ''prostate gland''. Early treatment of these malignancies (cancers) can stop the growth, prevent the spread, and possibly cure the cancer. However, the evidence is not conclusive that screening and treatment of early and localized prostate cancer is beneficial; some elderly men may live with prostate cancer for many years and die from other conditions rather than from the prostate cancer, and the measures undertaken for diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer (surgery, ''radiation therapy'', ''chemotherapy'', or hormones) can have side effects and serious complications such as ''pain'' associated with the biopsy procedure, ''erectile dysfunction'', ''urinary incontinence'', bowel dysfunction, and death.

Others should have an eye exam at least once during this period.  Age 30-39: Individuals of African descent or with a family history of glaucoma should have an eye examination every two to four years. Others should have an eye exam at least twice during this period.  Age 40-64: Every two to four years.  Age 65 or older: Every one to two years.  Glaucoma causes extensive damage to the retina and irreversible loss of vision without waning symptoms and before the individual becomes aware of loss of vision.

Urine examination for blood cells. This may be done by dipstick tests with confirmation by microscopic examination of the urine, or by initial microscopic examination.  Bladder cancer can cause either gross hematuria (visible blood in the urine) or microscopic hematuria (blood in the urine only visible with a microscope). It is important to note that bladder cancer is only one of many causes of blood in the urine.  Early bladder cancer may produce no symptoms and no visible bleeding in the urine, and blood in the urine commonly microscopic.  Treatment can be effective if the cancer is detected early, and survival is strongly associated with stage of disease at time of treatment.  Cessation of cigarette smoking is always advisable."

Breast cancer,"'Breast cancer'' is the most common ''cancer'' among women in the United States. Approximately one in nine women who live to age 65 will develop ''breast cancer'', although many will not do so until after age 65.''The most important screening methods to detect ''breast cancer'' include:''Early detection of breast cancer is important to every woman, regardless of risk factors, because the earlier a cancer is found, the smaller it is likely to be. Studies have clearly shown that the smaller the size of the breast cancer when detected, the better the chance of a surgical cure and long-term survival. Smaller breast cancers are also less likely to have already spread to ''lymph nodes'' and to other organs such as the ''lungs'', ''liver'', bones, and brain.''Mammograms can detect many small breast cancers long before they may be felt during breast examinations. There is extensive evidence that early detection by mammography has improved survival in women with this disease.''Some 10% to 15% of breast cancers are not detected through mammograms but are detected by breast examinations. Therefore a normal mammogram does not completely exclude the possibility of breast cancer, and breast self-examinations and breast examinations by a doctor remain important.'  breast examination by a trained professional, and mammography In November 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended against teaching breast self-examination, citing a lack of benefit for a monthly self-examination. Groups such as the American Cancer Society agree with this conclusion and do not offer guidance on exactly how often a woman should check her breasts, but do state that a woman should be aware of any changes in her breasts. Breast examination by a professional trained in breast examination. Mammography: In their revised recommendations issued in November 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force states that women age 40 to 49 do not require routine mammograms. They recommend biannual screening mammograms for women aged 49-74, and further state that: ""The decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take patient context into account, including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms."" However, The American Cancer Society (ACS) disagrees and recommends a baseline mammogram for all women by age 40 and annual mammograms for women 40 and older for as long as they are in good health. In women with ""lumpy breasts"" or breast symptoms, and also in women with a high risk of developing breast cancer, a baseline mammogram at 35 years of age is sometimes recommended. This recommendation is somewhat controversial, and there are other viewpoints. a history of breast cancer; first-degree relatives (mother, sister, or daughter) with breast cancer. The risk is especially higher if both the mother and sister have had breast cancers, if a relative developed her cancer before age 50, if the relative had breast cancer in both breasts, if there is both ovarian and breast cancers in the family, or if a male family member has been diagnosed with breast cancer"
High blood pressure (hypertension),"'About one-sixth of all Americans have ''high blood pressure'', and the incidence of this disease increases with age. Consequently, the proportion among adults is higher, and it is even higher among seniors. African-Americans are more likely than others to have ''high blood pressure''.''High blood pressure'' can cause arterial disease (''atherosclerosis'') that can lead to ''heart attack'', ''congestive heart failure'', ''stroke'', and ''kidney failure''.''High blood pressure'' can cause diseases without any early warning symptoms.''There is good evidence that treatment of high blood pressure can reduce the risk of ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and ''kidney failure''.''Actually, there is good evidence that adults with all degrees of high blood pressure can benefit from the lowering of blood pressure.

HPV types 16 and 18 are known to be the two viral types most frequently associated with pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix. Initial trials with the vaccine have shown that the HPV-16/18 vaccine is safe and induces a high degree of protection against HPV-16/18 infection. Gardasil is given in three injections over a six-month interval. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that girls 11-12 years of age receive the vaccine.

Colon cancer is curable if removed before spread occurs.''All healthy subjects should have stool occult blood tests and flexible sigmoidoscopy at age 50, followed by stool occult blood annually and flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years.''Alternatively, instead of flexible sigmoidoscopy, all healthy subjects can undergo screening colonoscopy at age 50 and then every 10 years if tests remain normal and there is no prior history of polyps or cancer.''Higher risk patients (individuals with a family history of colonic polyps or cancer, long-standing ''ulcerative colitis'', or a prior personal history of colon polyps or cancer) require colonoscopy earlier and more frequently.''Stool occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy have been documented to reduce colon cancer mortality by:'  Stool occult blood test: Stool occult blood test is a chemical test to detect trace amounts of blood in the stool. It is inexpensive and easily performed, though not always accurate. Some cancers are not detected by this test, and many positive tests are caused by other problems besides cancer. Flexible sigmoidoscopy: Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a relatively quick and easy office procedure which allows direct visualization and biopsy of suspicious lesions from the distal portion of the colon. The procedure is uncomfortable, and it is less accurate than a full colonoscopy. Colonoscopy: Colonoscopy allows visualization of the entire colon and is the most complete and thorough test. It requires intravenous sedation, is much more expensive, and is not covered by some insurance plans as a screening procedure. Although screening colonoscopies may have a slightly higher risk of complications than flexible sigmoidoscopies, both screening tests are very safe when performed by trained professionals. preventing colon cancer by identifying and removing polyps before they become cancerous. increasing cancer cure rate by identifying early cancer at a treatable stage before the cancer has spread (metastasized)."
Bladder cancer,"'(Note that bladder cancer is only one of many causes of blood in the urine.)''All people who are current or former ''cigarette'' ''smokers'' or who have a history of occupational exposure to certain chemicals such as those used in the dye, leather, tire, and rubber industries should have a urine examination for blood periodically after the age of 60 years.''Early bladder cancer may produce no symptoms and no gross blood in the urine. However, the blood is almost always visible microscopically.''Treatment can be effective if the cancer is detected early, and survival is strongly associated with the stage of disease at the time of initiation of treatment.''Cessation of ''cigarette smoking'' is always advisable.' Initial  screening for bladder cancer  is carried out by determining if there is blood in the urine (hematuria). This may be done using a dipstick that is placed in the urine. If positive, the urine should be examined under the microscope. Alternatively, the urine may be visualized microscopically without the dipstick being used. Bladder cancer can cause gross hematuria (a large amount of blood in the urine), or microscopic hematuria (the blood can only be seen with the aid of a microscope). Bladder cancer is only one of many causes of hematuria."
Glaucoma,"'Glaucoma'' is a condition with abnormally elevated intra-''ocular'' pressures (pressure within the eyeball).'""The American Academy of Ophthalmology's recommended intervals for eye exams, including ""'glaucoma'' screening, are:''Although there is no formal screening recommendation for healthy subjects with normal risk, everyone over 60 years of age should have periodic intra-ocular pressure measurements periodically, perhaps yearly.''Glaucoma can cause extensive damage of the retina, as well as\xa0irreversible ''loss of vision'' without warning symptoms and before the individual becomes aware of a loss of vision.''There is good evidence that treatment of ''elevated eye pressure''\xa0from glaucoma can prevent blindness.' Measurement of intra-ocular pressure should be a standard component of a comprehensive eye examination. Note that a checkup for vision does not always measure intra-ocular pressure. Intra-ocular pressure should be measured by eye care specialists. Have an eye examination every three to five years. Others should have an eye exam at least once during this period. Age 20-29: Individuals of African descent or a family history of glaucoma should have two screenings during this period. Age 30-39: Individuals of African descent or with a family history of glaucoma.  Age 40-64: Every two to four years. Age 65 or older: Every one to two years."
Melanoma and other skin cancers,'Melanoma'' is the most serious form of ''skin cancer''.'

Facts you should know about diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH)," DISH is characterized by unique, flowing calcification along the sides of the contiguous vertebrae of the spine. Symptoms of DISH include intermittent pains and stiffness in the areas of the bony changes of the spine and inflamed tendons. DISH is diagnosed when the characteristic flowing calcifications are detected with images of the spine, such as in plain film X-ray methods. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) can be helpful in both relieving pain and inflammation of DISH."
What is diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis?,"'Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis'' (DISH) is considered a form of ''degenerative arthritis'' or ''osteoarthritis''. However, DISH is characterized by unique, flowing calcification along the sides of the contiguous vertebrae of the spine. And, very unlike typical degenerative ''arthritis'"", it's also commonly associated with inflammation (tendinitis) and calcification of tendons at their attachments points to bone. This can lead to the formation of ""'bone spurs'', such as ''heel spurs'"". In fact, heel spurs are common among individuals with DISH. DISH has also been called Forestier's disease."" "
What causes diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis?,'It is not known what causes DISH. DISH is associated with the ''metabolic syndrome'' and is more frequent in people with ''diabetes mellitus''.' 
What are signs and symptoms of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis?,"'Symptoms of DISH include intermittent pains in the areas of the bony changes of the spine and inflamed tendons. Stiffness and dull ''pain'', particularly in the upper and lower back, are common. Sometimes pains in these areas can be sharp with certain body movements, such as twisting or bending over.''DISH is only slowly progressive. Calcifications between the vertebrae occur over many years. This calcification can lead to limitation of motion of the involved areas of the spine.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis?,"'DISH is diagnosed when the characteristic flowing calcifications are detected with images of the spine, such as in plain film X-ray methods.' "
What is the treatment for diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis?,"'Because areas of the spine and tendons can become inflamed, anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'') and ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), can be helpful in both relieving pain and inflammation of DISH. It is hoped that by minimizing inflammation in these areas, further calcification of tendons and ligaments of the spine leading to calcific bony outgrowths (''osteophytes'') will be prevented.'  "
What is the prognosis for patients with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis?,"'DISH often causes no symptoms, and the long-term outlook is generally good. DISH can lead to limitation of range of motion of the spine. There is no associated threat to any internal organs with this disorder. Rarely, large bone spurs can form in front of the spinal vertebrae of the neck. These spurs occasionally interfere with the passage of food through the upper ''esophagus'' (swallowing tube).' "
Is it possible to prevent diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis?,'There is no ''prevention'' of DISH.' 
Facts you should know about a dislocated ankle," An isolated dislocated ankle is a rare injury. Usually, there is an associated fracture of the bones that make up the ankle. The ankle usually dislocates as a result of a fall, motor-vehicle crash, or sporting injury causing damage to ligaments and bones. In addition to the bony injury, there can be damage to blood vessels, nerves, and skin. The diagnosis is often made clinically. The emergency treatment is to reduce the dislocation as soon as possible and then splint the ankle to prevent further damage. Orthopedic or podiatric consultation is usually required since surgery may be required depending upon the patient's situation. Arthritis is a common complication of an ankle dislocation. Most dislocated ankles result from accidental injury and are difficult to prevent."
What is a dislocated ankle?,"'The ankle is a hinge joint that connects the lower leg to the foot. The tibia and fibula of the leg come into contact with the talus of the foot, forming the ankle mortise. The majority of the weight bearing in the ankle occurs between the tibia and talus. While the shape of the mortise helps align the ankle joint, the surrounding ligaments are very important in providing stability.''A dislocated joint describes the situation where the bones that come together to form a joint no longer maintain that normal relationship. In the ankle, it means that the tibia and talus no longer maintain their normal anatomic relationship.''Most commonly, a dislocated ankle is associated with ''fractures'' of the distal ends of the tibia and fibula (called the malleolus) in association with damage to the ligaments that help support the ankle joint. Less commonly, isolated ligament injuries can result in the dislocation.' "
What are causes and risk factors for an ankle dislocation?,"'Ankle dislocations do not happen spontaneously but are a result of a ''trauma''. Forces are placed on the ankle that cause the bones to ''fracture'' or the ligaments to tear, resulting in the dislocation injury.''The ankle is an inherently stable joint and the direction of the dislocation depends upon the position of the foot and where the force arises. Ankle dislocations are more often associated with ''fractures'' of the bones that make up the joint.''Common causes of dislocations include falls, motor-vehicle crashes, and sports injuries.''The most common type of ankle dislocation is posterior, where the talus moves backward in relation to the tibia. For this to occur, the foot needs to be plantar flexed (the toes are pointing downward) when the injury occurs. The ankle is either forced inward from the outside (inversion) or outward from the inside (eversion), tearing the ligaments and tissues that hold the ankle stable.''Anterior dislocations, where the talus is pushed forward, occur when the foot is fixed or dorsiflexed (where the toes are pointed upward). The force from in front of the foot pushes the tibia backward.''Lateral dislocations occur when the ankle is twisted, either inverted or everted, but there are always fractures associated with either the medial or lateral malleolus or both.'""Superior dislocation describes where the talus is jammed upward, into the space between the tibia and fibula, as a result of an axial loading injury and is called a pilon injury. This may be due to landing on one's ""'feet'' from a fall or from being in a car wreck where the foot is held firm against the brake pedal.' "
What are dislocated ankle symptoms and signs?,"'Dislocations are ''painful'', and there is usually obvious deformity of the ankle joint. It may be very difficult or ''impossible to stand or walk''.''If the nerves that run across the ankle joint are damaged or inflamed, there can be numbness and ''tingling of the foot''.''There is almost immediate swelling of the ankle joint area and ecchymosis (''bruising'') may occur quickly.''Depending upon the mechanism of injury, there can be associated other injuries of the foot, knee, or spine.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose a dislocated ankle?,"'It is important for the health care professional to take a history as to how the injury occurred. Appreciating the mechanism helps makes sense of the injury and may help direct treatment. Past medical history and previous ankle injury may provide useful information.''The dislocated ankle is often diagnosed clinically by the appearance of the ankle. Physical examination can determine the abnormal relationship of the tibia, fibula, and talus. In addition to the ankle, the health care professional may also exam the structures of the foot and knee, looking for other potential associated injuries.''Because blood vessels and nerves can become stretched and damaged when the ankle dislocates, pulses and sensation in the foot are evaluated. Skin complications are common because as the skin stretches over a bony prominence when the ankle is dislocated, it can lose its blood supply and die.''X-ray is the initial diagnostic test used to determine the extent of injury, where the bones are in relation to each other and whether a fracture is present. Once the dislocation is reduced and the bones realigned, another post-reduction X-ray may be done to confirm that realignment is good (bones in normal position). Depending upon the situation, ''CT'' or ''MRI'' scans might be considered to evaluate damage to the joint surface, to look for occult or hidden fractures, and to assess the ligaments and tendons that surround and stabilize the ankle joint.' "
What is the treatment for a dislocated ankle?,"'Once the initial evaluation is complete, the goal of emergency treatment of an ankle dislocation begins with trying to reduce the injury, returning the bones as close as possible to their normal anatomic position. Often the bones will fall back into place with gentle traction. Sometimes medication is required to sedate the patient and help the surrounding muscles relax.''If there is evidence that the blood and nerve supply to the foot are in jeopardy or if the skin is tented and stretched and the clinical diagnosis of ankle dislocation is made, attempts to reduce the ankle joint may be necessary even before an X-ray is taken to preserve nerve and blood vessel function.''Once the ankle is reduced, examination of the blood and nerve supply to the foot is repeated and a temporary plaster or fiberglass splint is placed.''An orthopedic or podiatric consultation may need to occur emergently, especially if there are unstable fractures present, if nerve or artery damage exists, or if the ankle cannot be reduced and an emergency operation is needed.''Even if the ankle dislocation is reduced, many times an operation is eventually required to stabilize the structures that were damaged. The decision as to whether surgery is required and what type of surgery might be needed is individualized for each patient and their situation.'  "
What is the recovery time for a dislocated ankle?,"'After the initial treatment is complete, whether or not surgery is required, rehabilitation may take six to 12 weeks before returning the patient to their pre-injury activities.' "
What is the prognosis of an ankle dislocation?,"'While the goal for every injury is to return the patient to their pre-injury level of function, patients who have dislocated their ankle may not necessarily be able to achieve that goal.''When the ankle dislocates, blood supply to the cartilage that lines the bone within the joint may be damaged, eventually leading to ''arthritis'' (arthro=joint + it is=inflammation). As well, if the bones do not perfectly align after injury, the risk of arthritis in the future increases.''Arthritis of the joint may cause ''pain'' and ''stiffness''. Loss of range of motion in the ankle can alter gait, the motion of ''walking'', and subsequently affect other parts of the skeleton including the hips and back.' "
Is it possible to prevent a dislocated ankle?,"'A dislocated ankle is an accidental injury and most often cannot be prevented.''The risk factors are few:' Recurrent sprained ankles that cause the joint to be lax Weakness of the muscles that surround and support the ankle, especially the peroneal muscle Diseases that cause joints to be hypermobile (for example, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Down syndrome)"
What is a dislocated elbow? What are the types of elbow dislocations?,"'An elbow dislocation is when the forearm bones (radius and ulna) move out of place relative to their articulating joint formation with the humerus bone of the upper arm. There are several types of elbow dislocations based on their location and complexity:''In young children (ages less than about 4-5 years), the elbow dislocation is termed a ''radial head subluxation'' or '""nursemaid's elbow""'.' Simple Complex (involving bone fracture[s] and/or other problems) Posterior (about 90% of all elbow dislocations) Anterior Lateral Partially displaced"
What are the causes and risk factors of a dislocated elbow?,"""Falling onto an outstretched hand or a traumatic event like a car accident commonly cause an elbow dislocation. Risk factors include contact sports, gymnastics, rollerblading, and similar activities. In children, radial head subluxations may occur when the child's elbow is extended and then pulled or yanked (for example, pulling a child up off the floor by the child's arm, wrist, or hand)."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of a dislocated elbow?,"'The signs and symptoms of a dislocated elbow begin quickly after a dislocation and may include'""In children with nursemaid's elbow, signs and symptoms may include immediate pain in the injured arm/elbow, ""'anxiety'', and refusal or inability to move the injured arm/elbow. Usually, there is no sign of serious injury (no deformity, swelling, or bruising).'  a visible deformity, a pop sound at the time of injury, pain, swelling, stiffness, inability to bend the elbow, bruising, numbness/weakness in the arm, wrist, and/or hand."
How do doctors diagnose a dislocated elbow?,"""Doctors use X-rays (anteroposterior and lateral films) and CTs to diagnose a dislocated elbow. Many doctors take X-rays before and after the elbow undergoes reduction (being put back in its normal position). Medical professionals usually use CT and ultrasound with more complex dislocations. Unless there are indications of bone fractures, doctors do not use X-rays to diagnose a nursemaid's elbow. They use a patient's history and physical exam to make a diagnosis."" "
What are treatments and home remedies for a dislocated elbow?,"'Medical professionals should reduce the displacement as soon as possible to help avoid complications and minimize the time to recover in both children and adults. Rehab may be helpful for many adults after elbow joint reduction. Some patients may require an elbow brace to reduce discomfort from ''nerve pain''. Some patients require oral pain medications. Discuss home remedies like ice, heat, and rest with your doctor after elbow reduction.' "
What are complications of a dislocated elbow?,"'Complications of an elbow dislocation may include'""Untreated nursemaid's elbow may result in a limited ability to move the elbow."" brachial artery disruption, ulnar and/or median nerve problems, bone fractures, compartment syndrome, ectopic calcifications, and myositis. "
What is the prognosis and recovery time for a dislocated elbow?,"'Early treatment (reduction of the dislocation) and follow-up rehab of the dislocated elbow can result in a good prognosis. Long delays of reduction and complications can reduce the prognosis. Recovery times vary. An appropriately treated simple dislocation may recover in 3-6 weeks, but if the elbow joint is in the pitching arm, throwing recovery may take up to 3 months. Any complications increase recovery times.' "
Is it possible to prevent a dislocated elbow?,"'It may be possible to prevent some dislocations by avoiding risk factors. Wear protective gear while doing any activities that could cause a fall on an outstretched arm and do not pick up or swing a baby, toddler, or young child by an arm.' "
Facts you should know about hip dislocations," Hip dislocations occur most often as a 
result of motor vehicle crashes. They also can be an athletic injury, most 
commonly from football or downhill skiing trauma. The hip can dislocate forward or 
backward (anteriorly or posteriorly). Posterior dislocation of the hip is most 
common. It is important to try to relocate 
(reduce) the dislocated hip joint as soon as possible to prevent complications. Doctors usually accomplish reduction of the dislocated hip with 
traction, but an operation may be required if that is unsuccessful. A person may need physical therapy and rehabilitation for many months to regain normal function. Complications of hip dislocations 
include damage to the sciatic nerve, osteoarthritis, and death of the femur bone 
of the hip (avascular necrosis of the femoral head)."
What is a hip dislocation? What are the types of hip dislocations?,"'The hip is a ball and socket joint. The ball is the head of the femur or thighbone and the socket in the pelvis is called the acetabulum. Surrounding muscles and ligaments and a thick band of cartilage called the labrum stabilize the joint. A hip dislocation occurs when the femoral head is forcibly removed from the acetabulum.''Doctors describe hip dislocations according to where the femoral hip bone moves in relationship to the acetabulum. ' Posterior dislocations, where the 
femoral head moves backward, are most common and often occur from car wrecks 
and athletic injuries. Anterior hip dislocations occur when the 
femoral head pushes forward out of the socket of the acetabulum. This type of 
hip dislocation can occur in downhill skiing accidents. Patients who have had hip replacements 
can also dislocate their prosthetic hip. Developmental dysplasia of the hip 
(dys=bad + plasia=formation) is an abnormal design of the hip at birth (was formerly 
referred to as congenital hip dysplasia). Developmental dysplasia can lead to hip 
dislocation in infants and children."
What causes a dislocated hip?,"'Hip dislocations are an uncommon injury in a normal hip. It takes a lot of energy to dislocate a hip, and most dislocations of the hip are due to motor vehicle injuries. Athletic injuries most often occur in football and rugby, downhill skiing, and snowboarding.''In patients who have had hip replacements, a simple fall or abnormal movement may provide enough energy to dislocate the hip prosthesis.' "
What are risk factors for hip dislocations?,"'The risk of a hip dislocation exists with any high-impact, high-energy accident. Hip dislocations occur most commonly in motor vehicle crashes, pedestrians hit by cars and, less commonly, athletic injuries.' "
What are signs and symptoms of hip dislocations?,"'Pain'', deformity, ''muscle spasm'', and inability to move the hip are common symptoms and signs of hip dislocation. The patient will not be able to bear weight or stand on the hip.''On physical examination, the hip and leg will be in an abnormal position and there will be physical deformity.'   For posterior hip dislocations, the hip 
will be short and internally rotated, meaning that the foot will be pointing 
inward toward the midline of the body. Anterior hip dislocations will have a 
shortened leg with the foot externally rotated or pointing away from the midline 
of the body."
How do doctors diagnose a dislocated hip?,"'Physical examination often clinically diagnoses hip dislocations. The health care provider might be able to observe a deformity at the hip, as well as abnormal positioning of the hip. ''X-rays'' confirm the diagnosis of hip dislocation.''The health care provider will also look for complications associated with hip dislocation, including injury to the femoral artery that runs in front of the joint and the ''sciatic nerve'' located in the back of the hip.''Depending upon the situation, the health care provider may assess the patient for other injuries that might be present.' "
What is the treatment for a hip dislocation?,"'The initial treatment of a dislocated hip is to try to relocate it, replacing the femoral head into the hip socket. Because of ''pain'' and ''muscle spasm'' associated with the injury, the patient often requires medications for sedation and muscle relaxation to allow the hip to be relocated. There are different techniques that can be used to relocate the hip, but all involve traction on the leg to replace the femoral head back into the acetabulum. This is called closed reduction.''Sometimes the hip cannot be relocated, even with the patient undergoing general anesthesia. A ''CT scan'' may be needed to look for small bone fragments that may have fractured (broken off) off the acetabulum or pieces of torn ligament or cartilage that get in the way of the relocation. In this situation, open reduction is required, meaning that an orthopedic surgeon has to operate to remove any foreign objects in the joint and then reduce or replace the hip back into its socket. Sometimes doctors do this using arthroscopic surgery.''After hip reduction, physical therapy and rehabilitation will be required to return range of motion and regain strength in the muscles surrounding the hip.' "
What are complications of a dislocated hip?,"'Common complications include the following:' Sciatic nerve injury: The nerve runs 
behind the hip and can be stretched and damaged with a hip dislocation. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head 
(a=loss + vascular=blood supply; necrosis=death): The femoral head, or ball of 
the hip, gets its blood supply from small arteries that run along the ligaments 
that help hold the hip joint stable. These arteries can be stretched, damaged, or 
torn with a hip dislocation and the part of the bone that they supply can die 
(necrosis). This causes the hip joint to gradually lose its range of motion and 
potentially require hip joint replacement. For this reason, the goal is to 
reduce a dislocated hip as soon as possible. A follow-up MRI of the hip is usually recommended at 6 weeks to look for this 
complication. Osteoarthritis of the hip joint Recurrent hip dislocation: The 
structures that keep the hip stable may not heal adequately, leading to repeated 
dislocations."
What is the recovery time for a hip dislocation?,"'Physical therapy is important and begins with non-weight-bearing exercises that can start after the first week. This is important to prevent loss of range of motion.''Strengthening of leg muscles can begin when the patient is ''pain'' free and can walk without crutches, usually after 4-8 weeks.''If all goes well, it may take 3-4 months to return to full activity after a hip dislocation.' "
What is the prognosis for a dislocated hip?,'Hip dislocations are a significant injury and the prognosis depends upon how long it takes to reduce the dislocation and whether other structures are damaged.''About 70% of patients with posterior hip dislocations will have an associated acetabulum ''fracture''.''Approximately 10%-15% of patients with hip dislocation will have sciatic nerve injury.''About 2%-10% of patients with a hip dislocation will develop avascular necrosis of the femoral head if it is reduced within 6 hours.''Approximately 20% of patients with hip dislocation will eventually develop ''osteoarthritis'' in the hip joint.' 
Is it possible to prevent hip dislocation?,'Hip dislocations occur because of unexpected events and cannot be prevented.' 
Facts you should know about dislocated knees,"  Knee dislocations are a result of significant force or trauma. With a dislocated knee, the relationship between the femur and tibia is lost and at least three of four ligaments that hold the knee stable must be torn. Fractures often accompany the dislocation. Surgeons most often repair the torn knee ligaments to allow the knee to be stable and function again. Knee dislocations are a potential vascular emergency and can be associated with damage to the popliteal artery in the back of the knee. If the artery injury is not repaired within a few hours, there is high risk of leg amputation. Compartment syndrome is also a common complication. Physical therapy and postoperative rehabilitation is a long process and can last more than a year."
What causes a knee dislocation?,"'The knee is the leg joint where the femur (thighbone) meets the tibia (shinbone). Four ligaments cross the joint attaching to both the femur and tibia, stabilizing the knee:''The ''quadriceps'' muscles on the front of the thigh and the hamstrings on the back of the thigh add to the knee’s stability.''A knee dislocation is a relatively rare injury. It takes significant force and energy to dislocate the knee, and at least three of the four stabilizing ligaments need to be torn to lose the relationship between the femur and tibia. Common causes include motor vehicle crashes, car-pedestrian accidents, industrial accidents, athletic injuries, and falls. ''Fractures'' often accompany a knee dislocation.''The knee most commonly dislocates anteriorly or posteriorly, where the tibia is shoved forward or back compared to the femur. This can tear the popliteal artery that runs behind the knee and supplies the leg and foot with blood. The popliteal artery can suffer a partial or complete tear, and if medical professionals do not recognize and repair the damage quickly, the leg may require amputation.''An associated complication is ''compartment syndrome''. Muscles in the calf and shin are in compartments tightly bound by fascia (thick tissue). If there is swelling or bleeding in a compartment, the pressure can rise high enough to damage muscle tissue and prevent blood from flowing through the compartment to the foot.''Another complication of knee dislocation is damage to the peroneal nerve, which supplies the muscles that dorsiflex, or lift the toes and foot off the ground when we walk. Damage to this nerve can cause foot drop and numbness of part of the foot.''A knee dislocation is an orthopedic emergency and is different from a kneecap (patellar) dislocation, where the kneecap, located in front of the knee, slides laterally out of place. The ''knee joint'' itself is not involved in a kneecap dislocation. The treatment is to pop the kneecap back into place and start physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the kneecap to prevent recurrence.' Medial and lateral collateral ligaments (MCL, LCL) Anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL, PCL)"
What are signs and symptoms of a dislocated knee?,"'A knee dislocation is very painful, and marked swelling and deformity often accompany the injury. About half of knee dislocations will reduce or realign themselves spontaneously. The bones may look aligned, but the joint remains very unstable. The patient will have too much ''pain'' to lift the leg off the stretcher or to try and walk at all.''If there is damage to the peroneal nerve, the patient may complain of numbness in the foot and be unable to dorsiflex the foot or flex the toes in the direction of the nose.''If there is damage to the popliteal artery and no blood is pumping to the leg, the foot may be ''cold'' and develop increasing ''pain''.' "
How do doctors diagnose a knee dislocation?,"'The initial diagnosis of knee dislocation occurs by history and physical exam. The care provider will learn about mechanism of injury and the appearance of the leg at time of injury. Knee examination will look for swelling, areas of tenderness, and stability of the knee ligaments. Knee dislocations are associated with significant swelling and bleeding, and it may be difficult to appreciate on physical exam how unstable the knee might be. The provider needs to have a high index of suspicion to make the diagnosis.''The provider will also look for nerve and artery damage.''Medical professionals test for peroneal nerve damage by looking for decreased sensation on the top of the foot between the big and second toe and by assessing the ability for the patient to dorsiflex the foot (bend the toes back toward the nose).''Popliteal artery injury is an important concern. Doctors will check pulses in the foot (dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries) and in the back of the knee (popliteal artery). Hard signs of a popliteal injury include''Hard signs of popliteal artery injury will cause the patient to be taken immediately to the operating room for artery repair.''Because the risk of popliteal injury is so high, if hard signs aren’t present, medical professionals may perform other testing to look for artery damage:''If there is concern for ''compartment syndrome'', medical professional can insert needles into each of the four muscle compartments in the leg to directly measure the pressure within each compartment.''Medical professionals take plain ''X-rays'' to look for broken bones (fractures) and to determine the misalignment of the femur and tibia.''If there is no arterial damage and a doctor admits a patient to the hospital for continued observation for the potential of delayed injury, a medical professional may perform a knee ''MRI'' to better understand the extent of the injuries.' loss of pulses, enlarging hematoma (blood clot in the back of the knee), bruits (an audible sound heard with a stethoscope due to turbulent blood), thrills (palpable turbulent blood flow under the skin), and if there is a wound, pulsatile bleeding. The ankle-brachial (ABI) index compares blood pressures in the arm and leg. Lower leg blood pressure could signal artery damage. Doppler ultrasound of the leg blood vessels CT angiogram Doctors no longer routinely perform arteriography, where dye is injected directly into the artery."
What specialists treat dislocated knees?," Orthopedic surgeons operate to repair any bone injuries and fractures, as well as torn knee ligaments. Vascular surgeons are responsible for repairing artery injuries. Physical therapists help the patient recover from the injury, including recovering strength and range of motion in the leg."
What are treatments for dislocated knees?,"'Initial treatment and stabilization includes looking after the whole patient, including assessing and treating any other injuries that might be present.''If the knee is dislocated when the patient comes to the emergency department, a medical professional might attempt to relocate the knee dislocation, if possible, to minimize the risk of continued popliteal artery damage.''Knee dislocations are unstable. Most patients will require repair of their fractures and reconstruction of their torn ligaments. This requires an orthopedic surgeon to perform an operation.''Vascular surgeons are also actively involved in the care of knee dislocations because popliteal artery injuries can be catastrophic.''Observation for compartment syndrome is also an important part of the care. If this develops, the patient needs to go to the operating room to have a fasciotomy to relieve the pressure and save the muscle from damage.''Repairing damage to the popliteal vein or the peroneal nerve is controversial as to whether that repair is beneficial in the long term. The surgeon usually decides along with the patient as to the best course of action.' If there are hard signs of popliteal artery injury, a patient will go immediately to the operating room for artery repair. If hard signs are not present, medical professionals may evaluate of the artery with ABI measurements, ultrasound, or CT angiography. If there is evidence of injury, then the patient will go to the operating room for repair. Doctors often perform fasciotomy along with the artery repair to prevent the development of compartment syndrome. Physicians split open the thick tissues that divide the muscles in the lower leg to allow swelling to occur. If there is no arterial injury, doctors will observe a patient for 2-3 days in the hospital, with repeated testing to make certain that a delayed injury to the artery does not develop."
What is the recovery time for a dislocated knee?,"'After surgery, physical therapy, rehab treatment, and recovery time take months, lasting up to a year or more.' "
What are complications of knee dislocations?,"'The major complications of knee dislocation include the following:' Ligament damage to the knee: Three of the knee four ligaments (ACL, PCL, MCL, LCL) must tear for the knee to dislocate.

What is the prognosis for a dislocated knee?," About 60%-70% of patients with reconstructed knee dislocations have a good result with a functional painless knee. Approximately 10%-15% will have adequate function. Another 10%-15% will have a chronically unstable and painful knee. Patients may complain of instability with the knee giving way, recurrent swelling, decreased range of motion, and pain. In those patients who have a popliteal artery injury repaired more than 8 hours after injury, 80% will need a leg amputation. That complication falls to 20% if the artery repair occurs sooner."
What is dislocation of the shoulder? What causes a shoulder dislocation?,"'The shoulder joint is the most mobile joint in the body and allows the arm to move in many directions. This ability to move makes the joint inherently unstable and also makes the shoulder the most often dislocated joint in the body.''In the shoulder joint, the head of the humerus (upper arm bone) sits in the glenoid fossa, an extension of the scapula, or shoulder blade. Because the glenoid fossa (fossa = shallow ''depression'') is so shallow, other structures within and surrounding the shoulder joint are needed to maintain its stability. Within the joint, the labrum (a fibrous ring of cartilage) extends from the glenoid fossa and provides a deeper receptacle for the humeral head. The capsule tissue that surrounds the joint also helps maintain stability. The ''rotator cuff'' muscles and the tendons that move the shoulder provide a significant amount of protection and stability for the shoulder joint.'""Dislocations of the shoulder occur when the head of the humerus is forcibly removed from its socket in the glenoid fossa. It's possible to dislocate the shoulder in many different directions, and a ""'dislocated shoulder'' is described by the location where the humeral head ends up after it has been dislocated. Ninety-five percent or more of shoulder dislocations are anterior dislocations, meaning that the humeral head has been moved to a position in front of the joint. Posterior dislocations are those in which the humeral head has moved backward toward the shoulder blade. Other rare types of dislocations include luxatio erecta, an inferior dislocation below the joint, and intrathoracic, in which the humeral head gets stuck between the ribs.''Dislocations in younger people tend to arise from ''trauma'' and are often associated with sports (football, basketball, and volleyball) or falls. Older patients are prone to dislocations because of gradual weakening of the ligaments and cartilage that supports the shoulder. Even in these cases, however, there still needs to be some force applied to the shoulder joint to make it dislocate.''Anterior dislocations often occur when the shoulder is in a vulnerable position. A common example is when the arm is held over the head with the elbow bent, and a force is applied that pushes the elbow backward and levers the humeral head out of the glenoid fossa. This scenario can occur with throwing a ball or hitting a volleyball. Anterior dislocations also occur during falls on an outstretched hand. An anterior dislocation involves external rotation of the shoulder; that is, the shoulder rotates away from the body.''Posterior dislocations are uncommon and are often associated with specific injuries like lightning strikes, electrical injuries, and ''seizures''. On occasion, this type of dislocation can occur with minimal injury in the elderly, and because ''X-rays'' may not easily show a posterior dislocation, the diagnosis is often missed should the patient present for evaluation of ''shoulder pain'' and/or decreased range of motion of the shoulder joint.''A shoulder separation is a totally different injury and does not involve the gleno-humeral shoulder joint. Instead, the acromio-clavicular joint is involved. This is where the clavicle (collarbone) and acromion (part of the shoulder blade) come together in the front of the shoulder. A direct blow laterally, often from falling directly onto the outside part of the shoulder, damages the joint, the cartilage inside, and the numerous ligaments that maintain stability. While there may be ''pain'' and swelling at the end of the collarbone, the patient usually is able to somewhat move the shoulder itself.'  "
What are risk factors for a dislocated shoulder?,"'Shoulder dislocations tend to occur in two age groups:' Most frequently, the shoulder dislocates in younger adults due to a sporting injury. The second most common age group affected is the elderly patient who falls. As the body ages, the collagen fibers that are the building blocks of tendons, cartilage, and the labrum begin to break down and lose the tight-knit appearance that provides strength to the structures. With age, a reduced amount of trauma (usually a fall on an outstretched hand) is required to dislocate the shoulder."
What types of doctors treat a dislocated shoulder?,"'Patients with shoulder dislocations are often treated in an emergency department. Emergency specialists are trained to diagnose a shoulder dislocation and to reduce the joint. They are also trained in different methods of sedation.''Orthopedic doctors often provide follow-up care for patients with shoulder dislocations. They are the providers who would also decide whether surgery is required, either for the acute injury or after follow-up to stabilize the shoulder and prevent further dislocations.''Primary care providers, sports-medicine physicians, certified athletic trainers, and physical therapists all may have a role in caring for the patient during their initial treatment and recovery.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of a dislocated shoulder?,"'Dislocations hurt. When the humerus is forcibly pulled out of the socket, cartilage, muscle, and other tissues are stretched and torn. Shoulder dislocations present with significant ''pain'', and the patient will often refuse to move the arm in any direction. The muscles that surround the shoulder joint tend to go into spasm, making any movements very painful. Usually, with anterior dislocations, the arm is held slightly away from the body, and the patient tries to relieve the pain by supporting the weight of the injured arm with the other hand. Often, the shoulder appears squared off since the humeral head has been moved out its normal place in the glenoid fossa. Sometimes, it may be seen or felt as a bulge in front of the shoulder joint.''As with other bony injuries, the pain may provoke systemic symptoms of ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ''sweating'', ''lightheadedness'', and ''weakness''. These occur because of the stimulation of the vagus nerve, which blocks the adrenaline response in the body. Occasionally, this may cause the patient to faint or pass out (''vasovagal'' ''syncope'').'  "
How do physicians diagnose dislocated shoulders?,"'When a patient presents with a shoulder dislocation, pain control and joint relocation are primary considerations. However, it is still important for the health care professional to take a careful history to understand the mechanism of injury and the circumstances surrounding it. It will also be important to know if this is the first shoulder dislocation or whether the joint has been previously injured. In addition, questions may be asked about medications, ''allergies'', time of the last meal, and past medical history to prepare for a potential anesthetic administration to help relocate, or reduce, the shoulder dislocation.''Physical examination of the shoulder will begin with inspection. In an anterior dislocation, the shoulder appears to look ""squared off,"" with a loss of the normal rounded appearance of the shoulder caused by the deltoid muscle. In thinner patients, the humeral head may be palpated or felt in front of the joint. Posterior dislocations may be difficult to assess just by looking at the shoulder joint.''Pain and ''muscle spasm'' accompany dislocated joints, and a shoulder dislocation is no different. When the joint is disrupted, the muscles surrounding it are stretched and go into spasm. The patient will experience significant pain and will often resist the smallest movement of any part of the arm. The health care professional may feel for pulses in the wrist and elbow, as well as test for sensation to assess the blood and nerve supply to the arm. One place where sensation is tested is the lateral or outside part of the shoulder, also called the deltoid badge area. Numbness may signal damage to the arteries and nerves when the shoulder is dislocated. The brachial plexus, the axillary artery, and axillary nerve are located in the armpit and are relatively unprotected.''Plain X-rays may be taken to confirm the diagnosis of shoulder dislocation and to make certain there are no broken bones associated with the dislocation. Two common fractures are the Hill-Sachs deformity, a compression ''fracture'' of the humeral head, and a Bankart lesion, a chip fracture of the glenoid fossa. While these may be present, they do not hinder the relocation of the shoulder. Other fractures of the humerus and scapula may make shoulder reduction more difficult.''Since the body is 3-D and X-rays are 2-D, at least two X-rays are taken to be able to accurately assess where the humeral head is located -- anteriorly (in front) or posteriorly (behind) in relationship to the glenoid. Extra X-ray views also better assess the bones, looking for fracture.''In certain circumstances, (often on the athletic field) if a health care professional is present at the time of injury, an attempt may be made to reduce or relocate the shoulder immediately without X-rays being taken. Using manipulation described below, before the muscles have a chance to go into spasm, it is possible to relocate the shoulder. Imaging of the injured shoulder (X-ray or ''MRI'') would then be considered at a later time.'  "
What are home remedies for a dislocated shoulder?,"'When a shoulder injury occurs and there is concern about a fracture or dislocation, the patient likely needs to seek medical attention urgently.''Initial ''first aid'' at the scene may include''It is also important to make certain that no other injury has occurred. If needed, it may be appropriate to call 911 and activate emergency medical services.''Some patients who have had previous shoulder dislocations and have unstable joints may be able to reduce (relocate) their shoulder spontaneously when they feel it pop out of the joint.' immobilizing the shoulder, perhaps by placing it into a sling, applying ice packs to the affected area, and not allowing the patient to have anything to eat or drink, in case sedation is required to reduce the shoulder. Vomiting may occur as a side effect of some of the medications used for sedation, and it is best to have an empty stomach to prevent complications."
What is the treatment for a dislocated shoulder?,"'The purpose of the initial treatment of a dislocated shoulder is to reduce the dislocation and return the humeral head to its normal place in the glenoid fossa. There are a variety of methods that may be used to achieve this goal. The decision as to which one to use depends upon the patient, the situation, and the experience of the clinician performing the reduction. Regardless of the technique used, the hope is to be able to efficiently reduce the dislocation with a minimum of anesthesia required. Most attempts at closed reductions are successful; that is, no incision or cut is made into the joint to assist in returning the bones to their normal position. The term ""open reduction"" refers to performing surgery to repair the dislocation. Common methods for reduction of a shoulder dislocation are described below.''The patient may be sitting up or lying prone. The health care professional attempts to rotate the shoulder blade, dislodging the humeral head, and allowing spontaneous relocation. An assistant may be needed to help stabilize the arm.''With the patient lying flat or sitting up, the health care professional flexes the elbow to 90 degrees and gradually rotates the shoulder outward (external rotation). Muscle spasm may be able to be overcome after five to 10 minutes of gentle pushing, allowing the shoulder to spontaneously relocate. The Milch technique adds gentle lifting of the arm above the head to achieve reduction.''With the patient lying flat, a sheet is looped around the armpit. While the health care professional pulls down on the arm, an assistant, located at the head of the bed, pulls on the sheet to apply counter traction. As the muscles relax, the humeral head is able to return to its normal position.''With the patient lying prone (on their stomach), the injured arm is draped over the side of the cot and a weight is attached to it to gradually overcome muscle spasm and allow the shoulder joint to reduce.''Other potential options for relocating a shoulder dislocation include the Milch technique, axillary traction, and the Spaso technique.''In rare circumstances, the shoulder cannot be reduced using closed reduction techniques because a tendon, ligament, or piece of ''broken bone'' gets caught in the joint, preventing return of the humeral head into the glenoid. When closed reduction fails, it may be necessary for an orthopedic surgeon to perform an operation or open reduction.''Depending upon the amount of pain and spasm present, medication may be needed to sedate and comfort the patient prior to and during the reduction procedure. These medications may also be given to relax the muscles to aid in the joint reduction.''Patients receiving intravenous medications need to have their vital signs monitored before, during, and after the shoulder relocation just as if they were in the operating room. In some circumstances (for example a patient with underlying lung or ''heart'' illnesses), the presence of an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist may be appropriate during the relocation. Health care professionals use intravenous ''sedatives'', narcotics, and muscle relaxants in combination for analgesia (to relieve pain), relax muscles, and help promote ''amnesia'' of the events.''Common procedural medications now include ketamine or propofol.''Other medications include narcotics (morphine, hydromorphone, and ''fentanyl''), which may be combined with muscle relaxants (midazolam, ''diazepam'', ''lorazepam'').''Some health care professionals may consider using intra-articular (intra = within + articular = joint) injections of ''lidocaine'' (''Xylocaine'') into the shoulder joint as local anesthesia to try to reduce the shoulder, instead of using intravenous sedation.'  "
What happens after reduction of a shoulder dislocation?,"'Once the shoulder has been reduced, the health care professional will want to reexamine the arm and make certain that no nerve or artery damage occurred during the reduction procedure. A post reduction X-ray is recommended to reassess the bones and insure that the shoulder is properly relocated.''Significant damage occurs to the joint with a shoulder dislocation. The labrum and joint capsule have to tear, and there may be associated injuries to the ''rotator cuff'' muscles. These are the structures that lend stability to the shoulder joint, and since they are injured, the shoulder is at great risk to dislocate again.''A sling or shoulder immobilizer may be used as a reminder not to use the arm and allow the muscles that surround the joint to relax and not have to support the bones against gravity.''For a patient who sustains their first shoulder dislocation, the clinician will often immobilize the shoulder in mild external rotation, meaning that the arm is placed in a special sling that supports the arm away from the body.''The physician may place repeated dislocations in a regular sling or immobilizer for comfort and support.''The length of time a sling is worn depends upon the individual patient. A balance must be reached between immobilizing the shoulder to prevent recurrent dislocation and losing range of motion if the shoulder has been kept still for too long.''Once a clinician reduces a shoulder dislocation, much of the pain abates. Physicians may recommend ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'') or ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') for pain control and may prescribe a few narcotic pain pills like ''codeine'' or ''hydrocodone'' for the short term.''Ice is an important component of pain control, helping to decrease the swelling associated with the injury.'""In certain situations, it's possible to reduce dislocations immediately. This is especially true in the sports medicine arena, where a health care professional may reduce the dislocation on the field of play. This is a reasonable treatment alternative because the care provider was able to see the injury occur, examine the patient and come to the diagnosis, and then reduce the injury before muscles spasm sets in.""'Many patients experience shoulder subluxation or partial dislocation. These are patients who have had previous dislocations and are aware that their shoulder has dislocated again and then spontaneously reduced. They may choose not to seek urgent or emergent care, but this situation should not be ignored. Once a shoulder dislocates, it becomes unstable and more prone to future dislocation and injury.' "
What is appropriate follow-up following a shoulder dislocation? How long is the recovery time for a dislocated shoulder?,"'Follow-up with a primary care provider or orthopedic surgeon is advised after a shoulder dislocation. The decision as to when to begin range-of-motion exercises of the shoulder has to be individualized for each patient. In shoulder dislocations not associated with a fracture or other associated injury, younger patients may be kept immobilized for two to three weeks. In the elderly, this time frame may shrink to only a week because the risk of a ''frozen shoulder'' (a joint that becomes totally immobile) is markedly increased.''It may be necessary to get X-rays or a ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI), depending upon the patient and the situation, to evaluate the extent of potential injury to the joint, including the bones, labrum, and cartilage.''Some patients may be candidates for surgery to prevent future dislocations. The decision depends upon the extent of damage to the joint and the type of activities in which the patient participates. This decision is individualized for each patient.''Physical therapy is an important component to return the shoulder joint to normal function. Therapy may include exercises to strengthen the muscles that surround the shoulder and to maintain range of motion of the shoulder joint.''The total rehabilitation and recovery time from a shoulder dislocation is about 12-16 weeks.' "
What are potential complications of a shoulder dislocation?,"'Fractures of the bones that make up the shoulder joint are a possible complication of shoulder dislocations. Up to 25% of patients will have an associated fracture. Not included in these numbers are the Hill-Sachs deformity that may occur in up to 75% of anterior shoulder dislocations.''Nerve damage is a potential complication. Most often, the circumflex axillary nerve is injured. The first sign of injury is numbness in a small patch distribution on the outside of the upper arm. This nerve often recovers spontaneously in a few weeks, but this is an important complication for the health care professional to recognize since damage to the nerve may cause weakness of the deltoid muscle that helps move the shoulder.''Older patients who dislocate their shoulder may have rotator cuff injuries. The diagnosis may be difficult to make initially, and often the health care professional will make the diagnosis during a follow-up visit.''Rare complications of shoulder dislocations include tearing of the axillary artery, the main artery that supplies blood to the arm and brachial plexus injury, in which the nerve bundle that attaches the arm nerves to the spinal cord is damaged. Both of these structures are located in the axilla or armpit and are potentially damaged by the initial dislocation or by attempts to reduce the dislocation.'  "
What is the prognosis of a shoulder dislocation?,"'The goal of shoulder dislocation treatment is to reduce the shoulder and then to strengthen the tissues surrounding the joint to prevent recurrent dislocations. Age is the major factor as to whether there will be another dislocation. The younger the patient, the more likely that another dislocation will occur.' If the first dislocation happens before age 20, there may be up to a 95% chance that there will be a second dislocation in the future. With an age younger than 40, the risk of future dislocation is less than 50%. With an age older than 40, this risk drops to 10%."
Is it possible to prevent a dislocated shoulder?,"'Accidents and injuries happen, and the first dislocated shoulder usually cannot be prevented. The risk of recurrent dislocations may be decreased by following the physical therapy care plan after that first dislocation to strengthen and stabilize the shoulder. This includes wearing the sling for the appropriate amount of time, committing to the rehabilitation program, and keeping the shoulder muscles strong.' "
"What is the difference between antisocial personality disorder, sociopathy, and psychopathy?","'Psychopathy and sociopathy, although not mental health disorders formally recognized by the American Psychiatric Association, are more severe forms of antisocial personality disorder. Specifically, in order for a medical professional to diagnose someone as a psychopath, a person must have a lack of remorse or guilt about their actions in addition to demonstrating antisocial behaviors. Other core symptoms of this condition include a severe lack of caring for others, a lack of emotion, overconfidence, selfishness, and a higher propensity for planned aggression compared to sociopaths or other people with antisocial personality disorder. They are more likely to be able to maintain steady employment and to seem to have normal relationships compared to sociopaths. Mental health providers believe psychopaths are born lacking the ability to feel guilt rather than being associated with a history of ''trauma'' (like abuse, neglect, or exposure to community violence). While statistics indicate that 50%-80% of incarcerated individuals have antisocial personality disorder, only 15% of those convicted criminals have been shown to have the more severe antisocial personality disorder type of psychopathy.'""Psychopaths tend to be highly suspicious or paranoid, even compared to people with antisocial personality disorder. The implications of this suspicious stance can be dire, in that paranoid thoughts (ideations) tend to lead the psychopathic person to interpret all aggressive behaviors toward them, even those that are justified, as being arbitrary and unfair. A televised case study of a psychopath provided a vivid illustration of the resulting psychopathic anger. Specifically, the criminal featured in the story apparently abducted a girl and sexually abused her over the course of a number of days in an attempt to prove to investigating authorities that his stepdaughter's allegations that he sexually abused her were false.""'Although people often use the terms psychopathy and sociopathy interchangeably, researchers describe sociopaths as having a higher tendency toward impulsive behaviors and angry outbursts and if they form any connection to other people it is usually with other sociopaths. They are also less likely to be able to maintain steady employment or to give the appearance of having normal relationships compared to psychopaths.' "
What are causes and risk factors of antisocial personality disorder?,"'One of the most frequently asked questions about antisocial personality disorder by both professionals and laypeople is whether it is genetic. Many wonder if it is hereditary, just as much as hair, eye, or skin color; if this were the case, children of antisocial people would be highly expected to become antisocial themselves, whether or not they live with the antisocial parent. Fortunately, human beings are just not that simple. Like all personality disorders, and most mental disorders, antisocial personality disorder tends to be the result of a combination of biologic/genetic and environmental factors.'""Although there are no clear biological causes for this disorder, studies on the possible neurodevelopmental risk factors for developing antisocial personality disorder reveal that, in those with the illness, the part of the brain that is primarily responsible for learning from one's mistakes and for responding to sad and fearful facial expressions (the amygdala) tends to be smaller and respond less robustly to the happy, sad, or fearful facial expressions of others. That lack of response may have something to do with the lack of empathy that antisocial individuals tend to have with the feelings, rights, and suffering of others. While some individuals may be more vulnerable to developing antisocial personality disorder because of their particular genetic background, that is thought to be a factor only when the person is also exposed to life events such as abuse or neglect that tend to put the person at risk for development of the disorder. Similarly, while there are some theories about the role of ""'premenstrual syndrome'' (''PMS'') and other hormonal fluctuations in the development of antisocial personality disorder, the disorder cannot be explained as the direct result of such problems.''Other conditions that are risk factors for antisocial personality disorder include ''substance abuse'', attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (''ADHD''), ''reading disorder'', or conduct disorder, which is diagnosed in children. People who experience a temporary or permanent brain dysfunction, often also called organic ''brain damage'', are at risk for developing violent or otherwise criminal behaviors. Theories about the life experiences that increase the risk for developing antisocial symptoms in teenagers and adults provide important clues for its ''prevention''. Examples of such life experiences include a history of ''prenatal'' drug exposure or malnutrition, childhood physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; neglect; deprivation or abandonment; associating with peers who engage in antisocial behavior; or a parent who is either antisocial or alcoholic.'  "
What are antisocial personality disorder symptoms and signs?,"'To understand antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or APD), it is necessary to learn what having any personality disorder involves. As defined by the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders'' (''DSM-V'"", 2013), a personality disorder (PD) is a consistent, enduring pattern of inner experiences and behaviors that is significantly different from what is thought to be consistent with the individual's own social and cultural norms.""'Mental health professionals group personality disorders based on a commonality of symptoms.''Cluster A personality disorders are those that include symptoms of social isolation, and/or strange, eccentric behavior. These disorders include''Cluster B personality disorders are those that involve dramatic or erratic behaviors (counter-social behaviors). These personality disorders include''Cluster C personality disorders have difficulties with ''anxiety'' and inhibited behavior. These disorders include''Antisocial personality disorder is specifically a persistent pattern of disregarding and violating the rights of others. Called dissocial personality disorder internationally, the United States-based ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5'') describes antisocial personality disorder as having diagnostic criteria of a pattern of inner experiences and behaviors that must include at least three of the following specific signs and symptoms:''Other important characteristics of this disorder include that medical professionals do not diagnose this disorder in children (individuals younger than 18 years of age), but the affected person must have shown symptoms of this diagnosis (conduct disorder) at least since 15 years of age. Additionally, a medical professional cannot diagnose antisocial personality disorder if the person only shows symptoms of antisocial personality disorder at the same time they are suffering from ''symptoms of schizophrenia'' or of ''bipolar disorder''. Describing ''bipolar disorder'' as one of the exclusion criteria (diagnoses whose presence means that the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder cannot be assigned) is a change from how this disorder was described in the previous diagnostic manual in the United States, the ''DSM-IV-TR'' (''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision''). The ''DSM-IV'' described having a ''manic'' episode as the exclusion criterion with ''schizophrenia'', not having the depressive aspect of ''bipolar disorder'' as an exclusion criterion.''Intermittent explosive disorder is a recognized diagnosis whose symptoms involve aggression that is excessive in response to its trigger. People may mistake its symptoms for those of antisocial personality disorder. ''Misophonia'', a newly described diagnosis not recognized in the ''DSM-V'', has symptoms that include the sufferer responding to being provoked to anger and impulsive aggression by sights or sounds that are innocuous to most people. The aggression of this disorder may also be mistaken for antisocial personality disorder.''Antisocial personality disorder tends to occur in about 1% of women and 3% of men in the United States. Antisocial personality symptoms in women tend to include self-harm and more of the other ''symptoms of borderline personality disorder'' (''BPD'') than in men.'   paranoid personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder. antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder. avoidant personality disorder, dependent personality disorder, obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCD).

What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose antisocial personality disorder?,"""There is no specific definitive test, such as a blood test, that can accurately assess whether a person has antisocial personality disorder. Mental health practitioners like psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, or clinical psychologists conduct a mental health interview that gathers information to look for the presence of the symptoms previously described. Due to the use of a mental health interview in making the diagnosis and the fact that this disorder can be quite resistant to treatment, it is important that the mental health practitioner know to assess the symptoms in the context of the person's culture so the individual is not assessed as having antisocial personality disorder when he or she does not. Unfortunately, research shows that many practitioners lack the knowledge, experience, and sometimes the willingness to factor cultural context into their assessments."" "
What are the treatments for antisocial personality disorder?,"'Another very common question asked is, can antisocial personality disorder be cured? While it can be quite resistant to change, research shows there are a number of effective treatments for this disorder. For example, teenagers who receive therapy that helps them change the thinking that leads to their maladaptive behavior (cognitive behavioral ''psychotherapy'') experience a significant decrease the incidence of engaging in repeat antisocial behaviors.''On the other hand, attempting to treat antisocial personality disorder like other conditions is not often effective. For example, programs that have tried to use a purely reflective (insight-oriented talk therapy) approach to treating ''depression'' or ''eating disorders'' in people with antisocial personality disorder often worsen rather than improve outcomes in those individuals. In those cases, firm but fair behavior therapy to reward appropriate actions and programming that emphasizes teaching individuals with antisocial personality disorder the skills that one can use to live independently and productively within the rules and limits of society has been the more effective treatment for this condition. Family therapy that helps loved ones of people with antisocial personality disorder appropriately cope with the negative behaviors and promote the positive behaviors of the antisocial personality disorder sufferer can also be an important part of treatment for this condition.''While ''clinical trials'' indicate that medications do not directly treat the behaviors that characterize antisocial personality disorder, they can be useful in addressing conditions that co-occur with this condition. Specifically, ''depressed'' or anxious individuals who also have antisocial personality disorder may benefit from ''antidepressants'' like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), or ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), and those who exhibit impulsive anger may improve when given mood stabilizers like ''lithium'', ''divalproex'' (''Depakote''), or ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal'').'  "
What are complications if antisocial personality disorder is not treated? What is the prognosis of antisocial personality disorder?,"'Some long-term societal costs of antisocial personality disorder, like the suffering endured by victims of the crimes committed by people with this disorder, are clear. However, when people with ASPD are the charismatic leaders of religious cults, the devastation they can create is often not known unless and until a catastrophe occurs. The multiple murders orchestrated by Charles Manson and the mass ''suicide'' that occurred at the command of the Reverend Jim Jones in Guyana in 1978 are just two such examples.''Individuals who suffer from antisocial personality disorder have a higher risk of abusing ''alcohol'' and other ''drugs'' and repeatedly committing crimes. Imprisonment is a potential consequence. People with antisocial personality disorder are also vulnerable to mood problems, such as ''major depression'', ''anxiety'', and bipolar disorder; having other personality disorders, especially borderline (''BPD'') and narcissistic personality disorders; self-mutilation and other forms of self-harm, as well as dying from homicide, suicide, or accident.''Antisocial personality disorder tends to make the prognosis of virtually any other condition more problematic. Having antisocial personality disorder makes the treatment for problems of substance abuse or emotional or physical substance dependence more difficult. People who have both antisocial personality disorder and ''schizophrenia'' are less likely to comply with treatment programs and are more likely to remain institutionalized in a prison or a hospital. These risks amplify if antisocial personality disorder is not treated. Statistics indicate that many people with antisocial personality disorder experience a remission of symptoms by the time they reach 50 years of age.' "

What is Asperger's syndrome?,"""Asperger's syndrome, also known as Asperger disorder or Asperger syndrome, is one of a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that have effects on an individual's behavior, use of language and communication, and pattern of social interactions. Asperger disorder was formerly characterized as one distinct ""'autism'' spectrum disorder (others included autistic disorder, Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and ''pervasive developmental disorder'""-not otherwise specified [PDD-NOS]), although Asperger's syndrome was considered to be at the milder, or higher-functioning, range of this spectrum. There is still some controversy as to whether Asperger's syndrome should be regarded as a separate clinical entity or simply represents a high-functioning form of ""'autism''. In the revised ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (''DSM-5'"") published in May 2013, Asperger's syndrome and autistic disorder have been combined into one condition for diagnostic purposes, known as ASD. This change was controversial, because many experts believe that people formerly diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome will not meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD. Also, many experts feel that Asperger's syndrome should be preserved as a separate diagnostic entity to represent a condition related to, but not the same as, autism. Those diagnosed with Asperger's disorder were felt to have a higher-functioning form of autism or autism-related condition. People with Asperger's syndrome typically have normal to above-average intelligence but typically have difficulties with social interactions and often have pervasive, absorbing interests in special topics.""'Asperger\'s syndrome is named for Dr. Hans Asperger, an Austrian pediatrician, who first described the condition in 1944. Dr. Asperger described four boys who showed ""a lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships, one-sided conversation, intense absorption in a special interest, and clumsy movements."" Because of their obsessive interests in and knowledge of particular subjects, he termed the boys ""little professors."" The American Psychiatric Association (APA) recognized Asperger disorder as a specific entity and published diagnostic criteria in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV'' (''DSM-IV'') in 1994. Most recently, after significant deliberation, the APA recommended ""subsuming"" Asperger\'s Disorder into Autism Spectrum Disorders for the next edition of the ''DSM-V''.''Today, many experts in the field ''stress'' the particular gifts and positive aspects of Asperger syndrome and consider it to represent a different, but not necessarily defective, way of thinking. Positive characteristics of people with Asperger syndrome have been described as beneficial in many professions and include:''Dr. Temple Grandin, a noted engineer, author, and professor who suffers from Asperger disorder believes that her condition has been an asset in her professional life. Her life and story was featured in a film that first aired in 2010.'""Although the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome is not possible without direct testing and observation of an individual, it has been suggested by some authors that many successful historical figures may have had Asperger's syndrome, including Mozart, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Marie Curie. Of course, definitive diagnosis of historical figures with Asperger's syndrome is not possible, and many of the traits exhibited by people with Asperger's syndrome can also occur because of intellectual giftedness or even ""'attention deficit disorder'' (''ADD'').'   the increased ability to focus on details, the capacity to persevere in specific interests without being swayed by others' opinions, the ability to work independently, the recognition of patterns that may be missed by others, intensity, and an original way of thinking."
What causes Asperger's syndrome?,"""If one accepts the conclusion that Asperger's syndrome is one of the autistic disorders, then the causes of Asperger's syndrome would be expected to be the same as the causes of autism. The precise causes of autistic disorders have not been identified, although an ""'inherited'"" (genetic) component is believed to be involved. Supporting this idea is the fact that Asperger's syndrome has been observed to run in families. In some cases, autistic disorders may be related to toxic exposures, teratogens, problems with ""'pregnancy'' or birth, and ''prenatal'' infections. These environmental influences may act together to modify or potentially increase the severity of the underlying genetic defect.''Some authors have suggested a causal role for ''vaccine'' exposure (particularly ''measles'' vaccine and thimerosal, a mercury preservative used in some ''vaccines'') in autism. However, the overwhelming majority of epidemiologic evidence shows no evidence for an association between immunizations and autism, and experts have discredited this theory.' "
How common is Asperger's syndrome?,"""Asperger's syndrome is five times more common in boys than in girls. In recent years, the number of autism spectrum disorders has increased dramatically in the U.S. The reason for the increase is not fully clear, but is likely due to both improvements and modifications in the diagnostic process that result in an increase in the number of children being identified, as well as some degree of true increase in the incidence of the disorders themselves. The CDC notes one out of every 59 children in the U.S. has an autism spectrum disorder.""""Asperger's syndrome has been estimated to affect two and a half out of every 1,000 children, based upon the total number of children with autistic disorders."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of Asperger's syndrome?,"""Social-behavioral symptoms can begin as early as infancy. Characteristic differences are seen in social development, but these changes are hard to identify in toddlers and may be attributed to another condition or not perceived as abnormal. Most cases of Asperger's syndrome are identified when the child is school-aged or older; studies have shown an average age at diagnosis of 11 years. Some of the symptoms that may be present are:""""Another defining characteristic of Asperger's syndrome is the presence of perseverative and obsessive interests in special topics (such as cars or trains, or even more narrow topics such as vacuum cleaners), which may be of little interest to others.""""Language development in children with Asperger's syndrome is generally normal, in contrast to other autistic conditions. Children with Asperger's syndrome have normal scores on tests for language function involving vocabulary, syntax, and grammar. In fact, some experts believe the presence of normal language development distinguishes Asperger's syndrome from high-functioning autism. However, the use or application of language skills is altered in people with Asperger's syndrome:""""In school, children with Asperger's syndrome tend to excel with the rote learning often required in the early grades. As they get older, they may have more difficulties in school due to the nature of reading comprehension and written assignments. Special education support is sometimes, but not always, necessary.""'Sometimes, people with Asperger disorder have other associated psychiatric conditions or may show behaviors that are typical for other conditions. Some common associated conditions include the following (but these are not always present):'   lack of social awareness; lack of interest in socializing/making friends; difficulty making and sustaining friendships; inability to infer the thoughts, feelings, or emotions of others; either gazing too intently or avoiding eye contact; lack of changing facial expression, or use of exaggerated facial expressions; lack of use or comprehension of gestures; inability to perceive nonverbal cues or communications; failure to respect interpersonal boundaries; unusually sensitive to noises, touch, odors, tastes, or visual stimuli; inflexibility and over-adherence to or dependence on routines; and stereotypical and repetitive motor patterns such as hand flapping or arm waving. These interests are unusually repetitive and intense when compared to other children's interests. Specific or narrow interests remain the focus of the child's interest and conversation in spite of efforts to redirect the child's attention. Their speech may be disorganized or not relevant to the discussion, or they may focus too intently on their defined area of interest (see above) in conversations. The child may switch topics for no apparent reason in conversation, often in an attempt to steer the conversation toward his or her area of interest. Changes in voice and speaking (for example, speaking too loudly or dramatically, using an invariant tone or incorrect intonation, loud pitch, or speaking too rapidly or too slowly) can also be seen. Language may be interpreted literally, and difficulties can arise with interpreting language in a specific context. There are difficulties with understanding the subtle use of language, such as irony or sarcasm. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Anxiety disorder Oppositional defiant disorder or other disruptive behavior disorders Depression or other mood disorders"
How do medical professionals diagnose Asperger's syndrome?,"'Diagnosis is based upon interviews and observation of the individual along with interviews of his/her family members and sometimes teachers or counselors. The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' is published by the American Psychiatric Association and includes the diagnostic criteria for all recognized psychiatric conditions.''The ''DSM-IV'"" had specific diagnostic criteria for Asperger's syndrome. However, revision of the ""'DSM-IV'' was carried out, with a fifth edition (''DSM-V'"") published in May 2013. In this new version, Asperger's syndrome is included in the same diagnostic group as people with autism and pervasive developmental disorders.""  "
What are the risks or complications of Asperger's syndrome?,"""As mentioned before, Asperger's syndrome may coexist with other psychiatric conditions such as ""'attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'') or ''anxiety'' disorder. Even when ''anxiety'"" disorder is not present, people with Asperger's syndrome may suffer from ""'anxiety'' or hypersensitivity to certain stimuli such as loud noises. In some cases, disruptive behaviors (tantrums, self-injury, and ''aggression'') and/or ''depression'"" may occur in response to the anxiety and frustration experienced by sufferers of Asperger's syndrome. Other behaviors that have been reported in people with Asperger's syndrome include obsessive-compulsive behaviors and difficulties with anger management.""""As with any condition, the degree of severity of symptoms can vary widely among individuals, and not all persons with Asperger's syndrome will experience associated psychiatric disorders, ""'depression'', or disruptive behaviors.' "
What are the treatments for Asperger's syndrome?,"""Treatment of Asperger's syndrome involves a multidisciplinary approach.""""Medical therapy is not effective in treating Asperger syndrome, although medications may be prescribed to help control troubling symptoms or symptoms of other psychiatric conditions that may coexist with Asperger's syndrome. In some cases, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications are used for relief of anxiety or depression. Medical treatments for ""'ADHD'' may also be tried if there is significant ''hyperactivity'' and/or distraction.'""A number of behavioral therapies and educational interventions can help people with Asperger's syndrome, although all of these may not be necessary in a given individual. The type of interventions chosen must be based upon the individual's age and needs. Types of interventions that have been shown to be of benefit include:""  efforts to reduce overstimulation or overload of sensory input; supporting executive function skills by provision of an environment that is predictable, structured, and organized; organization skills training; speech/language therapy that addresses the ambiguous use of language and the use of language in social settings; social skills training programs, including training in the awareness of social cognition, use of gestures and facial expressions, and conversational language; adaptive skills or life-skills training; educational supports such as assistance with organization, note-taking, allowing oral rather than written testing, use of scripts, and assistance with reading comprehension and subtlety of language use; and self-advocacy training."
What is the prognosis for Asperger's syndrome?,"""An estimation of the prognosis of Asperger's syndrome is difficult, if not impossible, since affected individuals have variable degrees of impairment, and the provision of treatment can dramatically improve the long-term outlook for people with Asperger's syndrome. In general, when social, behavioral, and educational support is provided as needed, people with Asperger's syndrome can be expected to lead happy and productive lives."" "
What are mitochondrial myopathies?,"'Mitochondrial myopathies are a group of neuromuscular diseases caused by damage to the mitochondria—small, energy-producing structures that serve as the cells\' ""power plants."" Nerve cells in the brain and muscles require a great deal of energy, and thus appear to be particularly damaged when mitochondrial dysfunction occurs. Some of the more common mitochondrial myopathies include Kearns-Sayre syndrome, myoclonus ''epilepsy'' with ragged-red fibers, and ''mitochondrial encephalomyopathy'' with lactic acidosis and ''stroke-like episodes''.' "
What are the symptoms of mitochondrial myopathies?,"'The symptoms of mitochondrial myopathies include muscle ''weakness'' or ''exercise'' intolerance, ''heart failure'' or rhythm disturbances, ''dementia'', movement disorders, ''stroke''-like episodes, deafness, ''blindness'', droopy eyelids, limited mobility of the eyes, ''vomiting'', and ''seizures''. The prognosis for these disorders ranges in severity from progressive weakness to death. Most mitochondrial myopathies occur before the age of 20, and often begin with ''exercise'' intolerance or muscle weakness. During physical activity, muscles may become easily fatigued or weak. Muscle cramping is rare, but may occur. ''Nausea'', ''headache'', and breathlessness are also associated with these disorders.'  "
Is there any treatment for mitochondrial disease?,"'Although there is no specific treatment for any of the mitochondrial myopathies, physical therapy may extend the range of movement of muscles and improve dexterity. Vitamin therapies such as riboflavin, coenzyme Q, and carnitine (a specialized amino acid) may provide subjective improvement in ''fatigue'' and energy levels in some patients.'  "
What is the prognosis for mitochondrial disease?,"'The prognosis for patients with mitochondrial myopathies varies greatly, depending largely on the type of disease and the degree of involvement of various organs. These disorders cause progressive weakness and can lead to death.'  "
What research is being done for mitochondrial disease?,"'The NINDS conducts and supports research on mitochondrial myopathies. The goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding of these disorders and to find ways to effectively treat, prevent, or potentially cure them.' "

What is sleep?,"'Physiologically, ''sleep'' is a complex process of restoration and renewal for the body. Scientists still do not have a definitive explanation for why humans have a need for sleep. We do know that sleep is not a passive process or ""switching off"" of body functions; sleep is believed to be important in many physiologic processes including the processing of experiences and the consolidation of memories. It is also clear that sleep is essential, not only for humans but for almost all animals. ''The importance of sleep is underscored by the symptoms experienced by those suffering from sleep problems. People suffering from ''sleep disorders'' do not get adequate or restorative sleep, and sleep deprivation is associated with a number of both physical and emotional disturbances.' "
What causes the body to sleep?,"'Sleep is influenced by the circadian rhythms (regular body changes in mental and physical characteristics that occur in the course of about 24 hours). These are controlled by brain neurons that respond to light, temperature and hormones and other signals and comprise the body\'s biological clock. This clock helps regulate the ""normal"" awake and sleep cycles. Disruption of these cycles can make people sleepy, or somnolent, at times people want to be awake. For example, ''travelers'' experience ""''jet lag''"" when they cross time zones. When a New Yorker arrives in Paris at midnight Paris time, his or her body continues to operate (their biological clock) on New York time. It may take several days to reset a person\'s biologic clock, depending on how much it has been altered by the time change. Different organ systems in the body recover at different rates.''There is evidence that some aspects of sleep are under genetic influence; a gene termed DEC2 is being investigated as causing people that possess it to require only about 6 hours of sleep. Researchers have only begun to examine the genetics involved in sleep.' "
What are the stages of sleep?,"'There are two general states of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. NREM sleep is further subdivided (see below).''Disruptions in the entire sleep cycle or in the individual phases are believed to account for the various types of sleep disorders.' REM sleep (rapid-eye movement): REM sleep is unlike any of the other stages of sleep. It was first described in 1953 when sleep researchers noticed a unique pattern of brain waves (signals recorded on an electroencephalogram (EEG), a type of test that measures the electrical impulses within the brain). These brain waves had a fast frequency and low voltage, similar to the brain waves seen in the normal awake state. Other characteristics of REM sleep include complete inactivity of the voluntary muscles in the body, with the exception of the muscles that control eye movements. Rapid eye movements are also observed during REM sleep. People who are awakened during REM sleep often report that they were dreaming at the time. About 20% to 25% of sleep time is REM sleep; in infants it can comprise about 40%. NREM (non-rapid eye movement): NREM sleep occurs in 3 stages, according to the pattern of brain electrical activity: Stage N1 sleep, or the transition from wakefulness to deeper sleep. This is the lightest stage of sleep, and people may not always perceive they are asleep when in this stage. Stage N2 sleep is a true sleep state, and accounts for 40% to 50% of sleep time. Stage N3 sleep has been called deep sleep, delta sleep, or slow wave sleep. This stage accounts for about 20% of sleep in young adults."
How long does it take to get REM sleep?,"""Sleep typically occurs in cycles that range from 90 to 120 minutes in length, with 4 to 5 cycles occurring during each night's sleep. In the first half of the night, there is a transition from wakefulness into stage N1 sleep, then to stages N2, and N3. Stages N2 and N3 then reappear, followed by the first instance of REM sleep. Cycles of stage N2 and REM sleep alternate with each other for the second half of the night. Typically, there is a greater portion of N sleep in the first half of the night and REM sleep in the later portion of the night."" "
Why is REM sleep important?,"'REM sleep makes up less than 25% of total sleep time, and the reason for its importance is not fully understood. Some studies have suggested that REM sleep is necessary for the brain to preserve memories and maintain appropriate neurological connections.' "
What percentage of sleep should be deep sleep?,"'Deep (N3) sleep, as defined above, only accounts for about 20% of total sleep. The largest amount of deep sleep takes place in the first half of the night.' "
How much sleep does a person need?,"'Individuals vary greatly in their need for sleep; there are no established criteria to determine exactly how much sleep a person needs. Eight hours or more may be necessary for some people, while others may consider this to be too much sleep.''The National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests that most average adults need about 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. ''Newborn'' ''babies'', by contrast, sleep from 16 to 18 hours a day. Preschool-aged children typically sleep between 10 and 12 hours a day. Older, school-aged children and ''teens'' need at least 9 hours of sleep a night. Women in the ''first trimester'' of ''pregnancy'"" have been observed to need a few more hours' sleep than is usual for them."" "
Does the amount of sleep we need change as we age?,"'Changes in the sleep cycle do occur with ''aging''. Deep or slow wave sleep (Stage N3) sleep declines as we age, while light sleep (Stage N1) increases with age, so that older adults may spend less time in the more restorative stages of sleep and more time in lighter sleep. Older people are also more easily aroused from sleep. While some people believe that older adults need less sleep as they get older, there is no scientific evidence that older people need less sleep than younger adults.' "
What are signs and symptoms of sleep deprivation?,"'Feeling tired or drowsy at any time during the day is one symptom of not having enough sleep. Being able to fall asleep within 5 minutes of lying down in the evening also may be a sign a person may be suffering from sleep deprivation. People who suffer from sleep deprivation often experience so-called ""microsleeps,"" which are short bursts of sleep in an otherwise awake person.''Sleep-deprived people perform poorly on tests such as driving simulators and tests of hand-eye coordination. Sleep deprivation can also magnify the effects of ''alcohol'', meaning that a sleep-deprived person will be more susceptible to becoming impaired after alcohol consumption than a well-rested person. ''Caffeine'' and other ''stimulants'' cannot successfully overcome the drowsiness associated with sleep deprivation.'  "
What are and what causes sleep disorders?,"'Sleep disorders are disruptions of the sleep cycle or the quality of sleep. About 50 to 70 million Americans are believed to suffer from chronic sleep disorders, with millions more affected on an occasional basis. Doctors have defined over 70 different types of sleep disorders, but the most common sleep disorders are ''insomnia'', ''sleep apnea'', ''restless legs syndrome'', and ''narcolepsy''.''Other sleep disorders include:'   Insomnia is the perception of poor-quality sleep, including the inability to fall asleep or stay asleep. Because people differ in their need for sleep, there are no fixed criteria that define insomnia. Insomnia is very common and occurs in 30% of the general population. Approximately 10% of the population may suffer from chronic (long-standing) insomnia. Sleep onset insomnia is characterized as occurring at the beginning of the desired sleep time and lasting for greater than 30 minutes. Sleep maintenance insomnia is when individuals fall asleep, but awaken periodically or for lengthy periods during the night, increasing the wake-after-sleep-onset (WASO). Sleep apnea is another common sleep disorder characterized by a reduction or pause of breathing (airflow) during sleep. Central sleep apnea (CSA) occurs when the brain does not send the signal to the muscles to take a breath, and there is no muscular effort to take a breath. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when the brain sends the signal to the muscles and the muscles make an effort to take a breath, but they are unsuccessful because the airway becomes obstructed and prevents an adequate flow of air. Mixed sleep apnea occurs when there is both central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea. Restless leg syndrome (RLS), also known as nocturnal myoclonus, is a type of sleep disorder characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the legs and an uncontrollable desire to move the legs. These abnormal sensations usually occur in the lower legs during the evening. Periodic leg movements (PLMs) are related to RLS, but occur after the onset of sleep and are labeled as a sleep disorder or syndrome when the movements cause increased activity in the brain. During the early stages of sleep, these episodes of leg movement often last up to an hour. The abnormal sensations of RLS are quite variable. They have been described as a crawling, creeping, pulling, drawing, tingling, pins and needles, or prickly discomfort. They are not cramping in character. Patients with RLS may have difficulty falling asleep because of the difficulty getting comfortable and an increased urge to move their legs. Many patients with RLS will have PLMs and vice versa, but they are not the same disorder. Narcolepsy is a disease of the central nervous system that results uniformly in excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Other primary symptoms of narcolepsy include the loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), distorted perceptions (hypnagogic hallucinations), and the inability to move or talk (sleep paralysis). Additional symptoms can include disturbed nocturnal sleep and automatic behaviors (affected persons carry out certain actions without conscious awareness). All of the symptoms of narcolepsy may be present in various combinations and degrees of severity. periodic limb movement disorder hypersomnia sleepwalking snoring REM sleep behavior disorder nightmares, and circadian rhythm disorders, and night shift work sleep disorder"
How are sleep problems diagnosed?,"""Doctors use a number of different tests to evaluate sleep and determine whether a sleep disorder is present. A careful medical history and physical examination are performed to help identify any medical conditions that may be interfering with the person's sleep. The health care practitioner will also ask about the use of prescription and non-prescription medications as well as alcohol, tobacco, and ""'caffeine'' use. Laboratory tests may also be used to help diagnose any medical conditions that may cause sleep problems.''In some cases, specialized testing is recommended to help determine whether or not a person may be suffering from a sleep disorder. Some of the most common sleep tests include the following:' Polysomnography is often simply referred to as a ""sleep study."" Full sleep studies with additional information about the patterns and events during sleep are most commonly performed in specially designed labs in hospitals or clinics. In this test, functions such as airflow, breathing effort, blood oxygen levels, leg movements, electrocardiogram (ECG), and body position may be measured along with electrodes attached to the face and scalp to measure brain waves (electroencephalogram or EEG) and muscle tone during a night's sleep. Newer technologies have allowed the assessment of sleep disordered breathing in a patient's home setting. This type of out-of-lab testing with a portable sleep monitor usually follows a clinical evaluation by a sleep specialist.  The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is designed to measure daytime sleepiness. The test is based upon the fact that the sleepier an individual is, the faster he or she will fall asleep. In this test, the patient is given four to five opportunities to nap in a quiet, dark room, usually at two hour intervals during the day. Body functions such as EEG and muscle tone are measured as in polysomnography. The time period needed from wakefulness to sleep onset is measured to determine the ""sleep latency."" This is repeated during each of the naps, and an average time for sleep latency across all the naps is calculated. Usually a sleep latency of 5 minutes or less is signifies severe daytime sleepiness. Related to the MSLT is the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), which measures the individual's ability to stay awake when reclining in a quiet, darkened room. The Epworth sleepiness scale is a questionnaire that is given to patients, often as part of an office visit to a health care practitioner. The test asks individuals to rate how likely they would be to fall asleep in a number of situations (such as a passenger in a car, sitting quietly after lunch, etc.)."
How are sleep problems treated?,"'The treatment of sleep disorders depends upon the exact disorder and the degree of severity of the symptoms. Both medical and non-medical approaches are generally used in the treatment of sleep disorders. In some cases, such as sleep apnea, surgical treatments may be considered. In some patients, more than one type of sleep disorder may be present, requiring a combination of treatment considerations.'  "
Sleep hygiene,"'Non-medical treatment options are often referred to as sleep hygiene. Sleep hygiene is the practice of behavioral habits that offer the maximum potential for restorative and sound sleep. Good sleep hygiene practices include:' Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol use before bedtime. Some studies have shown that caffeine consumed early in the day can have an effect on the ability to fall asleep at night. Have and adhere to a regular bedtime and waking schedule. Maintain a comfortable sleep environment, including a comfortable temperature. Avoid watching television or using electronics with backlit screens in bed and falling asleep with the TV on in 
	the room. Do not lie in bed awake, worrying about not sleeping (or anything else negative). This produces anxiety that can actually make the problem worse. Get regular daily exercise (it is recommended that individuals avoid exercise two hours prior to bedtime)."
Other therapies,"'Of course, many people with sleep disorders will require treatment beyond sleep hygiene measures. ''Behavioral therapies'' are successful for many people who suffer from insomnia. These therapies may consist of stimulus control measures, such as using the bed for sleeping and sex only and not for other activities such as reading or TV watching. ''Sleep restriction therapies'' are often used to help individuals avoid staying in bed too long and actually over-sleeping after a night of insomnia.' "
Sleep aids (prescription and OTC),"'Medications'' can be of value in treating some types of sleep disorders. However, since sedating medications typically have the potential for ''addiction'' and abuse, their use must be carefully supervised by a health care practitioner. Among the types of prescription ''drugs'' that have been prescribed for specific sleep disorders include:''OTC sleep medications'' are sometimes used for the short-term treatment of insomnia. These include the sedating ''antihistamines'' such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''). However, this is not a recommended use of these or other similar drugs due to their many side effects and the possibility of long-term drowsiness the following day.''Melatonin'', a chemical released from the brain which induces sleep, has been tried in supplement form and promoted as a natural sleep remedy for treatment of insomnia. But studies have shown that it has been generally ineffective in treating common types of insomnia, except in specific situations in patients with known low levels of melatonin.''CPAP'' devices'' (continuous positive airway pressure; a device worn over the face that holds the airway open by maintaining constant air pressure) or AutoPAP (PAP delivered over a range of pressures) and ''dental appliances'' have been effective in the management of sleep-related breathing disorders, including sleep apnea. CPAP is typically the first line of therapy for most adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Surgery can be effective for some patients and may help patients respond to CPAP. Newer, implantable devices that stimulate the muscles of the upper airway during sleep may also be a treatment option for some patients.' Benzodiazepines, such as triazolam (Halcion), temazepam (Restoril), and lorazepam (Ativan) Newer, non-benzodiazepine sedative drugs: zaleplon (Sonata), zolpidem (Ambien or Ambien CR, Zolpimist), and eszopiclone (Lunesta). Ramelteon (Rozerem), an insomnia drug that acts by mimicking the action of melatonin (see below) Suvorexant (Belsomra) is the first in a new class of drugs known as orexin receptor antagonists (ORAs for the treatment of insomnia. Suvorexant works by promoting the natural transition from wakefulness to sleep by inhibiting the wakefulness-promoting orexin neurons of the arousal system. Antidepressant medications have been used to treat insomnia in people who may also suffer from depression. Examples are trazodone (Desyrel), amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep), and doxepin (Sinequan, Adapin). A number of prescription drugs have been used to treat restless legs syndrome, including carbidopa-levodopa, opioids (such as propoxyphene [Darvon, Darvon-N, Dolene]) or tramadol (Ultram) for intermittent symptoms, carbamazepine (Tegretol, Tegretol XR , Equetro, Carbatrol),clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium, Diastat), triazolam (Halcion), temazepam (Restoril), baclofen, bromocriptine, clonidine (Catapres, Catapres-TTS, Jenloga), gabapentin (Neurontin), ropinirole (Requip) and pramipexole (Mirapex). In sleep apnea and other sleep disorders in which airway obstruction is a problem, topical nasal decongestants may provide some relief. However, many clinicians warn people with sleep apnea never to use sleeping pills or medications that are sedative as the person could be prevented from waking enough to stimulate breathing, which could lead to brain damage or sudden death."
Are sleep problems and disease related?,"'Sleep problems occur in a number of different medical and psychiatric conditions. For example, ''asthma'' attacks and ''stroke'' are conditions that tend to occur frequently during the night or early morning hours. The relationship between sleep stages and certain types of epileptic ''seizures'' is complex and not completely understood, but certain sleep stages tend to either exacerbate or prevent the spread of ''seizure'' activity in the brain. ''Sleep problems occur with ''chronic pain'' and conditions in which ''pain'' is worse at night, because the ''pain'"" may interfere with sleep. Pain medications and other types of medications taken on a regular basis for chronic conditions can also have an effect on an individual's sleep pattern. Those suffering from ""'cancer'', '""Alzheimer's""' disease, and ''brain injury'' are also commonly affected by sleep disturbances.''Psychiatric diseases such as ''depression'' are also associated with sleep problems. This condition can be associated with both too much sleep and too little sleep. In fact, sleep problems are associated with a majority of mental disorders, and poor quality or insufficient sleep can worsen the symptoms of mental or psychiatric conditions.' "
How can I get a good night's sleep?,"'Practicing good sleep hygiene (see above), including maintenance of a regular bedtime and awakening schedule, is the best way to ensure restful and restorative sleep. Avoidance of caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and strenuous exercise in the hours prior to bedtime can also help improve the quality of your sleep. Many people report that they lie awake at night worrying about problems or situations they will face during the coming day. In this case, it can be helpful to write a to-do list or a list of items to act upon the following day prior to bedtime, giving yourself permission to ""let go"" of these items during the night. ''If you are concerned about the quality of your sleep or if you have the symptoms of a sleep disorder, it is important to consult your health care practitioner. He or she can help you determine the cause of your sleep problem and recommend appropriate therapy.' "
How much sleep do children need?,"'Just as with adults, the amount of ''sleep'' children need varies with both age and unique needs of the individual. Below are general guidelines for children of various ages. If your child is happy and thriving, but needs more or fewer hours of ''sleep'"" than indicated below - rest assured they will remain healthy. The National Sleep Foundation's 2015 Guidelines recommend the following for sleep in children and ""'teens''.'  1 to 4 weeks old: Neonates spend approximately 65% to 75% of their daily activity in a sleep state. Waking time is of short duration and it is rare for a child of this age to have a ""day-night"" cycle. Their day-night ""clock"" is not functional until 6 to 8 weeks of age. Mothers of newborns should use their infant's sleep pattern to sleep also. 1 to 4 months old: Infants at this early age require sleep 14 to 17 hours 
of sleep per day. Many begin to develop a day-night cycle during the early weeks of this period. 
At this age, many infants have the ability to sleep evening blocks of 5 to 6 hours without interruption; however most will wake for feedings or diaper changes during the night. 4 to 12 months old: Infants in this age range require 12 to 15 hours of sleep daily. Good news for parents 
- they begin to sleep for longer continuous periods at night. Also, early in this time period, many children benefit from multiple daytime naps, though there is significant variability between different infants.  1 to 3 years old: While specialists point out that most toddlers need about 12 to 14 hours of daily sleep, many may be forced to survive on less. Daycare and erratically spaced car trips necessary for the needs of older siblings often deny or disrupt continuous sleep patterns, most often naps. 3 to 6 years old: This age range commonly needs approximately 10 to 13 hours of sleep per day with younger individuals taking a nap after lunch. Any need for napping is generally absent by the time a child enters 1st grade. 7 to 12 years old: Younger children in this age range commonly require 
9 to 11 hours of sleep each night; pre-teens often receive 9 to 10 hours (though some may require more). 12 to 18 years old: Middle and high school student lifestyle requirements (school, after school activities, dinner and finally homework) often reduce the sleep duration from the recommended 8 to 
10 hours to 6 to 8 hours. The various social network computer websites coupled with cell phone text communication 
and television viewing also may cut into a teenager's sleep time."
Can a lack of sleep impact a child's behavior?,"'The symptoms of a lack of sleep are often obvious to watchful parents. Some of these tell-tale signs include: ' recurrently falling asleep in the car (excluding young infants); requiring extreme stimulation and repetitive reminders to get up in the morning;  behavioral abnormalities such as excessive emotionalism, aggression, and crankiness; and  an older child's (over 8 years of age) recurrent need for an afternoon nap."
What is sleep hygiene?,"'A common definition of sleep hygiene is'' '' ""all behavioral and environmental factors that precede sleep and may interfere with sleep."" Daytime sleepiness and trouble sleeping may be a reflection of poor sleep hygiene. Detailed specifics are listed below. General areas to consider include: ' Personal habits: Establish consistent routines around bedtimes and awakening times  Sleep environment: The bedroom should be a slightly cooler temperature 
(between 60 F to 67 F or 15.5 C to 19.4 C), and eliminate any distracting noise in the bedroom Getting ready for bed: Establish a calming pre-sleep ritual (for example, reading, not watching TV) and  Miscellaneous: Examples include limiting intake of foods/liquids/medications which may disrupt a restful sleep"
What are some common sleep disorders in children?,"""The University of Michigan's ""'Sleep Disorders'' program includes five issues that may be disruptive of good sleep practices. These include: ' Sleep deprivation: As noted in the previously, the amount of sleep generally required varies with age and genetic predisposition. Unfortunately many older children, especially teens, do not receive an appropriate amount of sound sleep. Night waking: All children after the first 7 to 8 months of life start to be more sensitive to internal and external stimuli. If an infant has not yet learned to calm himself and resettle back to sleep, the parents commonly are summoned to help the child return to sleep. This pattern may repeat itself several times each night. Separation anxiety: Children experience this emotion commonly at 5 months of age as well as during the toddler years. Such children become anxious and are unable to enter a comfortable sleep pattern unless parents are present.  Resistance to sleep/settling problems: This occurs when your child does not want to go to bed at a reasonable time. Stalling, temper tantrums, and other resistance patterns are common. Parental persistence generally will resolve this common issue. Parasomnias: Parasomnias are problems that disrupt sleep. Examples include night terrors, grinding of teeth, sleepwalking, etc."
Sleep Apnea symptoms in children,"'Sleep apnea'' is an extremely serious sleep pathology in which the child will struggle to breath and possibly stop ''breathing'"". This process most commonly is a consequence of an enlarged tonsil and adenoid tissues that obstruct the child's upper ""'airway'"". Parents of such children will report that it sounds as if their child is being choked during sleep. Complications of sleep apnea include reduced oxygen to the brain and strain of the right side of the heart. If you believe your child may have sleep apnea, you should discuss your concerns with your child's pediatrician. An evaluation by and ENT (ears-nose-throat) specialist is often indicated. It is helpful to either audio/video record such an episode prior to such an evaluation."" "
Parasomnia symptoms in children,"'Parasomnias are disruptive sleep related events. They include several infrequent events (''periodic limb movement disorder'', ''restless leg syndrome'') and more common events (''teeth grinding'', night terrors, and ''nightmares'', sleepwalking, and ''bedwetting''). Periodic limb movement disorder occurs while asleep and is characterized by repetitive leg and (occasionally) arm movement that persist throughout the night. The child or teenager does not complain of any discomfort or abnormal sensations. In contrast, ''restless leg syndrome'' occurs while awake and affected individuals often describe a sensation of their legs ""falling asleep.""''Nightmares occur during REM (dreaming period) sleep and thus are more common later in the night. The child acts scared but may be comforted by their parents. Such children will often be able to remember their dream. Simple parental reassurance and comforting is effective. In contrast, night terrors occur in non-''REM sleep'' and thus generally within the first 4 hours of sleep. The child may become very violent with crying out in a confused manner as well as thrashing of arms and legs. Routine comforting of the child is not helpful and the child will be confused and bewildered if awakened. Generally, the child will rapidly return to a ""normal"" sleep with no memory of the events in the morning.' "
Confusional arousal symptoms in children,"'Confusional arousals are a variant of night terrors in older infants and toddlers that occur during the first half of the nighttime sleep sequence. It is felt that the child is so deeply asleep and the normal waking pattern at the end of the sleep cycle is suppressed. ''The major distinguishing point of confusional arousals versus night terrors is that the former gradually build from moaning, to crying out, and may culminate in the child standing and yelling out apparent random words or phrases. ''Conversely, night terrors tend to have an acute onset with the very rapid development of thrashing and yelling (commonly for the parents or caregivers). Confusional arousal and night terrors share several key points important for the child:' Don't try to awaken the child. They are asleep and if awakened, will have difficult time falling back to sleep. Anything that upsets the normal sleep rhythms (illness, not sleeping in their own home, and disrupted naps) may trigger either pattern."
Night terror symptoms in children,"'Night terrors are somewhat rare events that have their highest frequency in children 4 to 12 years of age. They are commonly outgrown by adulthood, though some adults manifest the same brain ''EEG'' (""brain wave"") changes during sleepwalking. ''Night terrors differ from nightmares (see previously). Night terrors manifest themselves with the person bolting upright in bed, screaming and thrashing about and stare blankly at the concerned adult who has come to investigate. They tend to occur during the first third of the child\'s sleep cycle. Children characteristically do not ""calm down"" when their parent attempts to soothe what appears to be a fearful experience. EEG studies demonstrate that the child is not awake (i.e. he/she is asleep), and if awakened, has no knowledge or memory of the immediately preceding events. The duration of night terror episodes is short lived. Some authorities believe that night terrors may be a response to sleep deprivation, ''stress'', ''fever'', or ''fatigue''.' "
Narcolepsy symptoms in children,"'Narcolepsy'' is more common in adults than children. It has been defined as ""a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep. Narcolepsy is a chronic condition for which there is no cure."" Research has shown that narcolepsy is not a type of ''seizure'', ''fainting'' episode, or psychological illness. Symptoms of narcolepsy include:' Excessive daytime sleepiness: affected individuals have an uncontrollable need to sleep during the day; Sudden loss of muscle tone (Cataplexy): this may range from slurred speech to total collapse of all voluntary muscles. Emotional stimulation (often positive by nature, for example, laughter) may trigger such an attack; Sleep paralysis: Characterized by a temporary (1-2 minutes) period of the inability to speak or move when falling asleep or waking; Vivid or frightening hallucinations which occur most commonly during REM (dreaming) sleep."
Sleepwalking symptoms in children,"'The onset of sleepwalking (somnambulism) typically presents in prepubertal children most frequently at age 11 to 12, and occurs more often in boys than girls. The overall incidence of sleepwalking is approximately 18%. Like night terrors, the individual is difficult to arouse during the event and does not remember the experience. Sleepwalking most commonly occurs during the first third of the sleep cycle. Some sleepwalkers may also mumble during sleepwalking episodes and occasionally obscene words may be uttered. Medications are rarely necessary to manage sleepwalking episodes. Ensuring a safe environment (protection against falls or ''walking'' out of the house) and maintenance of good sleep habits (avoiding sleep deprivation) are important considerations to prevent sleepwalking.' "
Do teenagers have the same sleep requirements as younger children?,"'Most teens need about 8 to 10 hours of sleep per day. Some studies have indicated that they have a different internal ""sleep clock"" than those younger or older than them. Researchers have demonstrated that teens are truly ""night owls,"" and if left to their own devices, would spontaneously wake from a good night\'s sleep anywhere from 9:00 am to 10:00 am. High school teachers who have classes before this time period have empiric experience to second this observation. Younger children may need anywhere from 12-15 hours (infant: 2 naps plus nighttime long block) to 9-11 hours (middle school child). ' "
How can I teach my child or teenager healthy sleep habits and good sleep hygiene?,"'Primary to establishing good sleep habits is a realization that sleep is a normal and necessary function. However, just as with other normal and necessary functions (for example, eating, toilet training, etc.), a battle may develop between parents and their child in this area. ''All children older than 5 to 6 months of age need to master the ability to self-soothe and relax in order to successfully fall asleep. Depriving them of this skill by either feeding or rocking them to sleep, reading until the child falls asleep, or lying down with the child in order to facilitate falling asleep, is a recipe for frustration - both for the child and the parent. ''Tired children (of any age) intuitively know when they are tired and, if provided the proper environment, will easily and quickly fall asleep. ''When they awaken during the middle of the night they are capable of falling back to sleep without parental intervention. In this circumstance, both child and parents awake refreshed the next morning.' "
What are some ways I can help my child or teenager get a better night's sleep?,"'These ""do\'s"" are adapted from ""''Sleep Problems'': Your Child"" University of Michigan Health Care System and ""Healthy Sleep Tips"" from the National Sleep Foundation.'  Make bedtime a special time. Create special soothing and calming experiences with the opportunity for special ""talks"" or sharing experiences that foster comfort for both child and parent. Study your child so you can determine when he is ready to sleep. Once this is determined you can start the ""get ready for bed"" routine with enough time in advance so the child doesn't get a ""second wind"". Keep the bedtime routine consistent and simple. Mental and physical stimulation is counter productive. Dim lights starting about 10 – 15 minutes before going to sleep.  Bright lights act as a stimulant to the child's brain.   Keep the bedtime routine portable. For example, it can occur whether at home or outside of the home (for example, in a motel during vacation). Make sure your child is both mentally and physically tired at the end of the day. Children need between 30 to 60 minutes per day of vigorous playtime (depending on the age). Besides fostering good sleep habits, such a program will help maintain optimum weight gain. Establish a restful atmosphere. Keep the lights dim, limit noise and electronic devices. Teens should turn off computers/TV's and cell phones when retiring to bed. 
The bedroom temperature should be between 60 F and 67 F or 15.5 C to 19.4 C. Avoid afternoon naps in children over 6 years of age."
"What are some ""don'ts"" for getting my child or teen to sleep?","'These ""don\'ts"" are adapted from ""Sleep Problems: Your Child"" University of Michigan Health Care System.' Don't put your child to bed with a bottle of juice, milk or formula. Sugar in such drinks promotes tooth decay. Water is acceptable. Don't fill up the bed with toys. Limit the crib/bed to one to two ""special"" items. Too many items are over stimulating and the child will have a hard time not playing with them. Eliminate any object that might be a safety hazard. Don't threaten to send your child to bed as a punishment. Bedtime should be an enjoyable experience that will promote falling asleep in a timely fashion. Avoid caffeine before bed: Caffeinated drinks such as cola, chocolate, iced tea, 
energy drinks, etc. Limit TV in the afternoon and at night. TV stimulation may carry on longer than you suspect. Having a TV in a child's room may be counterproductive to getting your child or teen to sleep. A 2014 National Sleep Foundation study indicates that 72% of children 6 years old to 17 years old have at least one electronic device in their bedroom.  These children may get up to one hour less sleep per night as their peers without such devices in the bedroom."
How much sleep do children need?,"'Just as with adults, the amount of ''sleep'' children need varies with both age and unique needs of the individual. Below are general guidelines for children of various ages. If your child is happy and thriving, but needs more or fewer hours of ''sleep'"" than indicated below - rest assured they will remain healthy. The National Sleep Foundation's 2015 Guidelines recommend the following for sleep in children and ""'teens''.'  1 to 4 weeks old: Neonates spend approximately 65% to 75% of their daily activity in a sleep state. Waking time is of short duration and it is rare for a child of this age to have a ""day-night"" cycle. Their day-night ""clock"" is not functional until 6 to 8 weeks of age. Mothers of newborns should use their infant's sleep pattern to sleep also. 1 to 4 months old: Infants at this early age require sleep 14 to 17 hours 
of sleep per day. Many begin to develop a day-night cycle during the early weeks of this period. 
At this age, many infants have the ability to sleep evening blocks of 5 to 6 hours without interruption; however most will wake for feedings or diaper changes during the night. 4 to 12 months old: Infants in this age range require 12 to 15 hours of sleep daily. Good news for parents 
- they begin to sleep for longer continuous periods at night. Also, early in this time period, many children benefit from multiple daytime naps, though there is significant variability between different infants.  1 to 3 years old: While specialists point out that most toddlers need about 12 to 14 hours of daily sleep, many may be forced to survive on less. Daycare and erratically spaced car trips necessary for the needs of older siblings often deny or disrupt continuous sleep patterns, most often naps. 3 to 6 years old: This age range commonly needs approximately 10 to 13 hours of sleep per day with younger individuals taking a nap after lunch. Any need for napping is generally absent by the time a child enters 1st grade. 7 to 12 years old: Younger children in this age range commonly require 
9 to 11 hours of sleep each night; pre-teens often receive 9 to 10 hours (though some may require more). 12 to 18 years old: Middle and high school student lifestyle requirements (school, after school activities, dinner and finally homework) often reduce the sleep duration from the recommended 8 to 
10 hours to 6 to 8 hours. The various social network computer websites coupled with cell phone text communication 
and television viewing also may cut into a teenager's sleep time."
Can a lack of sleep impact a child's behavior?,"'The symptoms of a lack of sleep are often obvious to watchful parents. Some of these tell-tale signs include: ' recurrently falling asleep in the car (excluding young infants); requiring extreme stimulation and repetitive reminders to get up in the morning;  behavioral abnormalities such as excessive emotionalism, aggression, and crankiness; and  an older child's (over 8 years of age) recurrent need for an afternoon nap."
What is sleep hygiene?,"'A common definition of sleep hygiene is'' '' ""all behavioral and environmental factors that precede sleep and may interfere with sleep."" Daytime sleepiness and trouble sleeping may be a reflection of poor sleep hygiene. Detailed specifics are listed below. General areas to consider include: ' Personal habits: Establish consistent routines around bedtimes and awakening times  Sleep environment: The bedroom should be a slightly cooler temperature

Introduction to aortic dissection,"'The aorta is the large blood vessel that leads from the ''heart'' and carries blood to the rest of the body. It originates at the ''aortic valve'' at the outlet of the ''left ventricle'' of the heart and ascends within the chest to an arch where blood vessels branch off to supply blood flow to the arms and head. The aorta then begins to descend through the chest and into the abdomen where it splits into two iliac arteries that provide blood flow to the legs. Along its descent, more small arteries branch out to supply blood to the stomach, intestine, colon, kidneys, and the spinal cord. Also, at its origin at the aortic valve, coronary arteries branch from the aorta to supply the heart muscle with blood.''The aorta has a thick wall with three layers of tissue that allow the blood vessel to withstand the high pressure that is generated when the heart pumps blood to the body. The three layers are the tunica intima, tunica media, and the tunic adventitia. The intima is the inside layer that is in contact with the blood, the media is in the middle, and the adventitia is the outermost layer.''In an aortic dissection, a small tear occurs in the tunica intima (the inside layer of the aortic wall in contact with blood). Blood can enter this tear and cause the intima layer to strip away from the media layer, in effect dividing the tissue layers of the aortic wall and forming a false channel, or lumen. This channel may be short or may extend the full length of the aorta. Another tear more distal (further along the course of the aorta than the initial tear) in the intima layer can let blood re-enter the true lumen of the aorta.''In some cases, the dissection will cross all three layers of the aortic wall and cause immediate rupture and almost certain death. In most other cases, the blood is contained between the wall layers, usually causing ''pain'' felt in the back or flanks.''While there have been different historic classifications of aortic dissection, the Stanford classification is now most commonly used.''A patient can have a type A dissection, type B dissection, or a combination of both.''Some patients may experience an aortic dissection without ''pain'' and it may be found incidentally on imaging studies performed for other purposes.'   Type A dissections involve the ascending aorta and arch. Type B involves the descending aorta."
What are the causes of aortic dissection?,"'\tIt is uncertain as to why the initial tear (rent) occurs in the intima layer of the aortic wall. Aortic dissection tends to occur most commonly in men between the ages of 50 and 70.''''High blood pressure'':'' Most cases are associated with ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''). The aorta has to withstand significant pressure changes with each heartbeat, and it may be that over time with ''hypertension'', a weakening of an area of the intima will occur.''\tSome conditions increase the risk of aortic dissection or are associated with the condition, including:''''Pregnancy'':'' Pregnancy is a rare associated risk factor, especially in the ''third trimester'' and early in the postpartum period.''''Trauma'':'"" Blunt trauma is known to cause aortic dissection, which is often seen after car wrecks in which the patient's chest hits the steering wheel.""'''Surgical complications:'' Aortic dissection can be a complication of medical operations including ''coronary artery bypass'' grafting and aortic and ''mitral valve'' repairs. It can also be a complication of heart catheterization.'

Cocaine use"
What are the signs and symptoms of aortic dissection?,"   Pain is the most common symptom of aortic dissection and is often described as tearing or ripping and often begins suddenly. If the aortic dissection occurs in the chest, the pain is usually centered in the chest and radiates directly into the upper back. If the dissection occurs in the abdominal aorta, the pain may occur in the mid back or low back and radiate to the flanks. There may be associated nausea, sweating, shortness of breath, and weakness. The patient may pass out (syncope). Other symptoms may be related to the location of the dissection within the aorta and whether it affects some of the branch arteries and occludes their blood supply. For example, if an artery that supplies blood to the brain is involved, there may be signs of stroke. Or if the dissection affects the anterior spinal artery and blood supply to the spinal cord, the patient may present with paraplegia.  The coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart begin at the origin of the aorta at the aortic valve. If the coronary arteries are involved, the aortic dissection may cause a heart attack (myocardial infarction) as its presenting symptom. The patient may present with congestive heart failure with fluid building up in the lungs. If the aortic dissection involves the aortic valve and causes it to fail, blood flows back into the heart with each beat and causes blood flow to back up into the lungs.  The pain of aortic dissection can be confused with that of heart attack, but can sometimes be distinguished because of its sudden onset, potentially normal electrocardiogram, and abnormal findings on chest X-ray. The pain of an abdominal aortic dissection can be confused with the pain caused by a kidney stone. The diagnosis is made when a CT scan looking for the kidney stone reveals an aneurysm instead.
 The patient may also have a sense of impending doom."
How is aortic dissection diagnosed?,"'The health care professional should always be suspicious of aortic dissection as one of the three major causes of ''chest pain'' that can cause death, in addition to heart attack and ''pulmonary embolism''.''If the patient has unstable vital signs, poor ''breathing'', abnormal pulse, ''low blood pressure'', and/or a decreased level of consciousness, the ABCs of resuscitation (''Airway'', Breathing, Circulation) need to be addressed while the evaluation of the patient continues. ''Patient History''The history is one of the important first steps in trying to make the diagnosis. It is important to consider not only the symptoms but also the risk factors of high ''blood pressure'', genetic or family history, and the presence of other medical conditions that may predispose the patient to aortic dissection.''Physical examination may show potential complications of the ''aortic aneurysm'' and allow the health care professional to consider this as a potential diagnosis. Again, the presenting symptoms will depend upon the location of the dissection and what organs are involved. Symptoms, depending on the location of the dissection, may include:''The initial tests for ''chest pain'', an electrocardiogram and a chest X-ray, are usually done. Unless the dissection involves the coronary arteries, the electrocardiogram is usually normal. The chest X-ray may show an abnormal shape to the aorta and a widened mediastinum (that space where the heart, aorta, vena cava, trachea, and ''esophagus'' sit in the chest ''cavity'').''The diagnostic test of choice is an aortic ''angiogram'' using ''computerized tomography'' of the chest and abdomen. This test requires a contrast dye injection and visualizes the aorta and other blood vessels that branch off from it. Alternatively, for those people who cannot undergo computerized tomography, transesophageal ''echocardiography'' is an option. A cardiologist puts an ''ultrasound'' probe through the mouth into the esophagus and can identify potential problems with the heart, heart valves, and the aorta.''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') can also be used, but is not often technically easily available with unstable patients and takes much longer to perform than a CT scan.'   Blood pressure discrepancy between the arms Pulse delay between arms and legs Listening for fluid in the lung or for a new heart murmur that may help assess the aortic valve  New stroke symptoms  Paraplegia"
What is the treatment for aortic dissection?,"'The ABCs of resuscitation are always a priority.''In the emergency department, intravenous lines will be placed, monitors for heart rate and rhythm will be attached, and supplemental oxygen will be provided. Treatment and diagnostic testing usually occur at the same time until the final diagnosis is established and definitive treatment is required.''The initial medications used for treatment of an aortic dissection are directed at lowering the blood pressure to prevent further tearing or damage to the aorta. Beta blocker medications (for example, esmolol [Brevibloc], ''labetalol'' [''Normodyne'', ''Trandate''], ''metoprolol'' [''Lopressor'', ''Toprol XL'']) decrease the adrenaline action on the heart and blood vessels. ''Nitroglycerin'' dilates blood vessels to decrease blood pressure. These medications cannot be used if the patient is in ''shock'' with ''low blood pressure'"" because of the aortic dissection. Specific medication combinations will depend upon the patient's needs.""'Ultimately, type A aortic dissections of the ascending aorta require surgery as the treatment of choice. The area of the aorta that is damaged is replaced with an artificial graft. If the aortic valve has been damaged, it too may need replacement or repair.''Medical management (nonsurgical) is usually preferred for type B dissection of the descending aorta, but again, each patient needs to be assessed individually as to the specific treatment suggested. Medications are prescribed to aggressively control high blood pressure to prevent further dissection and aortic injury.'  "
What is the prognosis for aortic dissection?,"'For aortic rupture, in which all three layers of the aorta are disrupted, the mortality (death) rate is up to 80% of patients. Forty percent of these patients die before reaching a hospital.''For type A aortic dissection, the mortality rate remains high, with up to a 30% death rate after surgery.''Type B aortic dissections, treated medically, have an initial death rate of 10%. This compares to a 25% mortality when treated surgically.''Overall, for both types of aortic dissection, the 10-year survival rate is more than 60%.' "
Can aortic dissection be prevented?,"'As with any disease involving blood vessels, prevention is key. Controlling high blood pressure, ''diabetes'', cholesterol, and avoiding ''smoking'' decreases the risk of all blood vessel disease. Because the majority of patients with aortic dissection have ''hypertension'', controlling high blood pressure (one risk factor) may decrease the risk of this disease.''The use of screening ultrasound to look for ''abdominal aortic aneurysm'"" is somewhat controversial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends a one-time ultrasound screening for males aged 65 to 75 who have ever smoked. There is no recommendation for men who don't smoke. They recommend against screening for women because of the rarity of abdominal aortic ""'aneurysm'' in women.''Any chest pain should not be ignored and medical care should be accessed immediately by activating the emergency medical services system and calling 9-1-1.''Since the cause of the chest pain may be unknown, giving a baby ''aspirin'' to the patient is appropriate, as is providing nitroglycerin (if the patient has been prescribed this medication for chest pain).' "
What is dissociative identity disorder?,"'Dissociative identity disorder (DID), formerly called multiple personality disorder (in previous diagnostic manuals, like the ''DSM-IV''), is a ''mental illness'' that involves the sufferer experiencing at least two clear identities or personality states, also called alters, each of which has a fairly consistent way of viewing and relating to the world. Some individuals with DID have been found to have alternate personalities that have distinctly different ways of reacting, in terms of emotions, pulse, ''blood pressure'', and even blood flow to the brain. Health care professionals used to call the disorder multiple personality disorder (MPD), and people often colloquially referred to it as split personality disorder.''Statistics regarding this disorder indicate that the incidence of DID is about 1% of all adults (general population) in the United States, from 1%-20% of patients in psychiatric hospitals and is described as occurring in girls equally to boys and up to nine times more often in women compared to men. However, this female preponderance may be due to difficulty identifying the disorder in males. Disagreement among mental health professionals about how this illness appears clinically and controversy about whether DID even exists adds to the difficulty of estimating how often it occurs.''Some professionals continue to be of the opinion that DID does not exist. The nature of this skepticism is sometimes due to questions about why many more individuals who have endured the ''stress'' of terrible abuse as young children do not develop the disorder, why more children are not diagnosed as having DID, and why some DID sufferers have no history of significant ''trauma''. One explanation for what some believe to be these inconsistencies is that given the highly complex and unknown nature of the human brain and psyche, many of those whom one would expect to develop dissociative identity disorder are spared due to their resilience. Another concern about the diagnosis of DID involves having to rely on the traumatic memories of those who suffer from this disorder. That DID is significantly more often assessed in individuals in North America compared to the rest of the world, for the most part, leads some practitioners to believe that DID is a culture-based concoction rather than a true condition. As with many other mental health issues, symptoms of the same disorder in children look very different from symptoms in adults. Studies that verify the presence of DID using multiple resources add credibility to the diagnosis. Research on individuals with DID that have little to no media exposure to information on the illness lends further credibility to the reliability of the existence of this mental health condition.''Although there was a case study of DID as early as 1906, movies about DID first became well known in the United States in the 1950s. The 1953 movie ''The Three Faces of Eve'' tells the story of Chris Sizemore, a real-life woman with the disorder. She was thought to develop DID in reaction to witnessing several terrible accidents at a young age. That movie described three personalities that a health care professional successfully merged or integrated into one within one year. More accurately, the person depicted in that movie reportedly had to contend with 22 personalities that took more than 45 years to be able to coexist in a functional way. A television miniseries about DID was ''Sybil''. The character of Sybil Dorsett portrayed the life story of Shirley Ardell Mason, who experienced severe physical, emotional, and sexual abuse inflicted by her mother. Physicians thought she developed 16 distinct identities. As with the diagnosis in general, the veracity of the story of Sybil remains a controversy, with claims that the illness in general, and Sybil specifically, is a hoax.' "
What are causes and risk factors of dissociative identity disorder?,"'While there is no proven specific cause of DID, the prevailing psychological theory about how the condition usually develops is as a reaction to severe childhood trauma. Specifically, it is thought that one way that some individuals respond to being severely traumatized as a young child is to wall off altered states of consciousness, in other words to dissociate, those memories. When that reaction becomes extreme, DID may be the result. As with other mental disorders, having a family member with DID may be a risk factor, in that it indicates a potential vulnerability to developing the disorder but does not translate into the condition being literally hereditary.'  "
What are dissociative identity disorder symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms of dissociative identity disorder include'   lapses in memory (dissociation), particularly of significant life events, like birthdays, weddings, or birth of a child; experiencing blackouts in time, resulting in finding oneself in places but not recalling how one got there; being frequently accused of lying when they do not believe they are lying (for example, being told of things they did but do not remember, not related to the influence of any drug or medical condition); finding items in one's possession but not recalling how those things were acquired; encountering people with whom one is unfamiliar but who seem to know them sometimes by another identity; being called names that are completely unlike their own name or nickname; finding items they have clearly written but are in handwriting other than their own; hearing voices inside their head that are not their own; not recognizing themselves in the mirror; feeling unreal (derealization); feeling detached from oneself, like they are watching themselves move through life rather than living their own life (depersonalization); feeling like more than one person."
How do health care professionals diagnose dissociative identity disorder?,"'There is no specific definitive test, like a blood test, that can accurately assess that a person has dissociative identity disorder. Therefore, mental health practitioners like psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, or clinical psychologists conduct a mental health interview that gathers information, looking for the presence of the signs and symptoms previously described. Using structured interviews like the Structured Clinical Interview for Dissociative Disorders (SCID-D) is thought to be particularly helpful in distinguishing DID from other mental illnesses.''The diagnostic criteria described in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5'') for dissociative identity disorder are as follows:'""Professionals usually gather information about the individual's childhood and ask questions to explore whether the symptoms that the client is suffering from are not better accounted for by another mental health condition, dissociative or otherwise. Other types of dissociative disorders include depersonalization/derealization disorder (feeling detached from themselves or surroundings), dissociative ""'amnesia'' (memory problems associated with a traumatic experience), other dissociative disorder (episodes of dissociation that do not qualify for one of the specific dissociative disorders just described but the professional determining the diagnosis describes the reason why the criteria for a specific dissociative disorder is not met, as in when a person is in a trance), and unspecified dissociative disorder, formerly called dissociative disorder, not otherwise specified (DD,NOS), which is characterized by episodes of dissociation that do not qualify for one of the specific dissociative disorders just described). As part of the assessment, mental health professionals also usually ask about other mental conditions and ensure that the person has recently received a comprehensive physical examination and any appropriate medical tests so that any physical conditions that may mimic symptoms of DID are identified and addressed.''Dissociation, a major symptom of DID, occurs in a number of other mental illnesses. For example, an individual with this disorder may seek to relieve overwhelming trauma-related memories by engaging in the self-mutilation and other forms of self-harm/self-injurious and self-destructive behaviors found in those with ''borderline personality disorder''. Also, feelings and behaviors that may appear to be caused by dissociation, but are not, make it all the more difficult to distinguish DID from other conditions. Somatic symptom disorder, conversion disorder, and ''schizophrenia'' are just a few such disorders. ''Rape'' and other adult trauma victims are quite vulnerable to developing dissociative symptoms. The controversy about whether DID exists, as well as the overlap of symptoms it has with a number of other conditions, sometimes results in misdiagnosis.''Symptoms of some other mental disorders may be mistaken for dissociation. The apparent ''impulsivity'' of ''bipolar disorder'' or wide ''mood swings'' associated with ''bipolar disorder'', ''borderline personality disorder'', or ''narcissistic personality disorder'' when triggered by minor slights are examples. People may also confuse the unstable self-image of borderline personality disorder with dissociation. Blackouts related to substance use disorders (formerly described as ''substance abuse'' or dependence) are other instances of an individual being unaware of his or her surroundings that mimic dissociation.''DID often co-occurs with other emotional conditions, including ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), borderline personality disorder (''BPD'""), and a number of other personality disorders, as well as conversion disorder. DID is sometimes feigned by individuals who may be seeking attention, as in Munchausen's syndrome. It has also been appropriately diagnosed as well as feigned in individuals involved in the criminal justice and civil or family court systems (for example, forensic cases). Adding to the diagnostic difficulty is that people like pedophiles and other sex offenders, as well as people with ""'antisocial personality disorder'', may legally stand to gain from having DID. While some of those individuals may feign the diagnosis in an effort to benefit legally, others genuinely suffer from significant dissociative symptoms, as well as full-blown DID. In cases where there may be an ulterior motive for being diagnosed with DID, studies show that using a screening test or structured interview may be the best way to determine if the person truly suffers from this condition.' The presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states (each with its own relatively persistent pattern of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about him or herself and the world) At least two of the identities or personality states repeatedly take control of the person's behavior. An inability to recall important personal information that is too severe to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness The illness is not the result of the direct physiological effects of a substance (for example, blackouts or other abnormal behavior during alcohol or other drug intoxication) or a general medical condition (for example, seizures). In children, imaginary playmates or other fantasy play do not cause the symptoms."
What are the treatment methods for dissociative identity disorder?,"'Psychotherapy is generally considered the main component of treatment for dissociative identity disorder. In treating individuals with DID, therapists usually use individual, family, and/or group psychotherapy to help clients improve their relationships with others and to experience feelings they have not felt comfortable being in touch with or openly expressing in the past. It is carefully paced in order to prevent the person with DID from becoming overwhelmed by ''anxiety'', risking a figurative repetition of their traumatic past being inflicted by those very strong emotions. Dialectical ''behavior therapy'' is a form of cognitive behavior therapy that emphasizes mindfulness and works on helping the DID sufferer soothe him- or herself by decreasing negative responses to stressors.''Mental health professionals also often guide clients in finding a way to have each aspect of them coexist, and work together, as well as developing crisis-''prevention'' techniques and finding ways of coping with memory lapses that occur during times of dissociation. The goal of achieving a more peaceful coexistence of the person\'s multiple personalities is quite different from the reintegration of all those aspects into just one identity state. While reintegration used to be the goal of psychotherapy, it has frequently been found to leave individuals with DID feeling as if the goal of the practitioner is to get rid of, or ""kill,"" parts of them.'""Hypnosis sometimes helps increase the information that the person with DID has about their symptoms/identity states, thereby increasing the control they have over those states when they change from one personality state to another. This occurs by enhancing the communication that each aspect of the person's identity has with the others. In this age of insurance companies regulating the health care that most Americans receive, having time-limited, multiple periods of psychotherapy rather than intensive long-term care provides what may be another effective treatment option for helping people who are living with DID.""""Physicians increasingly use eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), a type of treatment that integrates traumatic memories with the patient's own resources, in the treatment of people with dissociative identity disorder. It results in enhanced information processing and healing.""'Medications are often used to address the many other mental health conditions that individuals with DID tend to have, like ''depression'', severe ''anxiety'', anger, and impulse-control problems. However, particular caution is appropriate when treating people with DID with medications because any effects they may experience, good or bad, may cause the sufferer of DID to feel like they are being controlled, and therefore traumatized yet again. As DID is often associated with episodes of severe ''depression'', ''electroconvulsive therapy'' (''ECT'') can be a viable treatment when the combination of psychotherapy and medication does not result in adequate relief of symptoms.'  "
What is the prognosis for dissociative identity disorder?,"'Research indicates that people with dissociative identity disorder have their best opportunity for living a well-adjusted life if they receive comprehensive treatment for their multiple symptoms. However, differences in how practitioners diagnose and treat this illness make it difficult to quantify or predict outcomes.' "
What are complications of dissociative identity disorder?,"'As with other mental health conditions, the prognosis for people with DID becomes much less optimistic if not appropriately treated. Individuals with a history of being sexually abused, including those who go on to develop dissociative identity disorder, are vulnerable to abusing alcohol or other substances as a negative way of coping with their victimization. People with DID are also at risk for attempting ''suicide'' more than once. Violent behavior has a high level of association with dissociation as well. Other debilitating outcomes of DID, like that of other severe chronic mental illnesses, include inability to obtain and maintain employment, poor relationships with others, and therefore overall lower productivity and quality of life.' "
Is it possible to prevent dissociative identity disorder?,"'Given that the origin of dissociative identity disorder in the majority of individuals remains related to exposure to traumatic events, prevention for this disorder primarily involves minimizing the exposure to traumatic events, as well as helping survivors of trauma come to terms with what they have been through in a healthy way.' "
What Is Bowel Diversion Surgery?,"'Bowel diversion surgery allows ''stool'' to safely leave the body when (because of disease or injury) the ''large intestine'' is removed or needs time to heal. Bowel is a general term for any part of the small or ''large intestine''.''Some bowel diversion surgeries (those called ostomy surgery)divert the bowel to an opening in the abdomen where a ''stoma'"" is created. A surgeon forms a stoma by rolling the bowel's end back on itself, like a shirt cuff, and stitching it to the abdominal wall. An ostomy pouch is attached to the stoma and worn outside the body to collect ""'stool''.''Other bowel diversion surgeries reconfigure the ''intestines'' after damaged portions are removed. For example, after removing the colon, a surgeon can create a colon like pouch out of the last part of the small intestine, avoiding the need for an ostomy pouch.''Cancer'', ''trauma'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (''IBD''), bowel obstruction, and ''diverticulitis'' are all possible reasons for bowel diversion surgery.''' "
Which Parts of the Gastrointestinal Tract Are Affected by Bowel Diversion Surgeries?,"'Bowel diversion surgeries affect the large intestine and often the small intestine.''Small Intestine''''The small intestine runs from the stomach to the large intestine and has three main sections: the duodenum, which is the first 10 inches; the jejunum, which is the middle 8 ''feet''; and the ileum, which is the final 12 ''feet''. Bowel diversion surgeries only affect the ileum.''''\xa0''Large Intestine''''The large intestine is about 5 feet long and runs from the small intestine to the anus. The colon and rectum are the two main sections of the large intestine. Semisolid digestive waste enters the colon from the small intestine. Gradually, the colon absorbs moisture and forms stool as digestive waste moves toward the rectum. The rectum is about 6 inches long and is located right before the anus. The rectum stores stool, which leaves the body through the anus. The rectum and anus control bowel movements.' "
What are the different types of bowel diversion surgery?,"'Several surgical options exist for bowel diversion.''Some people only need a temporary bowel diversion; others need permanent bowel diversion.' Ileostomy diverts the ileum to a stoma. Semisolid waste flows out of the stoma and collects in an ostomy pouch, which must be emptied several times a day. An ileostomy bypasses the colon, rectum, and anus and has the fewest complications. Colostomy is similar to an ileostomy, but the colon (not the ileum)is diverted to a stoma. As with an ileostomy, stool collects in an ostomy pouch. Ileoanal reservoir surgery is an option when the large intestine is removed but the anus remains intact and disease-free. The surgeon creates a colonlike pouch, called an ileoanal reservoir, from the last several inches of the ileum. The ileoanal reservoir is also called a pelvic pouch or J-pouch. Stool collects in the ileoanal reservoir and then exits the body through the anus during a bowel movement. People who have undergone ileoanal reservoir surgery initially have about six to 10 bowel movements a day. Two or more surgeries are usually required, including a temporary ileostomy, and an adjustment period lasting several months is needed for the newly formed ileoanal reservoir to stretch and adjust to its new function. After the adjustment period, bowel movements decrease to as few as 4 to 6 a day. Continent ileostomy is an option for people who are not good candidates for ileoanal reservoir surgery because of damage to the rectum or anus but do not want to wear an ostomy pouch. As with ileoanal reservoir surgery, the large intestine is removed and a colon-like pouch, called a Kock pouch, is made from the end of the ileum. The surgeon connects the Kock pouch to a stoma. A Kock pouch must be drained each day by inserting a tube through the stoma. An ostomy pouch is not needed and the stoma is covered by a patch when it is not in use."
Which bowel diversion surgery is appropriate?,"'The type, degree, and location of bowel damage, and personal preference, are all factors in determining which surgery is most appropriate. For example, people whose disease affects the ileum are poor candidates for ileoanal reservoir surgery or continent ileostomy because of the increased risk of disease recurrence and the need for pouch removal.''Discussing treatment options with a doctor and seeking the advice of an ostomy nursea (specialist who cares for people with bowel diversions)are highly recommended.' "
Concerns Related to Bowel Diversion,"'Although bowel diversion surgery can bring great relief, many people fear the practical, social, and psychological issues related to bowel diversion. An ostomy nurse is trained to help patients deal with these issues both before and after surgery. People living with an ostomy or who need bowel diversion surgery may also find useful advice and information through local or online support groups.' "
Bowel Diversion Surgery at A Glance," Bowel diversion surgery allows stool to safely leave the body when (because of disease or injury) the large intestine is removed or needs time to heal. Bowel is a general term for any portion of the small or large intestine. The type, degree, and location of bowel damage, and personal preference, are all factors in determining which bowel diversion surgery is most appropriate. An ostomy nurse can help patients deal with the practical, social, and psychological issues related to bowel diversion."
Hope through Research,"'The National Institute of ''Diabetes'' and Digestive and Kidney Diseases conducts and supports basic and clinical research into many digestive disorders, including ''inflammatory bowel disease'' and ''diverticular disease''.''Participants in ''clinical trials'' can play a more active role in their own health care, gain access to new research treatments before they are widely available, and help others by contributing to medical research.

What is diverticulosis? What does it look like (pictures)?,"'The colon (''large intestine'' or large bowel) is a long tube-like structure approximately 6 ''feet'' in length that stores and then eliminates waste material left over after ''digestion'' of food in the small intestine takes place. It is thought that pressure within the colon causes bulging pockets of tissue (sacs) that push out from the colonic walls as a person ages. A small bulging sac pushing outward from the colon wall is called a ''diverticulum''. More than one bulging sac is referred to in the plural as diverticula. Diverticula can occur throughout the colon but are most common near the end of the left colon, referred to as the sigmoid colon, in Western countries. In Asia, the diverticula occur mostly on the right side of the colon. The condition of having these diverticula in the colon is called diverticulosis.''Diverticula are common in the Western world but are rare in areas such as Asia and Africa. Diverticula increase with age. They are uncommon before the age of 40, but are seen in more than 74% of people over the age of 80 years in the U.S. A person with diverticulosis usually has few or no symptoms. The most common symptoms associated with diverticulosis are ''abdominal pain'', ''constipation'', and ''diarrhea''. In most people with diverticular disease, the symptoms may be due to the concomitant presence of ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS'') or abnormalities in the function of the muscles of the sigmoid colon; simple diverticula should cause no symptoms. Occasionally, bleeding originates from a diverticulum, and it is referred to as diverticular bleeding.' "
What is diverticulitis?,"'When a diverticulum ruptures and inflammation and infection sets in around the diverticulum, the condition is called diverticulitis. Often, a person with diverticulitis has symptoms and signs that include:' Abdominal pain Abdominal tenderness An obstruction in the colon (colonic obstruction) An elevated white blood cell count in the blood, and fever."
What causes diverticula and how do diverticula form?,"'The muscular wall of the colon grows thicker with age, although the cause of this thickening is unclear. It may reflect the increasing pressures required by the colon to eliminate feces. For example, a diet low in fiber can lead to small, ''hard stools'' which are difficult to pass and which require increased pressure to pass. The lack of fiber and small stools also may allow segments of the colon to close off from the rest of the colon when the colonic muscle in the segment contracts. The pressure in these closed-off segments may become high since the increased pressure cannot dissipate to the rest of the colon. Over time, high pressures in the colon push the inner intestinal lining outward (herniation) through weak areas in the muscular walls. These pouches or sacs that develop are called diverticula.''Lack of fiber in the diet has been thought to be the most likely cause of diverticula, and there is a good correlation among societies around the world between the amount of fiber in the diet and the prevalence of diverticula. Nevertheless, studies have not found similar correlations between fiber and diverticula within individual societies. Many people with diverticular disease have excessive thickening of the muscular wall of the colon where the diverticula form. The muscle also contracts more strongly. These abnormalities of the muscle may be contributing factors in the formation of diverticula. Microscopic examination of the edges of the diverticula show signs of inflammation, and it has been suggested that inflammation may be important for the formation of the diverticula and not just the result of them.'  "
What are diverticulitis symptoms?,"'Most patients with diverticulosis have few or no symptoms. The diverticulosis in these individuals is found incidentally during tests for other intestinal problems. It has been thought as many as 20% of individuals with diverticulosis will develop symptoms related to the diverticulosis, primarily diverticulitis; however, the most recent study suggests that the incidence is closer to 5%.''The most common signs and symptoms of diverticulitis include:'   Abdominal pain (left lower abdomen) Abdominal tenderness (left lower abdomen) Fever Elevated white blood cell count in the blood Constipation or, sometimes, diarrhea."
Is there a diverticulitis diet? What food should be avoided to prevent diverticulitis? What foods prevent flares?,"'Once formed, diverticula do not go away; they are permanent. No treatment has been shown to treat or prevent diverticular disease or diverticulitis. Nevertheless recommendations have been made in regard to which foods to eat, and which foods to avoid.''Since one theory holds that it is reduced fiber in the diet that causes diverticulitis, diets high in fiber are the most recommended treatment for diverticula. Fiber clearly increases ''stool'' bulk and prevents constipation, and, if it really reduces pressures in the colon, theoretically it may help prevent further diverticula formation or worsening of the diverticular condition. Foods high in fiber include:''Some doctors recommend avoiding nuts, ''corn'', and seeds, which are thought by some to plug diverticular openings and cause diverticulitis, but there is little evidence to support this recommendation. Nevertheless, foods frequently recommended to be avoided include:''Because inflammation has been found at the edges of diverticula, it has been speculated that colonic bacteria may be playing a role in the rupture of diverticula by promoting inflammation. This has led some people to further speculate that changing the bacteria in the colon might reduce inflammation and rupture and to suggest treatment with ''probiotics'' and/or prebiotics; however, there is not enough evidence of a benefit of ''probiotics'' yet to recommend treatment with probiotics of patients with diverticular disease.'   Fruits and vegetables Legumes/beans, (for example, lima, kidney, cannellini, and red kidney beans; chickpeas, split peas, and tofu) Whole grains (for example, brown rice, cracked wheat, oatmeal, quinoa, rolled oats, rye bread, wild rice; and whole wheat bread, cereal, crackers, pasta, and tortillas) Popcorn Poppy seeds Sesame seeds"
What are the more serious complications of diverticulitis?,"'More serious complications of diverticulitis include:''A diverticulum can rupture, and the bacteria within the colon can spread into the tissues surrounding the colon. This is then called diverticulitis. Constipation or diarrhea also may occur with the inflammation. A collection of pus can develop around the ruptured diverticulum, leading to formation of an abscess, usually in the pelvis. Inflammation surrounding the colon also can lead to colonic obstruction. Infrequently, a diverticulum ruptures freely into the abdominal ''cavity'' causing a life threatening infection called bacterial peritonitis. On rare occasions, the inflamed diverticulum can erode into the urinary bladder, causing ''bladder infection'' and passing of ''intestinal gas'' in the urine. Even more rarely the diverticulum can rupture into the vagina.''Diverticular bleeding occurs when the expanding diverticulum erodes into a blood vessel within the wall of the diverticulum. Rectal passage of red, dark or maroon-colored blood and clots occur without any associated abdominal ''pain'' if there is no diverticulitis, but bleeding into the colon also may occur during an episode of diverticulitis. Blood from a diverticulum of the right colon may cause the ''stool'' to become black in color. Bleeding may be continuous or intermittent, lasting several days.''Patients with active bleeding usually are hospitalized for observation. Intravenous fluids are given to support the ''blood pressure''. Blood transfusions are necessary for those with moderate to severe blood loss. In a rare individual with brisk and severe bleeding, the blood pressure may drop, causing ''dizziness'', ''shock'', and ''loss of consciousness''. In most patients, bleeding stops spontaneously and they are sent home after several days in the hospital. Patients with persistent, severe bleeding require surgical removal of the bleeding diverticulum although several nonsurgical treatments have been suggested.' Collection of pus (abscess) in the pelvis where the diverticulum has ruptured Colonic obstruction due to extensive inflammation Generalized infection of the abdominal cavity (bacterial peritonitis) Bleeding into the colon"
What tests and imaging procedures diagnose diverticulitis and diverticulosis?,"'The signs and symptoms of diverticulitis are common and distinctive enough that the presence of diverticulitis is usually suspected. If suspected, the diagnosis can be confirmed by a variety of tests. Barium X-rays (barium enemas) can be performed to visualize the colon. Diverticula are seen as barium filled pouches protruding from the colon wall.''Direct visualization of the inside of the colon and the openings of the diverticula can be done with flexible tubes inserted through the rectum and advanced into the colon. Either short tubes (sigmoidoscopes) or longer tubes (colonoscopes) may be used to assist in the diagnosis and to exclude other diseases that can mimic diverticular disease.''In patients suspected of having diverticulitis ''ultrasound'', CT (computerized tomograph) and ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'') scans of the abdomen and pelvis can be ordered to detect inflammation of the tissues surrounding the ruptured diverticulum or collections of pus.' "
What home treatment or remedies help soothe diverticulitis symptoms?,"'Patients may have multiple episodes of diverticular disease or diverticulitis, and may be difficult to distinguish between the two. Milder episodes of pain may be treated at home with bed rest, medications for pain and spasm, and a clear ''liquid diet''. Patients should take their temperature frequently and push on their lower left abdomen where most diverticula are located. ''At the first sign of fever or increasing tenderness--signs of inflammation--a doctor should be consulted immediately'' for a possible visit to his office and/or the initiation of antibiotics; there is nothing as valuable as a physical examination by the doctor to help make decisions about further treatment or hospitalization.' "
What medications treat diverticulitis and diverticulosis?,"'Most patients with diverticulosis have minimal or no symptoms, and do not require any specific treatment. A normal fiber diet is advisable to prevent constipation and perhaps prevent the formation of more diverticula.''Patients with mild symptoms of abdominal pain due to muscular spasm in the area of the diverticula may benefit from anti-spasmodic drugs, for example,\xa0''When diverticulitis occurs, antibiotics usually are needed. Oral antibiotics are sufficient when symptoms are mild. Some examples of commonly prescribed antibiotics include''Liquid or low fiber foods are advised during acute attacks of diverticulitis. This is done to reduce the amount of material that passes through the colon, which at least theoretically, may aggravate the diverticulitis. In severe diverticulitis with high fever and pain, patients are hospitalized and given intravenous antibiotics. Surgery is needed for patients with persistent bowel obstruction, bleeding, or abscess not responding to antibiotics.'   chlordiazepoxide (Librax), dicyclomine (Bentyl), atropine, scopolamine, phenobarbital (Donnatal), and hyoscyamine (Levsin). ciprofloxacin (Cipro), metronidazole (Flagyl), cephalexin (Keflex), and doxycycline (Vibramycin)."
What is the surgical treatment for diverticulitis?,"'Diverticulitis that does not respond to medical treatment requires surgical intervention. Surgery usually involves drainage of any collections of pus and resection (surgical removal) of the segment of the colon containing the diverticula, usually the sigmoid colon. Surgical removal of the bleeding diverticulum also is necessary for those with persistent bleeding. In patients needing surgery to stop persistent bleeding, it is important to determine exactly where the bleeding is coming from in order to guide the surgeon.''Sometimes, diverticula can erode into the adjacent urinary bladder, causing severe recurrent urine infection and passage of ''gas'' during urination. This situation also requires surgery.''Sometimes, surgery may be suggested for patients with frequent, recurrent attacks of diverticulitis leading to multiple courses of antibiotics, hospitalizations, and days lost from work. During surgery, the goal is to remove all, or almost all, of the colon containing diverticula in order to prevent future episodes of diverticulitis. There are few long-term consequences of resection of the sigmoid colon for diverticulitis, and the surgery often can be done laparoscopically, which limits post-operative pain and time for recovery.' "
What is diverticulosis and diverticulitis?,"'Diverticulosis'':''Diverticula'' are small, bulging pouches that form in the lining of the large gut in some individuals. The presence of diverticula is known as'' ''diverticulosis''. They are usually seen in people over the age of 40 years and are mostly harmless.''Diverticulitis'':''The condition when one or more diverticula become inflamed or infected due to the accumulation of waste products and bacteria is called ''diverticulitis''. ''Diverticulitis'' can cause ''fever'', severe ''abdominal pain'', ''nausea'', and change in bowel habits. Diverticulitis may be mild and treated conservatively with ''diet'', medication, and rest. Severe and recurrent diverticulitis would require surgery.' "
What are the signs and symptoms?,"'In many cases, ''diverticulosis'' is asymptomatic. The condition may go undiagnosed till a routine ''colonoscopy'' is done. However, in a few individuals, diverticulitis causes symptoms - referred to as a diverticulitis attack or flare-up.\xa0One may have multiple, recurring episodes of flare-ups. The symptoms usually occur suddenly and may persist for days.''The most common signs and symptoms of a diverticulitis attack include:' Sharp, cramping pain over the lower abdomen, usually on the left side Nausea Vomiting Fever Chills Constipation or diarrhea Bloating Tenderness over the affected area of your abdomen"
What are the causes?,"'Diverticulitis occurs when one or more diverticula become inflamed or infected due to the accumulation of waste products and bacteria. Diverticulitis occurs due to the presence of ''diverticulosis''.''Certain factors that may increase the risk of diverticulosis and diverticulitis, such as:' Genetics: Genetics may play an important role. Having family members who have diverticulitis increases the risk of getting the condition. Age: The risk of getting diverticulitis increases with age, usually over the age of 40 years. Smoking: Nicotine and other chemicals in cigarettes and tobacco products can weaken the lining of the colon, causing diverticulosis and in-turn, diverticulitis. Dehydration: Dehydration affects digestion causing accumulation of waste products and harmful bacteria in the colon. Medications: Some medications, such as long-term pain killers or steroids, can cause weakening or irritation of the colon. Sedentary lifestyle: Regular exercise may decrease the risk of diverticulitis. Obesity: Being overweight causes increased pressure on the colon, increasing the risk of diverticulosis and diverticulitis. Constipation: Chronic straining while passing stools increases the pressure on the wall of the colon."
How is diverticulitis treated?,"'Diverticulosis'' usually does not require treatment, but regular follow-up and lifestyle modifications may be advised.''Diverticulitis'' requires treatment and the treatment options depend on the severity of the signs and symptoms.''Mild or uncomplicated diverticulitis:''If the symptoms are mild, diverticulitis may be treated conservatively on an out-patient basis, at home. Treatment may include:''Severe or complicated diverticulitis:''A severe attack of diverticulitis may even require hospitalization. Treatment may include:''Surgery:''Surgery may be indicated in the following cases:''There are two main types of surgery:''Lifestyle modifications:''The following lifestyle modifications may help prevent diverticulitis or further attacks by promoting healthy bowel function:' Antibiotics to treat the infection A liquid diet until the symptoms improve, after which solid food can be slowly included in the diet. Plenty of rest Intravenous (IV) antibiotics Pain killers Drainage of abscess if one has formed Liquid diet Complications, such as abscess, fistula or bowel obstruction, or perforation of the bowel wall. Multiple, recurring episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis. A weak immune system due to other conditions like HIV or diabetes. Primary bowel resection: Diseased segments of the intestine are removed (resection) and the ends of the healthy segments are reconnected (anastomosis). This is also called bowel resection and anastomosis. It may be performed as an open surgery or a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) procedure. Bowel resection with colostomy: If the inflammation is severe, it may not be possible to reconnect the colon and rectum. In such cases, a colostomy may be performed. A colostomy is an opening (stoma) made in the abdominal wall, which is connected to the healthy part of the colon. Bowel waste (stools) passes through the opening and into the bag (colostomy bag). Once the inflammation resolves, the colostomy may be reversed, and the healthy segments of the bowel may be reconnected. Regular exercise A healthy, balanced diet that is rich in fiber  Drink plenty of fluids and remain hydrated Avoid smoking and other tobacco products Avoid taking medications without consulting with a doctor Regular follow-up as advised by the doctor"
What is pancreas divisum?," Pancreas divisum is a common congenital anomaly (an anomaly that is present at birth) of the pancreatic duct(s). The pancreas is a deep-seated organ located behind the stomach. One of its functions is to produce enzymes that are important for the digestion of food in the intestine. The digestive enzymes, in the form of digestive juice, drain from the pancreas via the pancreatic duct into the duodenum (the uppermost portion of the small intestine) where they aid in digesting food."
What causes pancreas divisum?,"'The human embryo starts life with a pancreas that is in two parts, each with its own duct; the ventral duct and the dorsal duct. The two parts of the pancreas fuse during development. In most embryos, the dorsal and the ventral ducts also will fuse to form one main pancreatic duct. The main pancreatic duct will join the common bile duct (the duct that drains bile from the gallbladder and the ''liver'') to form a common bile and pancreatic duct which drains into the duodenum through the major papilla.''In some embryos, the dorsal and the ventral ducts fail to fuse. Failure of the ventral and the dorsal pancreatic ducts to fuse is called pancreas divisum (because the pancreas is drained by two ducts). In pancreas divisum, the ventral duct drains into the major papilla, while the dorsal duct drains into a separate minor papilla.' "
What are pancreas divisum symptoms?,"'Most individuals born with pancreas divisum experience no symptoms throughout life, will remain undiagnosed, and will not require treatment. A small number of patients with pancreas divisum will experience repeated episodes of ''pancreatitis''. Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas that can cause ''abdominal pain'' as well as more severe complications. Some patients with pancreas divisum may develop chronic ''abdominal pain'' without pancreatitis.''Doctors are not certain how pancreas divisum causes ''abdominal pain'' and pancreatitis. One theory is that the minor papilla is too narrow to adequately drain the digestive juices in the dorsal portion of the pancreas. The backup of the digestive juices elevates the pressure in the minor duct that causes abdominal ''pain'' and pancreatitis. Others believe that there must be other factors above and beyond the anatomic anomaly of pancreas divisum that predispose a certain population of patients to develop pancreatitis. Research continues in order to determine the exact relationship.'  "
How is pancreas divisum diagnosed?,"'\tThe most accurate test to diagnose pancreas divisum is ''ERCP'' (''endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography''), which can demonstrate the presence of two separately draining pancreatic ducts. However, ERCP itself sometimes can cause attacks of pancreatitis. Other tests that can help diagnose pancreas divisum without the risk of causing pancreatitis include ''endoscopic ultrasound'' (EUS), and ''MRI'' (''magnetic resonance imaging'').' "
What is the treatment for pancreas divisum?,"'\tPancreas divisum without symptoms needs no treatment. Treatment of patients with abdominal ''pain'' and recurrent pancreatitis attributable to pancreas divisum has not been well established. Some doctors will attempt sphincterotomy (cutting of the minor papilla during ERCP to enlarge its opening). Others will insert a ''stent'' during ERCP into the duct to prevent duct blockage. These procedures are not risk free. Therefore, patients with symptomatic pancreas divisum are best evaluated and treated by doctors in centers experienced in treating pancreatic diseases.'  "
What is the prognosis for pancreas divisum?,"'\tMost patients with pancreas divisum remain asymptomatic and therefore the prognosis is excellent. For those patients with symptoms of pancreatitis, the prognosis is no different than that of the unaffected population who develop pancreatitis. Even after treatment, pancreatitis may recur. It is important to remember that there is no clear evidence to support a causal relationship between pancreas divisum and pancreatitis.' "
Introduction to dizziness (feeling dizzy),"'Dizziness is one of the most common symptoms that will prompt a person to seek medical care. The term dizziness is sometimes difficult to understand since it means different things to different people. It is either the sensation of feeling lightheaded as if the individual is weak and will pass out, or it describes vertigo or the sensation of spinning, as if the affected person just got off a merry-go-round.''Lightheadedness is often caused by a decrease in blood supply to the brain, while vertigo may be caused by disturbances of the inner ear and the balance centers of the brain. It is important that the doctor understand the complaint the person is experiencing. That is the important first step to find a diagnosis and begin treatment.' "
What causes dizziness?,"'While classifying dizziness into lightheadedness and vertigo categories may help understand how the body works, sometimes it is worthwhile to review common reasons why people might complain of dizziness.'  "
Low blood pressure as a cause of dizziness,"'Dizziness, lightheadedness, and the feeling of passing out is a common complaint in people who have ''low blood pressure''. When the ''blood pressure'"" is too low, not enough oxygen-rich blood is delivered to the brain, and its function can be affected. If the brain's blood supply is decreased too much, the person may pass out (syncope). Symptoms may worsen when changing position from lying down or sitting to standing up.""'In addition to feeling dizzy, associated symptoms may include:''Low blood pressure'' may be the result of an underlying illness or disease, or it may be a normal physiologic condition. Some common reasons for low blood pressure include the following:' Sweating Weakness Nausea and vomiting Shortness of breath Chest pain Anemia (decreased red blood cell count) due to decreased production or increased destruction of red blood cells Bleeding that may cause anemia due to red blood cell loss Dehydration (loss of water in the body) often occurs with infections that cause vomiting and diarrhea. Fever also can cause a significant amount of water loss due to increased metabolic rate and excessive sweating as the body tries to cool itself. Heat-related illnesses associated with dehydration such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion, or heat stroke (a medical emergency) Side effects of certain medications used to control blood pressure and heart rate. Examples include:Beta blockers (propranolol [Inderal, Inderal LA], atenolol [Tenormin], metoprolol, [Lopressor, Toprol XL]), which block adrenalin receptors in the heart and may limit the ability of the heart rate to increase in response to changes of position, decreased red blood cell count, or dehydrationNitroglycerin and isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur), a long-acting nitroglycerin, are medications that are prescribed to dilate blood vessels in the heart to treat angina. However, these medications also cause other blood vessels in the body to dilate, decreasing blood pressure.Diuretics that can cause dehydrationACE inhibitors that slow the heart rateMedications for erectile dysfunction (sildenafil [Viagra, Revatio], tadalafil [Cialis], and vardenafil [Levitra, Staxyn ODT], avanafil [Stendra]) that can dilate blood vessels Beta blockers (propranolol [Inderal, Inderal LA], atenolol [Tenormin], metoprolol, [Lopressor, Toprol XL]), which block adrenalin receptors in the heart and may limit the ability of the heart rate to increase in response to changes of position, decreased red blood cell count, or dehydration Nitroglycerin and isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur), a long-acting nitroglycerin, are medications that are prescribed to dilate blood vessels in the heart to treat angina. However, these medications also cause other blood vessels in the body to dilate, decreasing blood pressure. Diuretics that can cause dehydration ACE inhibitors that slow the heart rate Medications for erectile dysfunction (sildenafil [Viagra, Revatio], tadalafil [Cialis], and vardenafil [Levitra, Staxyn ODT], avanafil [Stendra]) that can dilate blood vessels Alcohol use Pregnancy"
Postural or orthostatic hypotension as a cause of dizziness,"'In individuals who are dehydrated or ''anemic'', blood pressure readings may be normal when they are lying flat; however, the lack of fluid is unmasked when they stand up quickly. The lack of blood to the brain may cause dizziness and lightheadedness. This feeling may pass in a few seconds as the body adapts. However, if dehydration or medications (for example, beta blockers) prevent the body from reacting by constricting blood vessels and increasing the heart rate, the dizziness may persist to the point at which the patient passes out (faints, or experiences syncope).''Some diseases are associated with an inability to compensate for changes in body position (autonomic dysfunction). Normally when a person stands, blood vessels contract to increase blood pressure slightly, and the heart rate also increases slightly, to pump blood uphill to the brain against gravity. In autonomic dysfunction, a person may become dizzy when they move from a lying position to sitting or standing up. Examples of these diseases with this syndrome include ''diabetes'"", Addison's disease, or """"Parkinson's""' disease.''Orthostatic ''hypotension'' is a common symptom with Shy-Drager syndrome. Shy-Drager syndrome is a rare disease in which the autonomic nervous system degenerates and cannot provide the routine control mechanisms for the body including heart rate, blood pressure, and bowel and bladder function.'  "
High blood pressure,"'High blood pressure'', or ''hypertension'', is known as the ""silent killer"" since it often has no symptoms, even if blood pressure readings are markedly elevated. On occasion, a person may complain of ''headache'', ''nausea'"", or dizziness, although the complaints don't necessarily correlate with the degree of blood pressure elevation.""'However, if the blood pressure is elevated and the person has symptoms, there is a need to bring the blood pressure under control relatively quickly. The more severe the symptoms, the quicker blood pressure needs to be controlled. For example, if a person is having ''chest pain'' or ''stroke symptoms'' associated with ''high blood pressure'', the blood pressure needs to be controlled immediately (hypertensive emergency).''Elevated blood pressure without symptoms is not an emergency and, while the blood pressure needs to be brought under control, there is no urgency to do so immediately.' "
Diabetes as a cause of dizziness,"'Dizziness is a common complaint in persons with ''diabetes'', and may be caused by ''low blood sugar'' (''hypoglycemia''), ''high blood sugar'' (''hyperglycemia''), or autonomic dysfunction (see previous section).' Hypoglycemia or low blood sugar (hypo=low +glyc=sugar =emia=blood) describes an inadequate amount of glucose levels in the blood. A person with diabetes can develop hypoglycemia from a decrease of food intake, or from taking too much medication (insulin or oral tablets), which results in low blood sugar levels. In this situation the person experiences dizziness or lightheadedness because the brain lacks glucose to function properly. Individuals with diabetes and their families need to recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia, including dizziness, sweating, confusion, and potentially, coma. Immediate treatment is necessary. Give sugar-containing foods by mouth if the person is awake, or a glucagon injection may save the patient's life. Hyperglycemia (hyper=high +glyc=sugar +emia=blood) also may cause dizziness due to dehydration. High blood sugar levels occur because not enough insulin is available to allow cells to use glucose for energy metabolism. (Interestingly, brain cells do not need insulin to use glucose.) High blood sugars cause a variety of metabolic responses in the body leading to dehydration, anaerobic metabolism, and changes in the acid-base balance. This may result in a life-threatening condition including diabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic diabetic acidosis."
Endocrine diseases which cause dizziness," Diabetes (discussed previously) if not well controlled is one of the main endocrine diseases that may cause dizziness. Thyroid disease: Abnormalities of the thyroid may also cause dizziness as a symptom.Hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone) may cause palpitations, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness.Hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone) may cause low blood pressure and a decreased heart rate leading to lightheadedness, weakness, lethargy, and chills. Hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone) may cause palpitations, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness. Hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone) may cause low blood pressure and a decreased heart rate leading to lightheadedness, weakness, lethargy, and chills. Addison's disease: Addison's disease occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol to meet the needs of the body. Cortisol is a naturally occurring steroid produced by the body and is part of the stress response (often termed the ""fight or flight"" response). If cortisol levels are low, a patient may experience weakness, fatigue, lightheadedness, low blood sugar, and low blood pressure."
Hyperventilation as a cause of dizziness,"'While the body may use hyperventilation or rapid ''breathing'"" to help with acid-base balance, it may also occur as a response to an emotionally stressful situation. In hyperventilation syndrome, the rapid breathing eliminates some of the body's carbon dioxide, leading to a tingling sensation in the hands and ""'feet'', and around the mouth. Dizziness and lightheadedness are associated symptoms. The symptoms may increase the perceived emotional ''stress'' and cause even more hyperventilation. In severe hyperventilation, carbon dioxide levels drop enough to cause carpopedal spasm, in which the hands and feet become claw-like and difficult to move. Symptoms of hyperventilation resolve relatively quickly once the breathing rate returns to normal.''Hyperventilation is not always an emotional response. People with ''asthma'', exacerbations of ''COPD'', ''congestive heart failure'', and ''pneumonia'' also may breathe quickly to help maintain oxygen levels in the bloodstream. Hyperventilation is also present whenever the body becomes acidotic (for example, diabetic ketoacidosis); the rapid breathing is one correction method that the body uses to regulate its acid-base balance.' "
Heart conditions which cause dizziness,"'The heart is an electrical pump and for it to work, the electrical conduction system must be operating properly to stimulate the heart muscle to squeeze in a coordinated fashion and pump blood to the body. The heart muscle itself must be strong enough to pump blood, and the valves in the heart must work properly to allow blood to flow in the direction intended during contraction.' Conduction disturbances: Electrical conduction disturbances may make the heart beat too quickly (tachycardia) or too slowly (bradycardia), and either of these situations may result in an inadequate blood supply to the brain, causing dizziness or lightheadedness. Cardiomyopathy: Dizziness is also a symptom of cardiomyopathy (cardio=heart +myo=muscle + pathy= disease), a disease of the heart muscle, resulting in muscle that doesn't squeeze effectively. Most commonly the weakness is due to atherosclerotic heart disease or ischemic cardiomyopathy (ischemic=decreased blood supply), in which the heart muscle itself doesn't get enough blood supply to work properly. Other non-ischemic cardiomyopathies may be due to diabetes, alcohol use, and viral infections."
Vasovagal syncope as a cause of dizziness,"'Vasovagal syncope is a common cause of dizziness, lightheadedness, and ''fainting'"". The vagus nerve is overstimulated and causes the body's blood vessels to dilate and the heart to slow down. This anti-adrenaline effect decreases the ability of the heart to pump blood upward toward the brain. Without blood flow, the brain turns off. In Victorian England, young ladies' sensibilities were easily offended causing a vasovagal episode called a swoon.""'Some people faint at the sight of blood. Some parents faint when their child gets immunized. Some medical students faint at their first ''autopsy''. Many types of emotional and physical stressors can overstimulate the vagus nerve, causing dizziness, lightheadedness, and at times fainting (passing out).''Fainting is not normal. If a person is unconscious, activate the emergency medical system (call 911 if available), and seek medical care.' "
Dizziness and vertigo,"'Vertigo is often described as feeling dizzy, or as a sensation of spinning. A person may specifically mention that the room seems to be spinning around them. Sometimes the complaint is loss of balance or loss of equilibrium. This often occurs because of irritation in the inner ear (the part of the ear that involves balance, not ''hearing'').''The inner ear has two parts that help the body determine its position in space relative to gravity; 1) the semicircular canals and 2) the vestibule.''Three semicircular canals are aligned at right angles to each other. These canals are fluid filled and lined with a nerve-rich, crystal-encrusted membrane that transmits information to the cerebellum (the part of the brain that controls balance and coordination). The cerebellum collects information from the eyes (visual stimuli) and the nerve endings in muscles associated with proprioception (the perception of movement), to assist the brain in assessing where the body is in relationship to gravity every time one part of it moves.''Normally, when the head moves, fluid in the semicircular canals shifts, and that information is relayed to the brain. When the head stops moving, the fluid stops as well, and that information is relayed to the brain.''In some cases, there may be a short delay in the transmission of this information to the brain. For example, when a person rides on a merry-go-round or spins quickly around in circles, the fluid in the canals develop momentum and though the body stops spinning, the fluid in the semicircular canals may continue to move. This causes vertigo, or a sensation of spinning, and may cause the person to fall or stumble. It also may be associated with vomiting. While kids try to provoke these symptoms in play, they can be debilitating for an adult.' Inflammation: In patients with vertigo, inflammation of the fluid or irritation of the crystals on the membrane that lines the walls of the semicircular canals may cause the spinning sensation even without much head movement. Often, only one canal is involved and the patient may be symptom-free if they don't move. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV): BPPV may be caused when the crystals in the inner ear become dislodged and irritate the semicircular canals. Often the cause is not found, but there may be an association with unusual positioning or movement of the head. Examples include moving the head up and down while working on a computer, or dusting something above the level of the head. It is frequently seen in people older than 60 years of age. Labyrinthitis: Labyrinthitis (labyrinth=inner ear + itis=inflammation) may follow a viral infection which causes inflammation within the middle ear. Meniere's disease: This condition is a disorder of the flow of fluids of the inner ear. The three symptoms found together are vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Acoustic neuroma: This is a benign tumor of the ear that can be present with vertigo. Neurologic: Much less commonly, the cause of vertigo may arise from the brain. Stroke, tumors, seizures, and multiple sclerosis may be associated with vertigo. Trauma: Vertigo may be a symptom of concussion and minor head trauma."
What are the symptoms experienced when a person feels dizzy?," Lightheadedness is the feeling of weakness and faintness as if you are about to pass out. The symptoms tend to be short-lived, depending on the cause. There may be associated nausea, sweating, and blurred vision. If the cause is dehydration or bleeding, the symptoms may worsen by standing quickly and may resolve somewhat by lying down (orthostatic hypotension) Heart rhythm disturbances may occur without warning and may be associated with palpitations. This may come and go or it may persist. The heartbeat may be felt as too fast (often described as a pounding or fluttering), too slow, and/or irregular. Vertigo is the sensation of spinning and may present without warning and be associated with nausea and vomiting. People with inner ear problems may be debilitated and unable to move without generating symptoms. People with a cerebellar cause of vertigo such as a stroke or tumor may have associated coordination problems or difficulty walking, and other signs of stroke."
When should I call the doctor for dizziness?,"'Dizziness is a common complaint and often has resolved by the time the patient arrives to see a health care professional. Usually there is no rush to seek care. However, while the complaint of dizziness is not often an emergency, seek care immediately if it is accompanied by any of the following:' Chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations. These symptoms should not be ignored, as they suggest the heart may be the source of the dizziness. Dehydration. Often there may be an associated illness including fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. People with diabetes may have dizziness due to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) or high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), and may need emergent care to stabilize their insulin and medication requirements. Bleeding from any source. Altered mental status or thinking. This may include symptoms such as confusion, change in vision, change in speech, facial droop, weakness of one side of the body, or headache. These may be signs of stroke, bleeding in the brain, or tumor.FAST warning signs of a stroke:Face -- facial droopArm -- arm or leg weaknessSpeech -- difficulty speaking or understanding speechTime -- time is of the essence. Call 911. FAST warning signs of a stroke:Face -- facial droopArm -- arm or leg weaknessSpeech -- difficulty speaking or understanding speechTime -- time is of the essence. Call 911. Face -- facial droop Arm -- arm or leg weakness Speech -- difficulty speaking or understanding speech Time -- time is of the essence. Call 911. Vertigo may cause significant problems with vomiting and may be debilitating. Often, medical care is needed to control symptoms even though the underlying problem is not necessarily serious."
How is dizziness diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of dizziness begins with the health care professional deciding whether the complaint of dizziness refers to lightheadedness or vertigo. Further diagnosis continues once this distinction is made.'""The key to the diagnosis of dizziness is a thorough history and physical examination. Often the diagnosis is made by listening to the patient's story. The health care professional may ask about triggers that cause and relieve the symptoms of dizziness.""""A review of systems is a series of questions that review the patient's body functions. The doctor may ask questions about associated symptoms including fever, vomiting, ""'diarrhea'', chest ''pain'', shortness of breath, palpitations, or abnormal bleeding.''The doctor may review the past medical history, and this includes reviewing medications the patient is currently taking.''The doctor may do a thorough physical examination that may include:''Vital signs:'"" Taking the patient's blood pressure and pulse rate lying down and standing (called orthostatic or postural vital signs) often will indicate the fluid status of the body. In patients who are dehydrated or bleeding, the blood pressure may fall and pulse rate may rise on changing position. However, patients taking medications like beta blockers will not generate an increased pulse rate.""'Tailored physical examination:'"" Often, the physical examination is tailored to the patient based upon the information provided in the patient's medical history. For example, a woman with a heavy ""'menstrual period'' may need a pelvic examination, or a patient with ''cough'' and shortness of breath may need a closer examination of the heart and ''lungs''. A patient thought to have vertigo will have closer focus on the neurologic exam, including the cerebellum, the portion of the brain responsible for balance and coordination.''Imaging studies and blood tests:'' The need for imaging studies and/or blood tests will depend on the concerns the health care professional and patient have in regard to the cause of the dizziness. Common tests that may be ordered include:''X-rays'', ''CT scans'', and ''MRI'"" may be indicated depending upon the patient's needs.""   ""Is it related to changing positions quickly?"" ""Does it resolve on its own or does the patient have to do something, like lie down to make it better?"" ""Does turning the head bring on the symptoms? Do the symptoms resolve when the patient is very still?"" ""Is there associated hearing loss or ringing in the ears?"" Complete blood count (CBC) to screen for anemia or infection Electrolyte levels Blood sugar tests Kidney function tests Thyroid tests"
How is vertigo diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of vertigo is most often made based upon history and clinical presentation. If the patient is experiencing a spinning sensation that worsens by a change in position, and lessens by lying still, the health care professional can confirm the cause of dizziness as vertigo if there are appropriate findings on physical examination.''The doctor may take a further history to make certain that the symptom of vertigo is isolated to an inner ear condition and not due to a problem in the brain (for example, a stroke).''Neurological examination'""Physical examination will focus on the neurologic examination and may involve looking at eye movements. With vertigo, nystagmus may be present. Nystagmus is an involuntary movement of the eyes, slow and smooth in one direction with fast twitches in the other. It is the eyes' attempt to compensate for the abnormal signals created in the inner ear. The patient may be asked to lay flat or sit upright to uncover the presence of nystagmus.""""The doctor may test the patient's hearing to assess potential hearing loss. This may be seen in Meniere's disease or with an acoustic neuroma, but not necessarily with labyrinthitis or benign positional vertigo.""'The rest of the neurologic examination may be done to look for one-sided weakness, loss of coordination, or loss of balance as potential signs of stroke.'""Evaluation for BPPV or labyrinthitis is often complete at this point, although depending upon the health care professional's concerns, further testing may be indicated. Patients may be referred to a physical therapist specially trained in ""'vestibular'' therapy for diagnosis confirmation and symptom relief.''If there is confusion as to the potential cause of vertigo, imaging of the brain may be needed. ''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI) may be indicated since this test evaluates the cerebellum more accurately. ''Computerized tomography'' (''CT scan'') may be used in an emergency to look for bleeding in the brain.' "
How is dizziness treated?,"'Dizziness treatment''Dizziness is a symptom, not a disease, and treatment will be directed to the underlying cause. For example, dizziness or lightheadedness due to dehydration from ''gastroenteritis'' may require intravenous fluids and medications to stop the vomiting and diarrhea, while dizziness or lightheadedness from a heart rhythm condition may require admission to the hospital and specialized testing and treatment.''Vertigo treatment'   Vertigo from inner ear problems may often be treated with maneuvers to reposition the crystals and debris in the semicircular canals. Repositioning techniques that can be helpful include the Epley and Semont maneuvers, and the patient may be taught these to use at home. Depending upon the reason for the inner ear inflammation, the doctor may prescribe oral steroid medications to decrease that inflammation. Over-the-counter or prescription medication is occasionally recommended or prescribed to help with vertigo. Meclizine (Antivert) or diazepam (Valium) may control mild symptoms. In patients with intractable symptoms and vomiting, the doctor may consider intravenous diazepam (Valium). Patients with Meniere's disease or acoustic neuroma are usually referred to an ear, nose, and throat specialist (otolaryngologist, ENT doctor) for further evaluation and care."
What is dizziness?,"'Dizziness'' is\xa0a general term used to describe a range of sensations, such as feeling faint, light-headed, weak, or unsteady.\xa0''Dizziness''\xa0can create a false sense of a person’s head spinning or spinning of the surroundings or swaying. This may be associated with\xa0''nausea'',\xa0''vomiting'', ''sweating'', ''headache'', or difficulty ''walking''. ''Vertigo'' differs from dizziness because ''vertigo'' is a true sensation of self-spinning or spinning of the surrounding. Dizziness on the other hand is less severe, with a feeling of imbalance or feeling “wonky.”' "
What are the symptoms of dizziness?,'The common signs and symptoms of dizziness include:' Feeling of fainting  Lightheadedness  Loss of balance  False sense of spinning  Difficulty walking Unsteadiness  Nausea and vomiting 
What causes dizziness?,"'The causes of dizziness include the following:''Disorders of the inner ear'': The inner ear maintains the body balance by sending impulses to the brain\xa0about the head, neck, and body movements. The most common inner ear disorders causing dizziness include:\xa0''Benign paroxysmal positional ''vertigo'' (BPPV)'': BPPV usually has no specific trigger; it could because of ''trauma'' or sudden neck/head movements. In BPPV, canaliths (tiny calcium particles) get accumulated in canals of the inner ear.'""Meniere's""' disease'':\xa0It is an inner ear disorder in which the fluid accumulates in the inner ear and causes increased pressure. The cause may be genetic, ''allergies'', or autoimmune. Patients typically present with ''vertigo'', ''tinnitus'' (ringing sound in the ear), and ''hearing loss''/aural fullness (feeling of fullness in the ear).''Labyrinthitis'': It is inflammation of the nerves inside the inner ear. It can occur following viral or ''bacterial infections'', including just a ''common cold''.''Trauma'': Trauma to the ear or skull ''fractures'' can damage the structures of the inner ear.\xa0''Motion sickness'': Vertigo can be triggered while travelling, causing ''motion sickness''. It is also commonly associated with nausea and vomiting.''Medications'': Certain medications can cause inner ear damage.' Lesions (tumors) in the brain Inflammation/infection of the brain Stroke  Seizures  Cervical spine disorders such as cervical spondylosis  Multiple sclerosis  Parkinsonism  Alcohol intoxication  Vertigo associated with migraine (migrainous vertigo) Trauma to the head and neck Dehydration  Starvation Anemia Low blood pressure  Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) Heart disease  Anxiety "
What do you do when you feel dizzy?,"'The following is advised during an episode of dizziness:' Sitting or lying down immediately and resting in a cool place till the symptoms resolve. This prevents the risk of losing balance, leading to a fall and serious injury. One may use a cane or walker or handrails for support.  Avoiding sudden movements of the head and neck and suddenly changing positions can be helpful. Driving or doing any dangerous activities such as operating heavy machinery should be avoided.  Drinking fluids and remaining hydrated can help improve dizziness. Eating something sweet can help when you feel dizzy due to low blood sugar. Tripping hazards such as rugs on the floor, low tables, etc. should be removed in the house to lower the risk of fall in those who have frequent episodes of dizziness. One may take over-the-counter anti-vertigo medications such as Antivert (meclizine) or antihistamines. Painkillers may be taken if there is associated headache."
How is dizziness treated?,"'Treatment for vertigo depends on the cause. In some cases, vertigo may resolve without any treatment and never recur due to the ability of the brain to adapt. In other cases, the treatment options include:' Vestibular rehabilitation: This is a type of physical therapy, wherein the patient is taught certain exercises to help strengthen the inner ear system. Canalith repositioning maneuvers: These are specific maneuvers performed by a healthcare professional, where the movements are done to dislodge the calcium deposits out of the inner ear canal. Medication: In some cases, medication may be prescribed to suppress the inner ear or improve blood blow in the inner ear. Medications to relieve associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, headache, or motion sickness may be administered. Antibiotics would be prescribed in cases of infection or inflammation. Steroids may be needed to suppress inflammation and reduce swelling. In Meniere's disease, diuretics (pills that reduce fluid in the ear) may be prescribed to reduce pressure due to fluid accumulation. Surgery: In severe cases, when the vertigo does not resolve with medication and other conservative measures, surgery may be required for vertigo."
How to prevent dizziness?,"'The following measures may help reduce the frequency and intensity of the episodes of vertigo:' Doing activities that improve balance, such as vestibular rehabilitation exercises, yoga, or Tai Chi Adequate hydration by drinking at least eight glass of water a day Sleeping for least seven hours and avoiding stressful situations Eating a healthy diet that consists of vegetables, fruits, and lean proteins  Reducing the salt content in food Taking medications as prescribed Managing psychological stress/anxiety"
When to see a doctor for dizziness?,"'Patients who continue to have repeated episodes of ''dizziness'' need to consult with a doctor. ''Dizziness'' occurring along with the following require immediate medical attention:' Trauma to the head and neck Headache Neck pain High grade fever, with or without chills Blurring of vision Loss of heating Difficulty speaking or slurred speech Numbness or tingling Drooping of the eye or the angle of the mouth Loss of consciousness Chest pain Continuous vomiting Projectile vomiting (severe vomiting wherein the vomit is forcefully expelled several feet away from the person vomiting)"

''Vertigo'' differs from dizziness due to the fact that ''vertigo'' is a true sensation of self-spinning or spinning of the surrounding. Dizziness on the other hand is less severe, with a feeling of imbalance or feeling “wonky” and lightheaded.' "
What are the symptoms of dizziness?,'The common signs and symptoms of dizziness include:' Feeling of fainting  Lightheadedness  Loss of balance  False sense of spinning  Difficulty walking Unsteadiness  Nausea and vomiting Sweating  Palpitations 
What can you do when you have dizziness?,"'The following is advised during a sudden episode of dizziness:' Sitting or lying down immediately and resting in a cool place till the symptoms resolve. This prevents the risk of  losing balance, leading to a fall and serious injury. One may use a cane or walker or hand rails for support.  Avoiding sudden movements of the head and neck and sudden change positions. Driving or any dangerous activities like operating heavy machinery should be avoided.  Drinking fluids and remaining hydrated can help improve dizziness. Eating something sweet can help if the dizziness is caused due to low blood sugar, Tripping hazards such as rugs on the floor, low tables etc should be removed in the house to lower the risk of fall in those who have frequent episodes of dizziness. One may take over the counter anti-vertigo medications such as meclizine (Antivert) or antihistamines. Pain killers may be taken if there is associated headache."
What causes dizziness?,"'The causes of dizziness include the following:''The inner ear maintains balance by sending impulses to the brain\xa0about head, neck and body movements. The most common inner ear disorders of the inner ear causing dizziness include:\xa0''BPPV:'' BPPV usually has no specific trigger, it could be because of trauma or sudden neck/ head movements. In BPPV tiny calcium particles (canaliths) accumulate in canals of the inner ear.\xa0'""Meniere's""' disease'':\xa0An inner ear disorder which could be autoimmune (when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks it’s own cells). In this condition, fluid accumulates in the inner ear and increases pressure in the ear. Patient typically present with ''vertigo'', ''tinnitus'' (ringing sound in the ear) and ''hearing loss''/ feeling of fullness in the ear (aural fullness)\xa0''Labyrinthitis'': Inflammation of the ''labyrinth'' in the inner ear. It can occur following viral or ''bacterial infections'', including just a ''common cold''.''Trauma'': trauma to the ear or skull ''fractures'' can damage the structures of the inner ear.\xa0''Motion sickness'': Vertigo can be triggered while travelling causing ''motion sickness''. It is also commonly\xa0 associated with nausea and vomiting.''Medications'': certain medications can cause inner ear damage.' Disorders of the inner ear: Lesions (tumors) in the brain Inflammation/ infection of the brain Stroke  Seizures  Cervical spine disorders, such as cervical spondylosis  Multiple sclerosis  Parkinsonism  Alcohol intoxication  Vertigo associated with migraine (migranous vertigo) Trauma to the head and neck Dehydration  Starvation Anemia Low blood pressure  Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) Heart disease  Anxiety "
Can dizziness be prevented?,"'The following measures may help reduce the frequency and intensity of the episodes of vertigo:' Doing activities that improve balance, such as vestibular rehabilitation exercises, yoga or Tai Chi. Adequate hydration by drinking at least eight glasses of water a day. Undisturbed sleep of at least seven hours and avoiding stressful situations.  Eating a healthy diet that consists of vegetables, fruits and lean proteins  Reducing salt content in food.  Taking medications as prescribed. Manage psychological stress/ anxiety"
Do balance disorders go away?,"'Generally, ''balance disorders'' last for a couple of days and the patient recovers slowly over 1 to 3 weeks. However, some patients may experience symptoms that can last for several months. For symptoms that don’t go away with other treatments, the physician might prefer surgery.' "
What is a balance disorder?,"'A balance disorder is a condition characterized by ''dizziness'' and ''vertigo'' while standing still or lying down. ''Balance disorders'' can be caused due to certain medical conditions, injury, medications or an issue in the inner ear or the brain.''The dizzy spell may vary from person to person. For some, ''dizziness'' can be short-term whereas for oters dizziness may be an intense sensation of spinning that may last for a long time.''A balance disorder can deeply affect daily activities and cause physical or emotional disturbances.' "
What are the symptoms of a balance disorder?,"'Symptoms of a balance disorder include''Other symptoms may include' Dizziness or vertigo Swaying Confusion or disorientation Blurred vision Lightheadedness, faintness or a floating sensation Staggering while walking Feeling as if you are going to fall Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Changes in heart rate and blood pressure Fear Anxiety Panic Fatigue Depression"
What causes a balance disorder?,"'A balance disorder can be caused due to various factors, including''However, many ''balance disorders'' do not have an exact cause.' Viral or bacterial infections in the ear Head injury Cervical spondylosis Blood circulation disorders Certain medications Problems in the visual, nervous, circulatory and skeletal system Low blood pressure Arthritis Eye muscle imbalance"
What are the different types of balance disorders?,"'The different types of balance disorders include' Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) or positional vertigo: This is a short, powerful episode of vertigo that occurs due to a specific change in the position of the head. Labyrinthitis: Infection or inflammation in the inner ear causes dizziness and loss of balance. Meniere’s disease: Fluid change in the inner ear tube. Vestibular neuronitis: Viral infection may cause inflammation of the vestibular nerve. Perilymph fistula: This is the leakage of inner ear fluid into the middle ear. It can occur after a head injury due to drastic changes in atmospheric pressure (such as when scuba diving) or after ear surgery. Mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDs): This is characterized by continuous bobbing feeling after travelling on a ship."
How is a balance disorder diagnosed?,"'The physician may review your medical history as well as conduct a physical and neurological examination. To check problems in the balance function in the inner ear, the doctor might recommend the following tests' Hearing tests: Difficulties in hearing will be associated with balance problems. Posturography test: It indicates the part of the balance system that is used more. Electronystagmography and videonystagmography: These tests record your involuntary eye movements. Rotary chair test: Eye movements are analyzed while sitting in a computer-controlled chair. Dix-Hallpike maneuver: Rotation of the head in different motions while observing the eye movements can help to identify a false sense of motion or spinning. Vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials test: Sensor pads are attached to the neck and forehead to measure the muscle contractions in reaction to sounds. Imaging tests like MRI and CT scans Blood pressure and heart rate tests: Blood pressure measured while sitting and then standing for 2 to 3 minutes may help to determine if there is a significant fall in blood pressure."
How is a balance disorder treated?,"'Treatment depends on the cause of balance disorder, which may include' Treat any underlying infections using antibiotics or antifungals. Make changes in diet and activity, such as quitting smoking Try canalith repositioning maneuvers that are a specialized series of head and chest movements. These may remove small calcium deposits in the inner ear causing giddiness. Get surgery when medications and other therapies do not fix the problem. Receive rehabilitation, such as balance retraining therapy."
What does a cold sore feel like?,"'Symptoms are usually more severe during the first time someone develops a ''cold'' sore. When a person gets a cold sore outbreak, they may experience the following symptoms:''A cold sore is ''contagious'' starting from the period a person feels the initial symptoms (such as tingling, burning, and ''itching'') to the time the cold sore has healed completely (when the scab falls and skin has completely healed).' Tingling, itching, and/or burning sensations on or around the lips are usually the first signs of a cold sore. These symptoms generally start about 12-24 hours before the cold sore appears. Slowly blisters appear, which makes the affected part red, swollen, and painful. In the following two to three days the blisters rupture. The ruptured blisters ooze fluid that may be clear or yellowish. This phase of oozing fluid is called the “weeping phase.” In the next four to five days after the cold sore develops, it crusts and scabs over. The skin may crack or bleed as it heals. Ultimately, the scab falls off. The skin underneath may be a little more pink or reddish than usual for a few days. Usually, it may take a week or two for the sore to heal completely."
How can I prevent having a cold sore?,"'If you have not been infected with Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), you can protect yourself from having the infection by taking the following precautions around people with ''cold sores'':''If you have already been infected or have come in contact with HSV-1, you may reduce your risk of having a cold sore by:''In case you get a cold sore, avoid kissing a baby, and wash your hands with soap and water before you touch them as it may cause a dangerous condition in ''babies'', called ''neonatal'' herpes.' Avoid any kind of intimate contact, such as kissing and oral sex, with someone who has a cold sore. Do not share personal articles, such as toothbrushes, cosmetics, towels, razors, dishes, cutlery, and straws. Wash your hands before touching your face or genitals. Trying to stay healthy: Fever can be an important trigger for a cold sore. This is the reason cold sores are also called fever blisters. Avoiding mental and emotional stress: Keep yourself calm through different stress-reducing activities, such as reading, listening to music, yoga, and meditation. Maintaining a healthy immune system: Take proper diet and rest because fatigue may weaken your immune system and make you vulnerable to get sick. Protecting yourself from strong sunlight and wind: Avoid going out when it is too sunny or windy. You should protect your lips and from sunburn by wearing a sunscreen and lip balm with SPF."
What are collagen injections?,"'Collagen injection is a medical procedure approved by USFDA for use on the face and back of the hand. Collagen treatments can be used to soften ''wrinkles'' and unwanted facial lines, fill out ''depressed'' ''scars'' or add volume to the border of the lip. Collagen\xa0is a natural protein that gives skin its softness and fullness. It is the main protein found in connective tissue that supports the skin, bone, cartilage, and blood vessels. Collagen composes up to 80% of the skin. Its role is to maintain the skin’s integrity, but collagen breaks down due to mechanical action of the underlying muscles, the damaging effects of the sun, and the natural ''aging'' process. When collagen is injected with a fine needle just beneath the skin surface, it replenishes the lost skin material. It may be taken from an animal like a cow or from the patient’s own tissue.' "
How is the collagen injections procedure performed?,"'The procedure is usually done under local or topical anesthesia, ice may be used to numb the region. A nerve block is often used for lip injections. The procedure may take only a few minutes or longer depending on the areas injected.' A patient's face may be cleaned and prepared with an antibacterial cleanser. Pen marks may be made on the areas to be targeted. There are different ways to inject the collagen: Serial puncture technique: A series of small punctures will be made with the needle along the targeted area. Small amounts of collagen will be inserted at each puncture point. Linear threading or fanning technique: The needle will be inserted into the full length of the targeted area. The collagen will be injected slowly while the needle is removed or inserted. The procedure may often be repeated in deeper areas. Immediately after the treatment, there may be some temporary bruising, puffiness, or tenderness around the injection site. This is normal and gradually subsides in a few days. Patients can resume their daily activities almost immediately following the treatment. The longevity of a collagen treatment varies, lasting anywhere from 6 weeks to 6 months or more. Over time, the body will naturally absorb the collagen, and additional treatments will be necessary to maintain the aesthetic enhancement."
What are the benefits and risks of collagen injections?,"'As with any procedure, there are benefits and risks involved, which include:''Benefits:''Risks:''Factors that may increase the risk of complications include:' This injection process is clinically proven to fill wrinkles, lines, and scars. This is a relatively quick procedure with a low risk of complications. There’s no downtime, so the patient can go back to work or home immediately after the treatment. Most collagen injection products are derived from cows and contain lidocaine, which may be sensitive or allergic to a few patients. Side effects may include stinging, throbbing, burning, and irritation. More serious risks include infection, permanent lumps and irregularities, sore formation at the site of injection, nerve injury, and blindness if performed too close to the eye. Results may diminish as soon as 2-3 months after the treatment, depending on how quickly the body metabolizes the collagen. Smoking Taking blood thinners Allergies The tendency to form scars and keloids Active infections and cystic pimples at the time of injection"
What is a novel or new coronavirus (COVID-19)?,"'Coronaviruses are a large family of ''viruses'' that cause illness ranging from the ''common cold'' to more severe diseases like acute respiratory syndrome. They are named for having the shape of a ''crown'' surrounding the virus particle. A novel coronavirus is a newly identified coronavirus strain not previously recognized.''In 2019, a new coronavirus strain named ''COVID-19'' originating in Wuhan, China, began causing severe and potentially fatal ''pneumonia'' and respiratory illness throughout the world. The 2019 ''Wuhan coronavirus'' is related to the coronaviruses that caused the epidemics ''severe acute respiratory syndrome'' (''SARS'') and ''Middle East respiratory syndrome'' (''MERS'').''As with outbreaks from those earlier epidemics, people in Wuhan and other outbreak cities rushed to buy surgical masks to wear in public in the hope of protecting themselves. But do face masks work to prevent the coronavirus contagion? They can help -- although in a limited way -- because of how the coronavirus spreads.' "
How does a coronavirus (COVID-19) spread?,"'Coronavirus originally spread from animals to humans and then from person to person. Researchers are trying to work out the variety of ways that the new coronavirus spread. ''COVID-19'' had killed thousands in China as of early 2020 and also broke out in cities across the globe despite drastic quarantine measures.'""Early in the epidemic, scientists had learned the following facts about the new virus' transmission:"" Coronavirus spreads via respiratory droplets from an infected person. You may be at risk when you are within 6 feet from the infected person. Airborne respiratory droplets when the infected person coughs or sneezes can land on other people's mouth or nose and cause the virus to spread. It may be possible to get infected by touching a surface or object that has the virus and then touching one's own mouth or nose. Viruses may stay infectious on surfaces like door handles, etc., up to 9 days at room temperature. Researchers think people are most contagious when they have the most severe symptoms. People can be infectious before they start to show symptoms."
Can wearing a face mask protect you from the coronavirus (COVID-19)?,"'Face masks can play a role in preventing the infection, but that role is limited. A healthy individual in a normal situation does not need to wear a mask, as per CDC recommendations. A face mask is not the ideal solution for protection from the new coronavirus for the following reasons:''A surgical face mask is highly recommended for people who have the coronavirus infection or have a high risk of exposure. It offers a certain amount of protection against infection from your own hands or droplets from the ''cough'' or sneeze of an infected person. You should wear a face mask if''It is essential that caregivers dispose of the mask after every interaction and use a new one any time they are in close confines with an infected person.''People who care for infected people in a medical setting wear an N95 respirator, a mask with a special air filter designed to protect one from tiny airborne particles.'""These masks are designed to fit a person's face and are usually rounded in shape. Medical personnel receive special training to fit them properly so they do not breathe around the edges of the mask and defeat its purpose.""'These N95 masks are not recommended for the general public.' A surgical mask does not fit tightly over the nose and mouth. It is not possible to prevent airborne virus infection. It is difficult to keep a mask on for long periods of time. When you touch the mask, you lose the protection and must replace the mask, and dispose of it safely. you are infected and sick with the virus, you are caring for a person infected with the virus, you are a health worker, or you are in contact with infected people for any other reason."
How can people protect themselves from the coronavirus (COVID-19)?,"'At present, there is no ''vaccine'' to prevent ''COVID-19'', the ''Wuhan coronavirus'' infection. The practice of good hygiene is a better way to prevent the spread of the virus. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid exposure to the virus. Standard recommendations to follow include the following:' Wash hands often for at least 20 seconds. Wash hands after you use the restroom. Avoid touching the eyes, face, or nose with unwashed hands. Avoid going to areas where there is an outbreak. Leave areas of outbreak. Avoid close contact with infected people. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Cook meat and eggs thoroughly. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your mouth with tissue when you cough or sneeze, and then throw the tissue in the trash."
Do hair growth vitamins work?,"'Vitamins'' or herbal ''supplements'' for hair growth are often used to promote healthy hair growth and regrowth. ''Hair loss'' and damage can occur due to genetics, hormones (''pregnancy''), medications (''cancer'' medication) and other medical illnesses (''stress'', ''thyroid disease'' or autoimmune diseases). If there is ''hair loss'' or hair damage associated with a serious nutritional deficiency of certain ''vitamins'' or ''minerals'', hair growth ''supplements'' can help with hair growth or regrowth. The vitamins in hair growth supplements also help maintain overall body health. Alongside hair vitamins, a healthy and balanced ''diet'' is also required. If damaged hair is caused due to other conditions, hair growth supplements would not be sufficient to treat the problem. So, it is always important to consult with a doctor when one is experiencing significant ''hair loss''.' "
What are hair growth vitamins?,"'Some important supplements or vitamins that help hair growth are' Vitamin E nourishes the skin, nails and hair and protects the skin and hair from sun damage. Rich sources of vitamin E include plant-based oils, seeds, nuts, fruits and vegetables. Zinc can regulate the level of DHT (dihydrotestosterone) in the body, a hormone that can cause hair loss. A decrease in zinc levels causes an increase in DHT, which can cause hair loss. Sesame seeds, nuts, eggs and fish are rich in zinc. Iron is essential for hair growth. Low iron levels lead to anemia. Low iron levels affect the hair follicles and disrupt the growth cycle of the hair, leading to hair loss. Rich sources of iron include lentils, red meat, spinach or green vegetables. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that aids in the formation of collagen. Vitamin C also helps with iron absorption. Rich sources of vitamin C include kiwis, sweet potato and citrus fruits like oranges. Vitamin D is important for healthy hair follicle production, which promotes hair growth. Vitamin D also helps relieve stress and depression. It is found in eggs, oily fish and mushrooms. Vitamin A helps form sebum, which is required to keep the scalp and skin conditioned and healthy. A decrease in sebum due to Vitamin A deficiency causes the scalp to become dry, irritated, itchy and flaky. It also causes the hair to become dry, brittle and break easily. However, it must be remembered that higher than normal vitamin A consumption can also cause hair loss. Vitamin A is found in orange or yellow vegetables like carrots. Amino acids are essential for healthy hair growth. Amino acids help produce keratin, which promotes hair growth and nourishes and improves hair texture. Amino acids are protein building blocks found in foods like dairy, meat and eggs. Omega-3 fatty acids produce oils that keep the skin, nails and scalp healthy and hydrated. Fish, avocado and pumpkin seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Biotin is a water-soluble B vitamin, which is also called vitamin H or coenzyme R. Biotin increases nail and hair strength and texture."
How long do hair supplements take to work?,"'Taking hair growth supplements does not produce results overnight. It usually takes a very long time to see obvious hair growth. Normally, hair grows only half an inch a month,\xa0so even after taking supplements it would take 5 to 6 years for a new strand of hair to reach shoulder length.''However, there are several other changes in the hair that can be seen. After a few months of taking supplements, the oil glands on the scalp get reactivated, which moisturizes and nourishes the scalp and hair. The hair starts to appear shinier, more moisturized and healthier. The hair may not be as brittle as it used to be, reducing hair breakage.' "
What is a hair transplant?,"'A hair transplant is a procedure in which there is the removal of small pieces (punch grafts) of tissue from the hair-bearing scalp. This is called a donor area, and it is cut into smaller pieces to place these on a bald or thinning area of the scalp. The procedure is also called hair restoration surgery. It gives good and long-lasting results. A hair transplant is typically done as an out-patient procedure in the doctor’s office or any other out-patient setting. People who have significant ''hair loss'' are generally the candidates for hair transplant procedures. Compared to the olden days hair transplants where there used to be unnatural looking hair with visible hair plugs, modern-day hair transplants provide natural-looking hair and thus a higher satisfaction in the people who undergo the procedure.\xa0' "
What happens during a hair transplant procedure?,"'A hair transplant is typically done as an out-patient procedure in the doctor’s office or any other out-patient setting. The procedure typically takes around four to eight hours to complete. In people who need a large amount of hair transplant, there may be a need to return for a few hours the next day. During the surgery, the surgeon cleans the scalp and injects the scalp with a numbing medication (local anesthesia). The patient stays awake during the procedure. The surgeon may give a mild sedative to help the patent stay comfortable and relaxed during the procedure.''The surgeon will then remove the healthy hair by either cutting a strip of the scalp skin with healthy hairs or removing individual hairs. This is done to give natural-looking hair and avoid the appearance of visible hair plugs. Removing individual hair is a time-consuming ''exercise'' but gives more aesthetically acceptable results. Before transplanting the harvested hair, they need to be prepared. The area of the scalp to be transplanted with hair is also prepared by the surgeon.''The hair to be transplanted is then placed in the area that needs hair. Two to three members of the hair transplant team may be involved in the procedure depending on the number of hair to be transplanted. After all the hair has been transplanted, the scalp is bandaged. The patient is given instructions about the care needed at home and when they have to come back for a follow-up.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of hemangiomas?,"'Hemangiomas of the skin initially appear as small red ''bumps''. Gradually, as the blood vessels multiply further, the hemangiomas look like big, burgundy-colored bumps. Their resemblance to the deep red color of strawberry has given them the name of strawberry hemangiomas.''Hemangiomas generally do not produce any symptoms unless they are multiple or located in a sensitive area, such as near the eye.''Hemangiomas that grow in the internal organs, such as the liver and other organs of the digestive system, can cause problems like:' Nausea Vomiting Loss of appetite Abdominal discomfort"
How are hemangiomas diagnosed?,"'Most hemangiomas do not need any special tests for their diagnosis. Doctors diagnose them by just looking at them and knowing their history.''To know the details of the skin hemangioma, the doctor may order an ''ultrasound''. Suspicion of head and neck hemangiomas may need ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') to confirm the diagnosis.' "
What is the treatment for hemangioma?,"'Doctors generally recommend observing the hemangiomas as most of them subside on their own without any treatment. This requires a few follow-ups with the doctor. Only if the hemangiomas are multiple or cause vision problems, such as hemangiomas near the eye, treatment will be required.' Beta-blocker drugs: Small, superficial hemangiomas can be treated with the local application of timolol gel or timolol drops. Another beta-blocker, propranolol (available as a liquid) can also be given by mouth to shrink the hemangioma if the local gel does not work. Steroids: This is the second line of therapy for patients who do not respond to beta-blocker drugs. Steroids can be injected into the hemangioma. Laser therapy: Laser therapy is another option to remove the hemangioma or treat the scars. Surgery: Hemangiomas in the internal organs of the body require surgery if they grow large or become painful."
What are the complications of hemangioma?,"'Complications of hemangioma are rare. A possible complication is ulcer formation. This ulcer can bleed or cause infection.''Hemangiomas located in the internal organs, such as the ''lungs'', can cause difficulty in ''breathing''. Hemangiomas in the brain may cause ''headache'' and neurological disturbances and hemangiomas in the eye can cause vision disturbances.' "
Do I have a cold sore or canker sore?,"'Having a ''cold sore'' or ''canker sore'' is painful and differentiating them\xa0isn’t always easy. However, a\xa0''cold'' sore\xa0isn’t the same as a\xa0''canker sore''. The simplest way to differentiate between ''cold sores'' and ''canker sores'' is by location. ''Cold sores'' are usually on the outside of the mouth, typically directly on the lips, whereas ''canker sores'' are always on the inside of the mouth.' Cold sores/fever blisters: These are caused by  a type of infection and they are very contagious and quite painful. They usually start as tiny blisters clustered together that break and create a sore. The early blisters are red and full of fluid. Eventually, these have a crusted appearance. Cold sores develop on the outside of the lips but may also appear on the gums, tongue and/or on the roof of the mouth. Canker sores: These are a type of mouth ulcer and may be relatively small. They have a red border and a white or yellow center. These are usually found on soft parts of the mouth such as the inner cheeks, inner lips or at the base of your gums."
What should I know about cold sores?,"'Cold sores are usually caused by the ''herpes'' virus and it is highly contagious.''Symptoms of cold sores include''Lesions are commonly preceded by an ''itching'', burning or tingling sensation. The lesions are often painful and can come back on a regular basis. They might be triggered by exposure to sunlight, local injury, ''allergies'', ''stress'', hormonal changes or an illness such as a bout of ''fever'' or ''flu''. The infection usually heals within 7 to 10 days.''Treatment of cold sores\xa0''There is no cure available for the herpes virus; however, symptoms may be treated' High fever Difficulty swallowing General soreness in the mouth Swollen glands and fatigue (during first cold sore outbreak) Applying over-the-counter topical antiviral ointments and creams may shorten the healing process. A dab of cortisone cream may also help reduce swelling. Applying ice to the cold sore after it has appeared on the mouth can numb the area and lessen the pain as well. In rare cases, doctors may also prescribe oral antiviral medication to manage outbreaks of cold sores, especially if the patient has other health conditions, such as cancer, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) or an autoimmune disorder. These medications include famciclovir, acyclovir and valacyclovir. Cold sores usually go away within 10 days. However, it is recommended to avoid kissing or sharing drinks with anyone during an outbreak because the herpes virus is most easily transmitted."
What should I know about canker sores?,"'Canker sores are ''mouth ulcers'' that are not contagious. They are autoimmune in nature. Some may be due to repeated ''trauma'' to the lining of the mouth. For example, biting the inside of our own cheek could wind up as a canker sore because the body tries to heal the ''wound''. You\xa0 may be likely to bite the same spot inside your mouth several times making the canker sore more severe.''Symptoms of canker sores include''Treatment of canker sores\xa0''Canker sores are not easy to treat' Severe pain in the mouth and one or more sores on the mouth. Sores are usually small and rarely become large. They bleed easily, usually while brushing the teeth. They usually last for 14 to 18 days. They are usually associated with physical or emotional stress, become painful and commonly come back in multiple areas. They are triggered due to vitamin deficiency, injury, infection, spicy foods, poor diet, hormone fluctuations and even allergies.  Very rarely, canker sores are caused by a viral infection that includes fever as a symptom. They usually heal with over-the-counter pain medication or a numbing topical gel to treat the pain (benzocaine or hydrogen peroxide). Sometimes, doctors may even prescribe oral steroids to treat canker sores. Gargling with warm salt water or a solution of baking soda and water can shorten healing time and reduce pain as well. Using ice or honey may also numb the pain. Canker sores usually go away within 10 days, but if they last more than 14 days immediate medical attention may be required. Staying away from highly acidic or spicy foods and eating a diet rich in vitamins and nutrients may prevent recurrence. Sometimes, a toothpaste with sodium lauryl sulfate may trigger canker sores; trying a toothpaste without sodium lauryl sulfate may prevent recurrence."
What are the signs and symptoms of head lice?,"'You suspect a head lice infestation when you feel something crawling on your scalp and experience intense ''itching'' without even having dandruff. Other signs and symptoms of head lice include:''Some people may also get:' Sighting bugs on the scalp (look like light-brown sesame seeds) Finding lice eggs or nits (the eggs are yellow, brown, and about the size of a pinhead) Swelling in the neck (swollen lymph nodes) Pink eye (a common eye infection)"
Who gets head lice?,"'Anyone can get head lice but people at greater risk include' Children in preschool and elementary school. Children can spread the lice to their classmates, parents, and others in their households. Girls seem more likely than boys to get head lice. Girls tend to have more frequent head-to-head contact than boys do."
How do you get lice? , 
How do you get rid of lice fast? ,"'Lice cannot go away on their own. Aggressive treatment is needed to eradicate them, which takes around 4 to 6 weeks. You cannot get rid of lice as fast as dandruff.''There are several over the counter products to get rid of head lice and their nits. Here are a few steps you should follow until you get rid of the lice:''If all this seems troublesome, another treatment option is to shave the scalp and go bald.''Alternatively, you can visit a dermatologist who will most likely give you any of the following prescription medicines:''Whether you are self-treating yourself or getting treated by a dermatologist, make sure you wash your clothes, towels, or bed-sheets in hot water.' Step 1: Use a lice shampoo. This usually involves lathering the lice shampoo into the hair and leaving the shampoo on for a few minutes before rinsing it off under a shower. This can be done twice or thrice a week. Step 2. Use a lice comb: The lice comb usually comes with the shampoo. The closely arranged short teeth of the lice comb make it easier to remove the lice while combing from the hair root to the hair tip. This should always be done once every day till you see all your hair free from the lice and its eggs. Benzyl alcohol solution Ivermectin lotion Malathion lotion Spinoside suspension Lindane shampoo"
Do rice cakes make you gain weight?,"'It is possible that rice cakes may make you gain weight. This is especially true if you eat several at a time and top them with unhealthy things.''Rice cakes are a snack\xa0food. They are disk-shaped products made of puffed rice (white or brown). They are low in calories (35 to 40 kcal per cake). Other minor ingredients, such as\xa0sesame seed,\xa0millet and salt may be added to give them a distinct flavor or consistency.''The low-calorie count of rice cakes may be a bonus, but they are not the best weight-loss food. Rice cakes digest quickly since they are devoid of a significant amount of ''fiber''. The spike in blood ''sugar'' and ''insulin'' levels after ingestion of rice may cause ''weight gain''. Rice cakes may not give a feeling of satiety if a person is just eating one or two rice cakes. Some flavored rice cakes also have added sugars, salt, calories and artificial ingredients. Choose rice cakes made with brown or whole-grain rice because these will be more filling. Carbs can make an individual hungry, so combine rice cakes with a protein source, such as ham, low-fat cream cheese with smoked salmon or a little peanut butter. The nutritional value of rice cakes depends on how an individual is eating them.' Plain rice cakes may be topped with just honey, hummus, avocado and veggies. Eating them with nut butter or hummus can up the nutritional intake and slow down the release of sugar into the bloodstream. Top rice crackers with tuna or tomato rather than Vegemite or jam to stabilize blood sugar levels and control appetite. Look for the healthier ones made from whole grains and seeds, which increase the fiber and nutrient content. Rice cakes with whole grains, seeds and seaweed make them higher in fiber, nutrients and taste than traditional white cakes."
What are the advantages of including rice cakes in the diet?,"'The advantages of including rice cakes in the ''diet'' may vary depending on brand and other artificially added flavors.' Rice cakes may be a great alternative to  high-calorie and high-fat snacks. Rice cakes have become a staple diet food. They are large, round, crunchy and bland. They promise a quick snack that can satisfy cravings without the guilt. Rice cakes are a high source of carbs and are low in fat. To make them a tempting food for children, you can dunk rice cakes in milk and eat them with a scoop of ice -cream. Rice cakes are also considered a good snack because they are usually cheap and easily available. They are easy to store and most people use them as emergency snacks or for desk lunches. Rice cakes are a good calorie alternative to bread. When kick starting a weight loss program, rice cakes make for an easy bread alternative. Most people consider rice cakes to be a safe diet food because they do not have fat or many calories. They tend to be free from saturated fat. The total calories will vary based on the brand and type of rice cake. In general, one rice cake tends to have 60 to 70 calories. People on a diet often eat these cakes to fight cravings for crunchy foods, such as chips. They are usually gluten free, so they don’t cause bloating or indigestion. Rice cakes are an easily digestible food with the main component being starch."
What are the disadvantages of including rice cakes in the diet?,"'The disadvantages of including rice cakes in diet include\xa0''If an individual wants to try rice cakes as a snack, they may top them with some peanut butter, cream cheese or another spread that contains fat and protein, so that blood glucose levels do not spike. Avoid rice cakes with added ''corn'' syrup, honey, sucrose or fructose.' Rice is a high glycemic index grain even when it's eaten as a whole grain (brown), so it may spike blood sugar levels. Some brands add sugar or corn syrup to their rice cakes. Most rice cakes do contain added salt. Individuals at risk for heart disease should reduce their intake of sodium and limit the intake of rice cakes. They are not nutrient-dense foods and are not considered a healthy replacement. Even though their primary ingredient is whole-grain brown rice, rice cakes are low in total nutritional value. The preparatory process makes rice cakes difficult to digest physically and chemically. Rice cakes  become hard and sticky when cold and they are not easily dissolved in hot water."
What is Sativa?,"'Cannabis is an annual, flowering herb that includes three different species:''Cannabis sativa or Sativa is tall, pale green color herbs that constitute a group of a substance known as cannabinoids. Cannabinoids are mainly of two types:''Cannabis is the most widely illegally used drug in the world and is associated with various ''mental health'' issues. The leaves, seeds, stems, or roots are mainly used for intoxication purposes.' Cannabis sativa Cannabis indica Cannabis ruderalis Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) Cannabidiol (CBD)"
What diseases does cannabis treat?,'Cannabis (cannabinoids/combination of multiple cannabis products) is not approved for the treatment of any disease. Individual products of cannabis may be useful in treating the following health conditions:' A rare form of epilepsy called Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome Nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy Dronabinol (a purified cannabis compound) is also used to treat loss of appetite and weight loss in people with HIV/AIDS Chronic pain (especially cancer pain) Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Movement disorders due to Tourette syndrome Multiple sclerosis Posttraumatic stress disorder Sleep problems
What are the side effects of cannabis?,"'Cannabis, when inhaled, exhibits short-term and long-term effects on the brain, which include:''Short term effects:''After ''smoking'' cannabis, THC passes from the ''lungs'' into the bloodstream, where it is carried to the brain and other organs. The effect occurs after 30 minutes to 1 hour. THC activates parts of the brain, which results in intoxication. Other effects include:''Long-term effects result in some permanent changes to the brain, such as losing mental abilities and functioning.''Other physical changes seen are:' Altered senses Distorted sense of time Mood swings Impaired memory Hallucinations Delusions Psychosis (disconnected from reality) Impaired coordination Fear Anxiety Difficulty in thinking clearly Increased appetite Breathing problems and lung damage Increased chances of cardiovascular diseases Liver damage Problems with child development during and after pregnancy Increased chances of developing schizophrenia and mood disorders in the future"
What are the treatments for cannabis addiction?,"'Cannabis ''addiction'' is mostly treated in a rehabilitation center. Behavioral therapies, which are successful in treating dependence include:''Although medications may be less effective in treating addictions; however, some ''antidepressant'' medications may help in managing withdrawal symptoms and preventing relapse.' Motivational enhancement therapy (MET): Motivates the individual to give up on marijuana addiction. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): Teaches the user to stop using the drugs and ways to avoid or manage other problems. Contingency management (CM): Involves exchanging vouchers as a reward for not taking drugs."
What is arthritis?,"'Arthritis refers to the inflammation of one or more joints in the body. Arthritis generally presents with ''joint pain'', swelling, ''stiffness'' and warm feeling, and red skin over the affected joint.\xa0''There are many types of arthritis and their underlying cause varies depending on the type of arthritis. ''Osteoarthritis'' and ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (''RA'') are two of the common types of arthritis. Osteoarthritis occurs due to the wear and tear associated with age or injuries. ''Rheumatoid arthritis'' or ''RA'' is caused by an autoimmune phenomenon, which means that the body’s immune system in ''RA'' attacks the normal lining of the joints causing arthritis.''Some of the other types of arthritis are:' Psoriatic arthritis: An inflammatory condition that mainly affects the skin and joints. Juvenile arthritis: It affects children and teens. Gout: A disease in which defective uric acid metabolism causes arthritis. Reactive arthritis: A joint inflammation triggered by an infection in another part of the body, such as bowel, genitals, or urinary tract. Infectious arthritis: A sudden and painful arthritis due to joint infection. Lupus: A long-term condition that affects various parts of the body including the skin and joints. Ankylosing spondylitis: An inflammatory condition affecting the spine and large joints."
What are the risk factors for arthritis?,"'The triggers for arthritis may vary according to the type of the disease. Most types of arthritis do not have a known cause. Studies, however, have revealed the role of three major factors in certain types of arthritis:''Several factors may increase a person’s risk for arthritis:' Genetic (inherited) factors causing some types of arthritis to run in families Physical activity and diet Presence of other medical conditions, such as infections and chronic diseases like lupus Age: The risk of getting arthritis, particularly osteoarthritis, increases with age. Age may also worsen the symptoms of arthritis. Gender: Arthritis generally affects women more than men. Weight: Being obese or overweight puts extra stress on the joints that support an individual’s weight. Increased weight beyond the normal range for a person’s age and height increases joint wear and tear and the risk of arthritis. Occupation: Certain jobs may involve the worker to keep doing the same movements repeatedly. These include jobs where one needs to do heavy lifting or repeated fine work as done by musicians. It can cause joint stress and/or an injury, which may lead to arthritis. Injury: Joint injury or trauma may cause osteoarthritis. Autoimmune diseases: These may misdirect the immune system towards the joints as seen in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Infections: Certain infections may lead to joint inflammation as seen in tubercular arthritis and septic arthritis."
When do tongue lacerations need stitching?,'Following injuries of the tongue require surgical repair:' Bisecting wounds Persistent bleeding of the wound Large flaps Wounds to the tip of the tongue  Wounds with a large gap Wounds larger than 1-2 cm U-shaped lacerations Avulsion or amputation of the tongue 
What causes tongue lacerations?,'Some common causes of tongue lacerations are as follows:' A fall Tongue bites while chewing or during a seizure episode Blunt or penetrating injuries Piercings Intoxication Self-mutilation Anesthesia Surgery of the oral cavity An explosion of electronic cigarettes Chemicals Physical abuse
How is the tongue surgically repaired?,"'Major injuries of the tongue may require emergency medical care and surgical intervention. Major injuries of the tongue can cause severe bleeding and swelling, affecting speech, swallowing, and breathing.''During surgery:''The patient is first given sedation and numbing medicine, after which the surgeon carefully inspects the wound.''The surgeon would also check for other oral cavity injuries, chipped, or missing ''teeth''. Tooth fragments may be lodged inside the wound. If not removed, it can lead to infection. The surgeon will consider obtaining radiographic imaging to locate missing tooth fragments.\xa0The wound may be contaminated with bacteria and debris and hence would be thoroughly cleaned by the surgeon. The tongue is stabilized. The lacerations are usually closed in one, two, or three layers. Suturing the muscular layer of the tongue can control bleeding sufficiently, and the function of the tongue is restored. The superficial mucosal layers of the tongue usually heal rapidly.''After surgery:''Painkillers, anti-inflammatory medications, and antibiotics are usually administered.''The patient is advised ''cold'', icy foods in the first one to two days, such as ice cream, cold milkshakes, cold water, or sucking on ice cubes.''The patient should eat a soft ''diet'' for two to three days until the ''pain'' and swelling reduce.''The patient would be advised to gargle with hydrogen peroxide or chlorohexidine diluted with water.''Healing occurs very rapidly, usually within a week.'

What are the complications following surgical tongue repair?,'Complications can include the following:' Infection Bleeding  Swelling  Disfigurement  Difficulty in speech Difficulty in chewing and swallowing  Blockage of the airway
What is sleep paralysis?,"'Have you ever had an experience during the early hours of the morning when you just woke up and found yourself unable to speak or move?\xa0''There may be other sensations along with this brief “paralytic” experience like ''spotting'' a scary creature near you, ''hearing'' strange sounds, or smelling weird odors. This frightening experience lasts for no more than a few minutes, after which you can move and speak. If yes, then what you experienced is called ''sleep paralysis''.\xa0''Sleep'' ''paralysis'' is the complete inability to move for one or two minutes immediately after awakening. Episodes of ''sleep'' paralysis can be alarming because the immobility may be accompanied by ''hallucinations'' (strange smells or images) or a sensation of suffocation. The feeling of suffocation may be related to a slight reduction in lung capacity to exchange gases.\xa0''Sleep paralysis is a type of sleep disorder that typically occurs when you are either falling asleep or waking up. During both of these times, you are in a stage of sleep where although your eyes are closed but moving in all directions. This is REM or rapid eye movement sleep and your muscles are relaxed at this time.\xa0' "
How do you get out of sleep paralysis?,"'Unfortunately, there is no prescribed way to snap out of sleep paralysis. You need to remember, however, that the condition is transient and you will be out of the experience within a few seconds. You can try to remind yourself that it is a harmless experience and focus on some good memory or a small prayer that calms you. You can, however, prevent the episodes of sleep paralysis in the following ways:' Manage stress using meditation/yoga/listening to calming music Do regular exercise, but avoid exercising right before bedtime Practice a regular schedule of going to bed at the same time and waking up at the same time every day Avoid sleeping on your back as it has been linked to the condition If you are experiencing depression or anxiety, take help from a health professional Avoid taking naps"
Do you hallucinate during sleep paralysis?,"'Some people may experience hallucinations during sleep paralysis. The hallucinations may last from a few seconds to a few minutes. Researchers suggest that the cause of these hallucinations may be a transient and harmless neurological disturbance.\xa0''The hallucinations can include:' A fearful apprehension (feeling that something bad will happen) A sensation that someone is in the bedroom Feeling that someone or something is there on your chest or choking you Spotting a “demon in the room:” An image of a frightening creature like a ghost, monster, witch, or demon near you"
What causes sleep paralysis?,"'The reasons behind why and how sleep paralysis occurs are not well understood. Researchers say that sleep paralysis occurs due to interruptions in the ''REM sleep'' cycles. Anybody can get sleep paralysis; however, some conditions may make a person more prone:' Narcolepsy (a sleep disorder that is characterized by excessive sleepiness, sleep attacks, sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and sudden loss of muscle control) Depression Anxiety Panic disorder Stress Lack of sleep Family history of sleep paralysis Disrupted sleeping pattern (shift work or jet lag)"
Do you need to see a doctor for sleep paralysis?,'Recurrent isolated sleep paralysis is fairly common. It should not affect your sleep or health. Talk to your doctor if episodes of sleep paralysis make you anxious. You should see a sleep specialist if the episodes keep you up at night or make you feel tired in the daytime. Treatment of sleep paralysis is aimed at its root cause.' Sleep deprivation may trigger sleep paralysis. Getting at least six to eight hours of sleep per night may help. People with psychiatric issues may suffer from sleep paralysis. An example is someone who has bipolar disorder. This person would need to be treated for bipolar disorder treatment with medication.  People with narcolepsy (a sleep disorder) often have sleep paralysis. They need antidepressant medication to reduce or eliminate dream sleep. Taking an antidepressant drug does not mean that you are depressed. It is simply a method to help reduce sleep paralysis.
Do you have to drain a subungual hematoma?,"'A subungual ''hematoma'' is bleeding under the nail. A doctor will drain your subungual hematoma only if''If blood is spontaneously draining from the hematoma, drainage of subungual hematoma is generally not required.''You should not try draining your subungual hematoma at home as improper drainage may result in infections or permanent damage to the nail bed.' It is causing discomfort or pain. It occupies less than 50% of the area of the nail surface."
What is subungual hematoma?,"'A subungual hematoma is a collection of blood underneath the nail (in the nail bed) caused by nail injuries. The injuries rupture the capillaries and cause leakage of the blood under the nail bed. These injuries can be due to''Runner’s toe is a good example of a subungual hematoma. A runner’s toe is a condition that commonly occurs in marathon runners due to the slamming of the toes against the shoes while ''running''.' Fall of a heavy object on the finger or toe The finger or toe getting hit by an object, such as a hammer The finger or toe getting slammed in a house door"
What are the signs and symptoms of subungual hematoma?,"'A subungual hematoma is easy to identify by its appearance. Its signs and symptoms include' Red, maroon or purplish color of the nail bed that changes to dark brown and then black Throbbing pain due to pressure of the collected blood on the nail bed The nail becomes sore or painful to the touch The pain usually resolves a few days after the injury"
How do you treat a subungual hematoma at home?,'Treating a subungual hematoma at home is simple. Here is what you can do' Keep the affected hand or foot elevated (reduces the swelling). Apply ice wrapped in a cloth over the affected finger/toe. Compress the nail by wrapping a tight bandage around it (reduces the bleeding). Take over-the-counter analgesics to relieve the pain.
When should you seek medical treatment for subungual hematoma?,"'Sometimes, a subungual hematoma may not get resolved with home treatment. You need to seek medical treatment if''If your ''wound'' is very deep or there are lacerations in the surrounding skin of the subungual hematoma, your doctor may suture the wound. They may also ask for an X-ray to check if there are any broken bones in the finger or toe.' The bleeding does not stop The pain worsens The nail bed has been severely damaged"
How is a subungual hematoma drained?,"'The procedure to drain a subungual hematoma is known as trephination. This is done by using a sharp instrument to pierce the nail. Multiple holes may be made to facilitate adequate drainage.''Before the procedure, the doctor will apply an antiseptic solution, such as Povidone-''iodine'' over the nail. They may numb the area to be drained by injecting local anesthetic medicine. The drainage can be done by any of the techniques mentioned below''Next, the doctor will apply an antibiotic cream over the nail and cover it with a small bandage. Splinting may be done in case there is a ''fracture''.''It is necessary to keep the splint and the wound dry.''The nail may fall off during the week after the hematoma drainage but will regrow in 8 weeks (fingernail) to 6 months (toenail). It may take longer if the nail bed has been severely damaged.' Needle: A medical needle is used to make a hole in the nail. Electrocautery: A heated wire is pressed on the nail to penetrate the nail. Paper clip: The sharp end of the paper clip is heated and pressed on the nail to pierce it."
What happens if subungual hematoma goes untreated?,"'A subungual hematoma usually resolves on its own without any treatment. The discoloration disappears as the nail grows. Over several months, a new nail eventually grows to replace the damaged nail.''After the subungual hematoma, the nail may even fall off followed by nail regrowth.''Remember that you may get a permanent nail deformity despite seeing and receiving treatment from your\xa0 doctor.' "
What is tetanus?,"'Tetanus'', sometimes called ''lockjaw'', is a rare disease caused by bacteria known as ''Clostridium tetani''. A toxin produced by the bacteria affects the function of the nerves and leads to severe ''muscle spasms'' in the abdomen, neck, stomach, and extremities.''The bacteria that cause tetanus can be found in soil, manure, or dust. They infect humans by entering the body through ''cuts'' or ''puncture wounds'', particularly when the ''wound'' area is dirty. Animal bites, ''burns'', and non-sterile injection of ''drugs'' can also lead to infection with ''Clostridium tetani''. The first symptoms of tetanus can appear any time from 3 days to weeks after infection, but the average time until symptom onset is 8 days. Tetanus is not ''contagious'', so you cannot acquire the disease from someone who has it.' Tetanus can either be localized to one part of the body or generalized, with muscle spasms throughout the body. The disease has been called lockjaw since the muscle spasms in the face and neck can lead to the inability to open the mouth, and this is one of the most common symptoms of tetanus. Tetanus is a serious illness that is fatal in up to 30% of cases."
When should you get a tetanus shot? How long does it last?,"'DTap and Tdap vaccination schedule is:''If it has been more than 10 years since your last tetanus booster, contact your doctor to bring your immunizations up to date. A booster vaccination is also recommended if you sustain a deep, contaminated wound and more than 5 years have passed since the last dose, since protective antibody levels may fall after 5 years in some people. You should also receive a series of three tetanus immunizations if you did not receive the childhood vaccine.''Because the levels of antitoxin in the body gradually fall over time, booster ''vaccinations'' with the combined ''diphtheria''-tetanus toxoid (Td) are recommended every 10 years. Td is a tetanus-diphtheria vaccine given to adolescents and adults as a booster shot every 10 years or after a presumed exposure in some cases, while Tdap is a similar vaccine that also contains protection against ''pertussis''\xa0(''whooping cough'').' Infants are commonly given the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) vaccine in a schedule of four doses at 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months of age. Another dose is administered at 4 to 6 years of age. A single dose of Tdap is recommended for children at the 11- to 12-year-old checkup."
What are abbreviations for the tetanus shot?," Tetanus immunization is almost always administered to children in the form of the DTaP vaccine, which also protects against diphtheria and pertussis (whooping cough). Tetanus toxoid can also be given in combination with diphtheria vaccine alone in both adult (Td) and pediatric (DT) formulations."
What are possible reactions and side effects of a tetanus shot?,"  Serious adverse reactions from the tetanus shot are very rare. Mild reactions include localized swelling, tenderness, and redness at the injection site that generally persist for 1-2 days after vaccination."
What is the effectiveness of the tetanus shot?,"'The tetanus vaccine is a toxoid, meaning that it protects against the toxin produced by the bacteria. Developed in the 1920s, tetanus vaccination became routinely used as a part of childhood immunizations in the U.S. after World War II, and it is considered to be essentially 100% effective in preventing tetanus.'

Do you suture a lip laceration?,"'Children often end up getting minor ''cuts'' on their lips in the form of wounds or lacerations while playing, especially when they fall on the ground. Since the face has a lot of blood supply, any cut causes the lips to bleed more and for a longer time compared to cuts on other areas unless measures are taken to stop the bleeding.''The problem with lip lacerations is that even if they are small, they are easily visible and tend to form ''scars''. These wounds may need suturing to keep the borders even and reduce the development of scars. Cuts inside the lips usually do not require ''stitches'' as they heal at the normal speed.' "
What are the self-care tips for lip lacerations?,"'Most lip lacerations can be treated at home. Here are a few self-care tips that you can follow immediately''Other things to do include' Calm your child and reassure them that the pain will go away. Apply pressure with a cloth for a few minutes (to stop the bleeding). Wash the laceration with soap and water and hold it under running water to remove the dirt. If the wound is inside the lip, rinse the area well with cool water for several minutes. Do not rub or scrub the laceration. Do not blow on the wound. Apply an antiseptic cream, such as Povidone-iodine on the laceration. Give your child an ice cube or ice pops to suck on to reduce the pain and inflammation. Keep the lacerated lip dry and clean. Keep checking for changes in the laceration. Apply a sunscreen or a sun-protectant lip balm on the healed laceration. Hold a cold pack to the swollen lips every 1 to 2 hours for 10 to 15 minutes for the first 24 hours."
When do you need medical attention for lip laceration?,"'Given the risk of ''scar'' formation, it is very important to seek medical counsel for any facial injury.''You need to visit the doctor immediately if the laceration''Get your child a ''tetanus'' shot from the doctor if it has not been given to them within the last 5 years.''Lip wounds are more likely to become infected than other wounds due to the saliva and contamination from dental bacterial plaque.

Exercise Stress Test Introduction,'A ''stress'' test can be used to test for ''heart disease''. ''Stress'' tests are tests performed by a doctor and/or trained technician to determine the amount of stress that your ''heart'' can manage before developing either an abnormal rhythm or evidence of ischemia (not enough blood flow to the heart muscle). The most commonly performed stress test is the ''exercise'' stress test.' 
What Is an Exercise Stress Test?,"'The ''exercise'' stress test -- also called a stress test, exercise ''electrocardiogram'', treadmill test, graded exercise test, or stress ''ECG'' -- is a test used to provide information about how the heart responds to exertion. It usually involves ''walking'' on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike at increasing levels of difficulty, while your electrocardiogram, heart rate, and ''blood pressure'' are monitored.' "
Why Do I Need a Stress Test?,'Your doctor uses the stress test to:' Determine if there is adequate blood flow to your heart during increasing levels of activity. Evaluate the effectiveness of your heart medications to control angina and ischemia. Determine the likelihood of having coronary heart disease and the need for further evaluation. Check the effectiveness of procedures done to improve blood flow within the heart vessels in people with coronary heart disease. Identify abnormal heart rhythms. Help you develop a safe exercise program.
What Types of Stress Tests Are There?,"'There are many different types of stress tests, including:''Preparation for these types of stress tests will vary from preparation for the exercise stress test. Ask your doctor about any specific instructions.' Dobutamine or Adenosine Stress Test: This test is used in people who are unable to exercise. A drug is given to make the heart respond as if the person were exercising. This way the doctor can still determine how the heart responds to stress, but no exercise is required. Stress echocardiogram: An 
echocardiogram (often called ""echo"") is a graphic outline of the heart's movement. A stress echo can accurately visualize the motion of the heart's walls and pumping action when the heart is stressed; it may reveal a lack of blood flow that isn't always apparent on other heart tests. Nuclear stress test: This test helps to determine which parts of the heart are healthy and function normally and which are not. A very small and harmless amount of radioactive substance is injected into the patient. Then the doctor uses a special camera to identify the rays emitted from the substance within the body; this produces clear pictures of the heart tissue on a monitor. These pictures are done both at rest and after exercise. Using this technique, a less than normal amount of thallium will be seen in those areas of the heart that have a decreased blood supply."
How Should I Prepare for the Exercise Stress Test?," Do not eat or drink anything except water for four hours before the test. Do not drink or eat foods containing caffeine for 12 hours before the test. Caffeine will interfere with the results of your test. Do not take the following heart medications on the day of your test unless your doctor tells you otherwise, or if the medication is needed to treat chest discomfort the day of the test: Isosorbide dinitrate (for example, Isordil, Dilatrate SR); Isosorbide mononitrate (for example, ISMO, Imdur, Monoket); Nitroglycerin (for example, Deponit, Nitrostat, Nitro-bid). Your doctor may also ask you to stop taking other heart medications on the day of your test. If you have any questions about your medications, ask your doctor. Do not discontinue any medication without first talking with your doctor. If you use an inhaler for your breathing, please bring it to the test."
What If I have Diabetes?," If you take insulin to control your blood sugar, ask your doctor what amount of your medication you should take the day of the test. Often, you will take only half of your usual morning dose and eat a light meal 4 hours before the test. If you take pills to control your blood sugar, do not take your medication until after the test is complete. Do not take your diabetes medication and skip a meal before the test. If you own a glucose monitor, bring it with you to check your blood sugar levels before and after your exercise stress test. If you think that your blood sugar is low, tell the lab personnel immediately. Plan to eat and take your blood sugar medication following your stress test."
What Should I Wear the Day of the Test?,"'On the day of your stress test, wear soft-soled shoes suitable for walking and comfortable clothes. Do not bring valuables.' "
What Happens During the Exercise Stress Test?,"'First, during a stress test, a technician will gently clean 10 small areas on your chest and place electrodes (small, flat, sticky patches) on these areas. The electrodes are attached to an electrocardiograph monitor (ECG or ''EKG'"") that charts your heart's electrical activity during the test.""'Before you start exercising, the technician will perform an EKG, to measure your heart rate at rest and will take your blood pressure.''You will begin to exercise by walking on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bicycle. The rate of exercise, or degree of difficulty will gradually increase. You will be asked to exercise until you feel exhausted.''At regular intervals, the lab personnel will ask how you are feeling. Please tell them if you feel chest, arm or ''jaw pain'' or discomfort, short of breath, dizzy, lightheaded, or any other unusual symptoms. It is normal for your heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and ''perspiration'' to increase during the test. The lab personnel will watch for any symptoms or changes on the ECG monitor that suggest the test should be stopped.''After the test you will walk or pedal slowly for a couple of minutes to cool down. Your heart rate, blood pressure and ECG will continue to be monitored until the levels begin returning to normal.''Although the appointment lasts about 60 minutes, the actual exercise time is usually between seven and 12 minutes.''Ask your doctor if you have any questions about the exercise stress test.' "
What is coronary heart disease?,"'Coronary ''heart disease'' or''coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'') is  ''atherosclerosis'' (plaque in artery walls) of the inner lining of the blood vessels that supply blood to the ''heart''. A similar term, ''arteriosclerosis'' which means hardening or stiffening of the arteries is sometimes interchanged with atherosclerosis by some authors. Coronary ''heart disease'' is a common form of ''heart disease'' and is a major cause of illness and death. Coronary heart disease begins when hard ''cholesterol'' substances (plaques) are deposited within a coronary artery. The coronary arteries arise from the ''aorta'', which is adjacent to the heart. The plaques narrow the internal diameter of the arteries (Figure1) which may cause a tiny clot to form which can obstruct the flow of blood to the heart muscle (Figure 2). Symptoms of coronary heart disease include:'  chest pain (angina pectoris) from inadequate blood flow to the heart;  heart attack, from the sudden total blockage of a coronary artery; or  sudden death, due to a fatal rhythm disturbance. "
What is the purpose of screening tests for coronary heart disease?,"'In many individuals, the first symptom of coronary heart disease is heart attack or sudden death, with no preceding ''chest pain'' as a warning. For this reason, doctors perform screening tests to detect signs of coronary heart disease before serious medical events occur so the tests are designed to detect plaque (Figure 1) before a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (Figure 2). Screening tests are of particular importance for people with risk factors for coronary heart disease. These risk factors include a family history of coronary heart disease at relatively young ages, an abnormal serum cholesterol profile,''cigarette smoking'', elevated ''blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), and ''diabetes mellitus''. '  "
"What are common initial screening tests for 
coronary heart disease?","'EKG'' (''Electrocardiogram'', ECC)''An electrocardiogram (EKG, ECC) usually is the first and most simple test used to look for any coronary heart disease signs. Unless the person is actively having a heart attack, which often is seen as an electrical change in the heart rhythm (ST segment elevation), the EKG may show electrical changes such as ST depressions or Q waves that suggest the patient has coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease with signs of a previous heart attack. An EKG often encourages the physician to proceed with initial screening test(s).''Initial screening for coronary heart disease commonly involves stressing the heart under controlled conditions. These ''stress'' tests are able to detect the presence of flow-limiting blockages in the coronary arteries, generally in the range of at least a 50% reduction in the diameter of at least one of the three major coronary arteries. There are two basic types of ''stress'' tests; those that involve exercising the patient to stress the heart (''exercise'' cardiac stress tests), and those that involve chemically stimulating the heart directly to mimic the stress of ''exercise'' (physiologic stress testing). Physiologic stress testing can be used for patients who are unable to exercise.' "
Exercise cardiac stress test (treadmill stress test or ECST),"'Exercise cardiac stress testing'"" (ECST) is the most widely used cardiac stress test. The patient exercises on a treadmill according to a standardized protocol, with progressive increases in the speed and elevation of the treadmill (typically changing at three minute intervals). During the ECST, the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG), heart rate, heart rhythm, and blood pressure are continuously monitored. If a coronary arterial blockage results in decreased blood flow to a part of the heart during exercise, certain changes (for example, ST segment depressions) may be observed in the EKG, as well as in the response of the heart rate and blood pressure. ""'The accuracy of the ECST in predicting significant coronary heart disease is variable, depending in part on the ""pre-test likelihood"" of coronary heart disease (also known as Bayes\' theorem). In a person at high risk for coronary heart disease (for example, advanced age, multiple coronary risk factors), an abnormal ECST is very predictive of the presence of coronary heart disease (over 90% accurate). However, a relatively normal ECST may not reflect the absence of significant disease in a person with the same risk factors. Conversely, in a person with a low-risk, a normal ECST is very predictive of the absence of significant coronary heart disease (over 90% accurate), but an abnormal test may not reflect the true presence of coronary heart disease (so-called ""false-positive ECST""). The ECST may either miss the presence of significant coronary heart disease, or be a false-positive test, due to a variety of cardiac circumstances, which may include: ''When the doctor determines that the results of the ECST do not accurately reflect the presence or absence of significant coronary heart disease, additional tests are often used to clarify the condition. These additional options include radionuclide isotope injection and ''ultrasound of the heart'' (stress ''echocardiography'') during the stress test.' An abnormal EKG at rest, which may be due to 
abnormal serum electrolytes, abnormal cardiac electrical conduction, or certain medications, such as digitalis; Heart conditions not related to coronary heart disease, such as mitral valve prolapse or hypertrophy (increased size) of the heart; or An inadequate increase in the heart rate and/or blood pressure during exercise."
Radionuclide stress test,"'Radionuclide stress testing involves injecting a radioactive isotope (typically ''thallium'"" or cardiolite) into the patient's vein after which an image of the patient's heart becomes visible with a special camera. The radioactive isotopes are absorbed by the normal heart muscle. Nuclear images are obtained in the resting condition, and again immediately following exercise. The two sets of images are then compared. During exercise, if a blockage in a coronary artery results in diminished blood flow to a part of the ""'cardiac muscle'', this region of the heart will appear as a relative ""''cold'' spot"" on the nuclear scan. This cold spot is not visible on the images that are taken while the patient is at rest (when coronary flow is adequate). Radionuclide stress testing, while more time-consuming and expensive than a simple ECST, greatly enhances the accuracy in diagnosing coronary heart disease. ' "
Stress echocardiography,"'Another supplement to the routine ECST is stress echocardiography. During stress echocardiography, the sound waves of ''ultrasound'' are used to produce images of the heart at rest and at the peak of exercise. In a heart with normal blood supply, all segments of the ''left ventricle'' (the major pumping chamber of the heart) exhibit enhanced contractions of the heart muscle during peak exercise. Conversely, in the setting of coronary heart disease, if a segment of the left ventricle does not receive optimal blood flow during exercise, that segment will demonstrate reduced contractions of heart muscle relative to the rest of the heart on the exercise ''echocardiogram''. Stress echocardiography is very useful in enhancing the interpretation of the ECST, and can be used to exclude the presence of significant coronary heart disease in patients suspected of having a ""false-positive"" ECST. ''What if a person is unable to exercise adequately for an exercise cardiac stress test?''Many people are unable to exercise maximally for stress testing due to a variety of conditions including ''arthritis'', severe lung disease, severe cardiac disease, orthopedic conditions, and diseases of the nervous system. In such individuals, pharmacological stress testing is often used. ' "
Pharmacologic stress test,"'During a pharmacologic stress test, certain medications are administered which stimulate the heart to mimic the physiologic effects of exercise. One of these medications is dobutamine, which is similar to adrenaline. Dobutamine is carefully administered to gradually increase the heart rate and strength of the contractions of the heart muscle. Simultaneously, echocardiography or radionuclide imaging is performed. ''Alternatively, a medicine called adenosine is administered, which simulates the physiology of the coronary artery circulation during exercise. Adenosine is combined with radionuclide isotope imaging to provide a very accurate test for the detection of significant coronary heart disease. A newer agent, regadenoson (Lexiscan), is often used as it seems to be better tolerated. Pharmacological stress testing is commonly performed in individuals who are thought to be at high risk for significant coronary heart disease and who are scheduled for major non-cardiac surgical procedures. These people often are unable to perform exercise stress testing due to the underlying condition for which they require surgery. In this setting, pharmacological stress testing is invaluable in assessing the cardiac risk of patients prior to surgery. ' "
"Are there other tests for 
coronary heart disease that are noninvasive?","'A new noninvasive test for the detection of coronary heart disease is electron beam ''computerized tomography'"" (EBCT), or calcium scoring. Unlike the above mentioned stress tests that measure the heart's physiology, EBCT is designed to measure calcium deposits in the coronary arteries. ""'In individuals with coronary heart disease, the plaques which make up the blockages contain significant amounts of calcium, which can be detected with the CT scanner and the amount of blockage is calculated by calcium scoring. This test will identify calcium in blockages as mild as 10%-20%, which would not be detected by standard physiological testing. When such mild blockages are detected, however, the only recommended therapy is risk factor modification (cholesterol lowering and cessation of ''smoking'' if applicable), and adjunctive use of ''aspirin'' and certain ''vitamins''; such therapy would be advised in all persons with risk factors for coronary heart disease, regardless of the results of any noninvasive tests. ''Calcium scoring may be very helpful in convincing people to change their lifestyle or take their medicines, as a score that is not zero implies that the blockage process is starting, and likely will progress unless lifestyle changes are made. It is important to realize that calcification is a function of age, and in younger people (men under 50, women under 60) the calcium score is less helpful when low. ''A more elaborate modality is CT ''angiography'' (ultrafast CT). This is a non-invasive (no catheter involved) form of ''angiogram'', but still involves dye exposure and ''radiation'', and is less precise than a ''coronary angiogram''. This is still a rather new modality, and its role is still being defined.'  "
What is the most accurate method of defining coronary heart disease?,"'The ""gold standard"" for the evaluation of coronary heart disease remains the coronary angiogram. ''Coronary angiography'' can be used to identify the exact location and severity of coronary heart disease; it is described below.' "
Coronary angiography,"'During a coronary angiogram (also termed a coronary catheterization), a small catheter (a thin hollow tube with a diameter of 2-3 mm) is inserted through the skin into an artery usually in either the groin or the arm. Guided with the assistance of a fluoroscope (a special X-ray viewing instrument), the catheter is then advanced to the opening of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart. Next, a small amount of radiographic contrast (a solution containing ''iodine'', which is easily visualized with X-ray images) is injected into each coronary artery. The images that are produced are called the angiogram. ''Angiographic images accurately reveal the extent and severity of all coronary arterial blockages. Coronary angiography is performed with the use of local anesthesia and intravenous sedation, and is generally not terribly uncomfortable. The procedure takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes. After the procedure, the catheter is removed and the artery in the leg or arm is sutured, ""sealed,"" or treated with manual compression to prevent bleeding. There is a small risk of serious complications from coronary angiography, as it is an ""invasive"" test, but in the hands of experienced physicians, this risk is quite small (well below one per cent). In appropriate patients, the therapeutic information learned from the angiogram is far more valuable than the relatively small risk of the procedure.''For patients with severe ''angina'' or heart attack (''myocardial infarction''), or those who have markedly abnormal noninvasive tests for coronary heart disease, the angiogram also helps the doctor select the optimal treatment, which may include medications, ''balloon angioplasty'', coronary ''stent'' placement, or ''coronary bypass'' surgery. The coronary angiogram is the only test which allows the precise quantification of the extent and severity of coronary heart disease to optimally make these treatment decisions.' "
Conclusions,"'For the purpose of screening for coronary heart disease, each person should discuss their particular coronary heart disease ""risk factor profile"" with the doctor in order to decide if screening tests are indicated and which test is most appropriate. The doctor will have detailed information regarding what testing involves and the implications of the results for each individual.' "
What is open right hemicolectomy?,"'Right hemicolectomy (right colectomy) is the surgical removal of the right side of the colon along with the fat and surrounding ''lymph nodes''.\xa0''The colon is a long, tubelike, inverted U-shaped abdominal structure measuring about five to six inches in diameter. The right side of the colon consists of\xa0''\xa0A hemicolectomy is done if the part of the colon that has turned unhealthy or bad. It is usually performed for the following conditions:''Right hemicolectomy can be performed via the open or the laparoscopic approach:\xa0''Though the surgeon may discuss with you in advance the type of surgery suitable for you, sometimes they may convert the planned laparoscopic surgery into an emergency open surgery if he comes across an appendicular mass that seems to be cancerous.' Cecum (the first part of your colon connected to the last part of your intestine, terminal ileum) Ascending colon (the second part of your colon that runs upwards to transverse colon) Right half of the transverse colon (straight, middle part of the colon) Cancer of the right colon Polyps of the colon  Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease and sometimes ulcerative colitis) Caecal volvulus (twisting of the caecum resulting in loops) Severe appendicitis with involvement of the cecum in the inflammatory process Cancer of appendix Diverticular disease (outpouchings of the colon) Laparotomy (open surgery): A large incision is made into the abdomen to do the surgery. Laparoscopic surgery: Four to five small incisions are made into the abdomen, and a long camera (laparoscope) is inserted in one of the incisions to visualize the internal structures and perform the surgery."
What is the preparation for a right open hemicolectomy?," Your surgeon will take your complete history and examine you physically.  They will ask you to undergo computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis and X-ray of the chest.  You may be asked to undergo a test known as full colonoscopy, where a long tube-like camera will be inserted through your anus to visualize your colon. You will be counseled about the risks and complications of the surgery. You will be given an enema either on the previous night before the surgery or on the morning of the surgery. You will be advised to have only a clear-liquid diet the day before, and nothing at all for 12 hours before your operation. Only the essential medications are allowed, with a sip of water, on the morning of the procedure. Some antibiotics and fluids will be started via intravenous route (IV) on the day of procedure. A tube-like structure known as a Foley catheter will be inserted into your bladder through your urethra to collect urine."
Does a right hemicolectomy remove the appendix?," For open right hemicolectomy, an incision of about six inch is made on the right side of your abdomen. The surgeon will retrieve your right colon and cut (resect) it and then reconnect the rest of your colon end-to-end (technique called end anastomosis). In case of severe appendicitis that has affected the caecum, or in cancer of the appendix, the surgeon will also cut the appendix along with the right colon and connect what's left of your colon to your small intestine. The surgical wound will be stapled or stitched with surgical threads (sutures) and then covered with a bandage."
What happens after open right hemicolectomy?," You will be shifted to the surgical ward and monitored for several hours after the surgery. You will not be allowed to eat for 24 hours after the surgery.  Intravenous fluids and antibiotics are continued for up to 24 hours. After 24 hours, you can have clear liquids as tolerated. The Foley catheter is removed two to three days after the procedure.  You will be encouraged to walk and move around after two days. You will be shifted to a soft diet (foods that are easy to chew and swallow) as soon as you pass gas and stools. Depending upon how well you tolerate the soft diet and how fast your bowel function bounces back to normal, you will be discharged within three to seven days of your surgery. Follow-up is usually scheduled 10-14 days after discharge."
Is a hemicolectomy major surgery?,'A hemicolectomy is major surgery. You may not be able to get back to normal activities for four to six weeks or even more afterward if you suffer from any of its complications.''The possible complications of open right hemicolectomy include:' Wound infection Leaking from the reconnected colon Paralytic ileus (loss of muscle functioning of the colon)
Why is amniotomy done?,"'Amniotomy is done to:' Induce the contractions of the womb for facilitating vaginal delivery Assist in internal fetal monitoring to know the wellbeing of the fetus Speed up the process of labor Allow placement of internal monitors, such as a fetal scalp electrode or intrauterine pressure catheter Assess amniotic fluid"
How effective is amniotomy?, 
What causes prostate enlargement?,"'The ''prostate gland'' or prostate is an important part of the male reproductive system. It produces fluid that carries sperm during ejaculation. The prostate gland is situated just below the bladder and in front of the rectum (the last part of the large bowel).\xa0It surrounds the urethra (the tube through which urine passes out of the body). It is roughly the size of a walnut.''The causes of ''prostate enlargement'' are not well understood. Research suggests that ''aging'' and changes in the cells of the testicles may play some role in the enlargement of the prostate. This is supported by the fact that males, who got their testicles removed at a young age because of reasons like ''testicular cancer'', do not get BPH). Furthermore, in males with BPH, removal of the testicles causes the prostate to shrink in size. Removal of testicles, however, is not done to treat BPH since there are several other safe and effective treatment options. The chances of having an ''enlarged prostate'' increase with age. In several men over 40 years of age, a small amount of prostate enlargement is present. The condition, however, affects over 90% of the men over 80 years of age.' "
What are the symptoms of an enlarged prostate?,"'The symptoms of an ''enlarged prostate'' include:''The symptoms of prostatic enlargement need urgent medical attention as they may be due to more serious conditions, such as infections (''UTI''), kidney diseases, or prostate ''cancer''.' Frequent urination Strong and sudden urge to urinate Dribbling at the end of urinating Inability to urinate (urinary retention) Inability to empty the bladder Urinary incontinence (loss of bladder control) Nocturia (needing to urinate two or more times per night) Pain during urination or bloody urine (these may indicate infection or other serious problem) Slowed or delayed the start of the urinary stream Straining to urinate Thin or weak urine stream"
What are the common organs that are affected by COVID-19?,"'COVID-19 virus may infect multiple organs. The virus enters the cells by binding to receptors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.

What are the treatment options for COIVD-19?,"'There are currently no approved treatments for COIVD-19. ''Hydroxychloroquine'' (HCQ) is being used in mild cases and as a prophylactic drug, however, multiple large ''clinical trials'' show HCQS does not show benefits in the treatment. Below are a few other potential ''drugs'' and treatments that are being researched:' Antibiotics: Ivermectin, Doxycycline, and Azithromycin Antiviral: Favipiravir and Remdesivir Steroids: Dexamethasone and Methylprednisone Convalescent plasma therapy: An off-label therapy and may work best when given early in the treatment cycle."
What is the Nexplanon implant?,"'Nexplanon is a small, thin, flexible, and matchstick-sized ''plastic'' implant device that is placed underneath the skin of your inner upper arm. If you are right-handed, doctors place it in the left arm and vice versa. It is considered a long-acting ''birth control'' option for women, to prevent pregnancy for up to 3 years and must be removed after 3 years.''The implant continuously releases a hormone, progestin (etonogestrel), that stops an egg from being released from your ovary, prevents sperms from reaching the egg, and changes the linings of your womb. It also contains a small amount of barium sulfate for its better visibility under X-ray.' "
What happens during the implantation?,"'What happens:' To avoid infection, proper sterile methods must be used during the insertion of the implant, such as the use of hand hygiene, sterile gloves, and correct skin disinfection. A trained doctor or nurse will give local anesthetics, which will numb the part of your arm where the implant will be inserted. The doctor may mark the insertion point at 8-10 cm (3-4 inches) above the elbow of your inner side of the upper arm (especially the nondominant arm) and another point around 4 cm above as a direction guide. It only takes a few minutes to put in, feels similar to having an injection, and you do not need any stitches. After implantation, you may get bruising at the implant site, which is normal."
Who should not use Nexplanon?,'You should not use Nexplanon if you have' Pregnancy Doubt that you are pregnant Blood clots or tendency to having blood clots Liver disease Liver tumor Unexplained heavy periods Breast cancer Any other cancer that is sensitive to the progestin hormone Allergy to the content of the implant

What is liposuction?,"'Liposuction is a cosmetic procedure that is performed by a ''plastic surgeon'' to remove fat from the body, which is difficult to get rid of through ''diet'' or ''exercise''. This can be performed on the hips, abdomen, chest, thighs, buttocks, back, arms, and under the chin or face to improve their shape. Liposuction can be combined with other ''plastic'' surgeries, such as ''breast reduction'', ''tummy tuck'' (''abdominoplasty''), and facelifts. It is important to have realistic, aesthetic goals. The procedure can be done in men and women and it is one of the most popular surgeries to get rid of excess fat.' "
Who can undergo liposuction?,'Ideal candidates for liposuction are:' People with body mass index (BMI) within normal limits or at least within 30% of their normal body weight Have no plans for future pregnancies and only seek body contouring after weight loss Have firm and elastic skin
When should liposuction not be done?,"'Liposuction is not recommended in those who have systemic medical conditions like ''heart disease'', ''diabetes'', or a weak immune system. The procedure is also contraindicated in ''smokers'' since ''smoking'' delays healing.' "
How is liposuction performed?,"'Before surgery:''During surgery:''The procedure is usually performed under intravenous sedation and general anesthesia. The incisions made during the surgery are very small. A thin hollow tube is inserted through the incisions that loosen the excess fat, the fat is then dislodged and suctioned out using a surgical vacuum or syringe. The patients can usually go home the same day after the surgery or after 24 hours of surgery.''After surgery:''Painkillers and antibiotics would be administered. Patients can experience ''pain'', swelling, ''bruising'', and fluid accumulation, which usually resolves in 2 weeks, and then the new body contour will be more apparent. A compression garment or elastic bandages may be used to cover the treated areas to help to reduce swelling and compress the excess skin to the new body contours. A small temporary surgical drain may be placed in the incisions made during the surgery to excess blood or fluid. It is usually removed in 24-48 hours. Patients can return to normal activities in 2 to 3 days and return to work when comfortable after consulting with the surgeon.' The patient is advised to stop smoking Perform exercises before the surgery for overall well-being The patient is advised to be close to the desired weight The surgeon would perform a detailed physical examination, blood, and radiological investigations Consent for surgery would be obtained"
What are the complications of liposuction?,"'Liposuction is a relatively safe and commonly performed surgery with a low morbidity rate. It has a high success rate. It is important to be mindful of the contraindications, follow pre and postoperative advice, and have realistic, aesthetic goals. However, like any other surgery, there are complications. Some common complications are:' Poor wound healing Dehiscence (the cut made during a surgical procedure separates or ruptures after it has been sutured together) Bleeding Blood clot formation Infection Unsightly scarring Temporary or permanent numbness around the incision site"
Does liver cancer spread quickly?,"'Liver cancer'' can spread quickly depending on the type of ''cancer''.''Hemangiosarcoma and angiosarcoma types of ''liver'' ''cancer'' are fast spreading, whereas hepatocellular ''carcinoma'' spreads late in the disease.' "
What is liver cancer?,"'Liver ''cancer'', also known as hepatic cancer, is a type of cancer that starts in the liver. The different types of liver cancer are:' Primary liver cancer: This cancer starts in the liver. Primary liver cancer is of different types:Hepatocellular carcinoma (the common form of liver cancer)Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer)Angiosarcoma and hemangiosarcoma (cancer that begins in the cell lining of the blood vessels in the liver)Hepatoblastoma (cancer occurring in infants) Hepatocellular carcinoma (the common form of liver cancer) Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) Angiosarcoma and hemangiosarcoma (cancer that begins in the cell lining of the blood vessels in the liver) Hepatoblastoma (cancer occurring in infants) Secondary liver cancer (metastatic liver cancer): Cancer that originates in the liver and spreads to other parts. Benign liver tumors: Noncancerous tumors may grow large enough to cause problems, but they do not grow into nearby tissues."
How does one get liver cancer?,'Individuals with chronic ''liver disease'' have the highest chances of getting liver cancer. The scarring of the liver increases the chance of liver cancer.\xa0''Other contributory factors include:' Chronic hepatitis C Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease Obesity Male gender Age above 55 years High-risk ethnic background (Asian or Hispanic) Alcohol use Elevated iron content in the blood Chronic hepatitis B infection
What are the symptoms of liver cancer?,"'Symptoms are hardly seen in the initial stages. As the ''tumor'' size increases, it may cause ''pain'' in the right side of the abdomen.

How is liver cancer treated?,"'The treatment of liver cancer depends on the stage and type of liver cancer. The most common treatment options include:' Surgery: This option may be useful in removing part of the liver affected by cancer. Complications of surgery include bleeding, infection, or pneumonia. Liver transplant: This involves replacing the cancerous cells with healthy liver cells from a donor. Rejection of the liver transplant is the major complication of this method. Ablation therapy: This procedure involves using heat or laser to destroy the cancerous cells. Embolization: This technique uses a catheter to inject particles or beads into the blood vessels supplying the cancer cells to block it. This kills the cancerous cells. Radiation therapy: Radiation of high frequency destroys the cancerous cells. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy uses medications to kill cancerous cells."
How long can you survive with liver cancer?,"'Survival of the cancer patients depends on the stage of cancer. The overall survival rate of liver cancer patients is low, due to other underlying medical conditions, such as ''cirrhosis''.\xa0''Generally, a five-year survival rate for all stages of liver cancer is only 15%. However, the five-year survival rate can vary depending on the extent of cancer spread.\xa0''The five-year survival rate of cancer confined to the liver (localized liver cancer) is 28%, whereas, for cancer spread to nearby organs (regional liver cancer) and cancer spread to distant organs or tissues (distant liver cancer) is 7% and 2%, respectively.'

What is toe amputation?,"'Toe amputation is a common procedure performed by a wide variety of healthcare providers. One of the most common indications for toe amputation is patients with a diabetic foot. Most of these procedures are performed by a general or foot surgeon.\xa0''Toe amputation is usually performed as a last resort when medical treatment fails, or the toe cannot be salvaged. Systemic diseases such as ''diabetes'' and ''hypertension'' need to be managed, and they affect the blood vessels and nerves.''The method of toe amputation (disarticulation vs. osteotomy) and the level of amputation (partial or whole digit) depend on the extent of disease and anatomy. With any amputation, the degree of postoperative functional loss is usually expected and proportional to the amount of tissue amputated. The big toe is considered the most important of the toes in functional terms.' "
When is toe amputation done?,"'There are three broad indications for amputation of any body part:''A “dead” toe'' is the one in which the blood supply is so completely compromised that infarction and necrosis (tissue death) develop with a nonviable tissue turning dry and black. A “dead” toe is most commonly observed as a complication of ''diabetes'' due to ''vascular disease''. Other major risk factors for ''peripheral vascular disease'' are ''smoking'', ''hypertension'', ''hyperlipidemia'', narrowing or spasm of blood vessels, or severe ''frostbite''.''A “deadly” ''category results in systemic sequelae and can be deadly if not managed immediately. ''Malignancy'' may also require amputation, though infrequently.''A toe is a “dead loss” ''when it is diseased to the point where it is irreparable and is no longer functional.' Dead Deadly Dead loss"
When should toe amputation not be done?,"'The main contraindication for toe amputation is if the dead tissue is poorly demarcated and patchy. If the borders of the dead tissue area are unclear, the surgeon would not be able to demarcate the extent of the disease, affecting the results of surgery. Amputation of any body part is contraindicated if it results in a significant decrease in quality of life in case of a limited life expectancy.' "
How is toe amputation performed?,"'Prior to toe amputation, the surgeon performs a detailed clinical assessment and complete blood analysis. Moreover, they perform a thorough assessment of the status of nerves and blood vessels of both limbs.' The procedure is performed under anesthesia and is relatively quick.  The affected toe is completely amputated with a margin of normal, healthy tissue.  The method of toe amputation (disarticulation vs osteotomy) and the extent of amputation (partial or whole digit) depend on the extent of disease and anatomy.  The wound is left open. Dressing and wound cleaning are done regularly until the wound heals completely.  The complete recovery period from the toe amputation surgery is two to four weeks."
What are the complications of toe amputation?,"'Some common complications encountered are as follows:' Pain, swelling, and bruising Inadequate hemostasis (blood clotting), which causes bleeding  Hematoma (blood clot)  Inadequate amputation leading to spread of disease Failure to heal—this could be due to inadequate blood supply as well or due to ongoing infection Spread of infection to the rest of the body (tetanus)"
Does natural sugar count toward daily intake?,"'As per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, natural ''sugar'' does not count toward the daily intake due to the following three reasons''Natural sugars obtained from fruits and vegetables are high in ''fiber'', which reduces blood ''sugar'' spikes.''There is no report pertaining to the adverse effects of consuming sugars in fresh fruits and vegetables and sugar is naturally present in milk.''The sugars guideline is a part of the effort by the World Health Organization (WHO) to reach targets set by the Global Action Plan for noncommunicable diseases 013-2020.

The long-term survival rate is much higher if the ''tumor'' has not spread beyond the eye.' "
How do you know if a child has retinoblastoma?,"'Since retinoblastoma usually affects infants and small children, they are usually unable to explain their symptoms. The following signs in the child can indicate retinoblastoma' A white area in the pupil (the dark circular portion within the iris, the colored part of the eye), is seen when a light is shone over the eye or while taking a flash photograph. The eyes appear to be looking in different directions (lazy eye or strabismus). Redness of the eye Swelling of the eye Eye pain Bleeding in the front part of the eye Eye bulging Iris color is different in the two eyes"
What causes retinoblastoma?,"'Retinoblastoma occurs when there are genetic mutations of the nerve cells in the retina. The mutations cause the cells in the retina to grow and multiply rapidly. These cells accumulate forming a tumor. Retinoblastoma cells can invade into the eye and destroy the structure of the eye. The structures around the eye get damaged by tumor invasion. The tumor can spread to other parts of the body (''metastasis'"") and can involve the brain and spine. The exact cause of the genetic mutations causing retinoblastoma is unknown, but it's most likely ""'inherited''.''Hereditary retinoblastoma is an autosomal dominant ''genetic disorder'"" that is inherited. This means either one of the parents needs to pass on only a single copy of the mutated gene\xa0 to increase their child’s risk of retinoblastoma. If either one of the parents carries a mutated gene, there is a 50% chance that the child will inherit the gene. Though the genetic mutation increases a child's risk of retinoblastoma, it doesn't mean that the child would definitely develop ""'cancer''. Hereditary retinoblastoma usually occurs in both eyes. Children who inherit hereditary retinoblastoma may be at risk of developing other ''cancers''.' "
How is retinoblastoma treated?,"'The treatments for retinoblastoma depend on the size, location and extent of the tumor as well as the overall health of the patient. Treatment options include' Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy is a medical treatment that uses medication to kill cancer cells. They may be taken orally or intravenously (IV). Chemotherapy is also beneficial for tumors that have spread beyond the eyeball or to other parts of the body. Intravitreal chemotherapy is a type of chemotherapy where the medications are directly injected into the eyes. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy involves using high energy radiation beams, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells and shrink the tumor. Laser photocoagulation: In this therapy, a laser is used to destroy blood vessels. This cuts off the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the tumor, killing the tumor cells. Cold treatments (cryotherapy): Cryotherapy involves using a substance, such as liquid nitrogen, at an extremely low temperature to freeze and thaw the cancer cells repeatedly to kill cancer cells. Surgery: Large tumors that can’t be treated by other methods require surgery. Surgery for retinoblastoma includesEnucleation: This surgery involves the removal of the affected eyeball. A part of the optic nerve, which is the nerve extending from the back of the eye and into the brain, is also removed.Surgery to place an eye implant: Immediately after enucleation surgery, the surgeon places a special implant made of plastic or other materials in the eye socket. The eye implant is connected to the muscles around the eye that control eye movement. The implant does not provide vision but moves like a natural eye. Fitting an artificial eye: A few weeks after surgery and as the eye heals, a custom-made artificial eye is placed over the eye implant, which matches the healthy eye. The artificial eye is clipped onto the eye implant. The artificial eye moves like the natural eye. Vision is not restored but most children adapt to having vision in only one eye without any significant discomfort. Enucleation: This surgery involves the removal of the affected eyeball.

What is the function of the fallopian tubes?,"'The fallopian tubes (also known as uterine tubes) are a total of two in number, each located on either side of the uterus. Each fallopian tube is connected to the uterus by ligaments and its other end contains finger-like projections known as fimbriae, located near the ovary.''The functions of fallopian tubes include:' Allowing the sperm to reach towards the ovum for fertilization Helping in the transport of the fertilized egg towards the uterus"
Why is a salpingectomy done?,'Your doctor will recommend salpingectomy' If you have an ectopic pregnancy (a medical emergency in which the embryo gets implanted in the fallopian tube and not in the uterus) If you have a blocked fallopian tube If you have developed an infection of the fallopian tube  If you have cancer of the fallopian tube If you want to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer If you desire permanent contraception
What is done before the salpingectomy?,"'The doctor will evaluate your fertility factors and discuss with you the benefits and risks of the surgery.''To check the functional status of the tube, a minor test known as hysterosalpingography (HSG) will be performed. In this test, a dye will be pushed into your cervix and its x-ray will be taken to see if it reaches the fallopian tube. A blocked or damaged fallopian tube would not be able to take up the dye.''You will be asked to discontinue any blood-thinning medications, such as ''Aspirin'' and ''Heparin'', a few days before the surgery.''You will be admitted to the hospital a night before the surgery.''You would not be allowed to eat or drink anything after midnight except for a few sips of water before the surgery.' "
How is the salpingectomy performed?,"'A salpingectomy can be performed as either an open (laparotomy) or laparoscopic procedure.''Currently, laparoscopic salpingectomy is generally preferred over open salpingectomy due to' Open salpingectomy: In this surgery, the surgeon makes a large cut (incision) of about 6-12 inches on your lower abdomen. The surgeon looks for the fallopian tube and separates it from the ovary and uterus and takes it out. The surgical wound is then stitched and covered with a bandage. Laparoscopic salpingectomy: This is a minimally invasive surgery in which the surgeon makes several small incisions over the lower abdomen. A long tube-like camera (laparoscope) is inserted through one of the holes or incisions to visualize the fallopian tube and its surrounding structures. Hence, this surgery is also known as keyhole surgery. Surgical instruments are then inserted through the other holes to cut and remove the fallopian tube and take it out of the body. The wound is stitched and bandaged. Lower risk of complications Reduced hospital stays Faster recovery"
How long does it take to recover from a salpingectomy?,"'You will be observed for several hours after the surgery.''Your hospital stay will be for 1-2 days in case of laparoscopic surgery and 3-7 days in case of open surgery.''You will be able to carry out your normal activities like ''walking'' and light household work immediately after getting discharged from the hospital.''Strenuous activities (such as heavy workouts, jogging, and heavy lifting) need to be restricted during the recovery period of 2-6 weeks. The duration depends upon the type of surgery; it is less in the case of laparoscopic one.''Follow-up is generally not necessary. However, you need to call the doctor right away if' You develop fever Your surgical wound becomes infected (red, warm, painful on touch, oozes fluid) You feel sudden, extreme abdominal pain You experience unexpected heavy vaginal bleeding"
What are the risks of a salpingectomy?,"'Though there are a few risks of salpingectomy, their occurrence is rare in women who undergo the surgery.''The possible complications of salpingectomy are:' Internal bleeding Bleeding from the surgical wound Infection of the surgical wound Damage to the surrounding structures or organs Hernia (protruding of an organ from an opening in the muscle, that holds it in place)"
What is scar revision?,"'Scars'' are visible remnants on the skin as they heal after an injury or accident.''Scar revision is a procedure that helps to minimize a scar and makes it less conspicuous and blends with the surrounding skin tone. It restores function and corrects disfigurement caused by an injury, a ''wound'', poor healing, or previous healing.\xa0''Scar revision may include:' Simple topical treatments Minimally invasive procedures Surgical revisions with advanced technologies"
What are the different types of scars?,'The different types of scars include:' Discoloration or surface irregularities: These types of scars do not cause any physical discomfort and can be cosmetically improved by surgery. Hypertrophic scars: These are a thick bunch of scar tissue that develop at the wound site and become uncomfortable over time. Keloids: These are larger than hypertrophic scars that are painful and itchy and may also crease. Contractures: These are scars characterized by pulling of the skin and underlying tissue during healing.
How is scar revision performed?,"'Scar revision can be performed under local anesthesia, intravenous sedation, or general anesthesia. The ''plastic surgeon'' may recommend a combination of scar revision techniques to achieve optimal results. These include:''Topical treatments: ''Gels, tapes, or external compression help in wound healing or reduce the skin’s ability to produce abnormal pigmentation. These may also help to treat existing surface scars and discoloration. It may also be useful during the healing of scar revision procedures.''Injectable treatments: ''Dermal fillers are useful in filling ''depressed'' or concave scars. The results may last anywhere from three months to several years, depending on the injectable substance. Therapy should be repeated several times to maintain results.''Surface treatments: ''These involve cosmetic improvement of the scar. It evens skin irregularities and reduces uneven pigmentation. The different types of surface treatments include:''Surgical incision:'' It is required to surgically remove an old scar.''Some scars that penetrate deep into the skin surface may require layered closure. Layered closure can be achieved with absorbable or non-removable ''sutures''. Some of the advanced techniques in scar revision include:' Dermabrasion is a mechanical polishing of the skin. Laser or light therapy brings about changes in the surfaces of the skin, leading to the formation of new, healthy skin at the scar site. Chemical peel solutions even out irregularities in texture and color by penetrating the skin’s surface. Skin bleaching agents are applied topically to lighten the skin. Complex flap closure W-plasty Z-plasty"

What is skin cancer?,"'Skin cancer'' is the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of skin cells. ''Skin cancer'' usually arises on skin exposed to the sun, such as the face, lips, ears, ''scalp'', neck, chest, arms and hands and on the legs, especially in women. Though more common in people who have lighter skin tones, ''skin cancer'' affects people with all skin tones. There are three major types of ''skin cancer''Each type of skin ''cancer'' has a different pathology and presentation.' Basal cell carcinoma  Squamous cell carcinoma Melanoma"
Does skin cancer kill you?,"'Malignant melanoma'' is a highly aggressive\xa0skin ''cancer''\xa0that tends to spread to other parts of the body. All other types of ''skin cancers'' have the potential to be locally invasive and spread to other parts of the body.\xa0Nonmelanoma skin ''cancers'' are comparatively less aggressive. Self-examination of the skin for suspicious changes, changes in existing ''moles'', persistent inflammation, ulcers, etc. can help detect skin ''cancer'' at its earliest stages. Early detection of skin cancer gives the patient the greatest chance of having successful skin cancer treatment.' "
What are the types of skin cancer?,"'The main types of skin cancers are''Basal cell carcinoma''Basal cell ''carcinoma'' usually occurs in sun-exposed areas of the body, such as the face, lips or neck. Basal cell carcinoma may present as''Squamous cell carcinoma''\xa0''Squamous cell carcinoma usually arises in sun-exposed areas of the body, such as the face, ears, hands or legs. People with darker skin tones may develop squamous cell carcinoma on areas that are not exposed to the sun. Squamous cell carcinoma presents as''Melanoma''Melanoma can develop anywhere on the body. It may arise from an existing mole that becomes cancerous or from normal skin cells. Melanoma tends to occur on the face or the trunk in men. In women, it tends to occur on the legs. Melanoma can occur on areas not exposed to the sun. Melanoma can affect people of all skin tones but it is more common in people who have lighter skin tones. Melanoma presents as''Rare types of skin cancers''Other rare types of skin cancer that may occur are' A pearly or waxy bump A flat, flesh or brownish scar-like lesion An ulcer that bleeds and has crusting An ulcer heals and recurs quickly A firm, red nodule A flat lesion that may be scaly or crusty A large brownish spot with darker speckles A mole that changes in color, size or feel or bleeds A large brownish patch or spot A small lesion with an irregular border with areas that appear red, pink, white, blue or blue-black Pain, itching or burning of the lesions  Kaposi sarcoma: This is caused by the herpes simplex virus 8 (HSV-8) and is usually seen in  people who have diseases associated with a weak immune system like AIDS. It arises from the blood vessels in the skin. The lesions appear as red or reddish-brown or purple patches on the skin or mucous membranes. Merkel cell carcinoma: This presents with firm, shiny nodules that occur on or just beneath the skin and hair follicles. The lesions commonly occur on the head, neck and trunk. Sebaceous gland carcinoma: This is a rare and aggressive cancer that originates in the sebaceous glands (oil glands) in the skin. It presents as hard, painless nodules that can occur anywhere, but commonly appear on the eyelids and may be misdiagnosed as other eyelid problems."
What causes skin cancer?,'Various factors that may increase the risk of skin cancer include' Lighter skin tones History of sunburns in the past Excessive sun exposure Several moles Precancerous skin lesions Family history History of skin cancer Weak immune system Exposure to radiation Exposure to toxins
How is skin cancer treated?,"'The treatment depends on the type and extent of skin cancer. Treatment options include' Cryosurgery: Destroying small precancerous lesions and early-stage cancer by freezing with a liquid nitrogen gun. Excisional surgery: Surgical excision (cutting out) of the cancerous tissue along with a surrounding margin of healthy skin. Mohs surgery: This procedure is performed for large, invasive and recurring skin cancer. The lesion is surgically removed layer by layer, and each layer is analyzed under the microscope until no abnormal cells are found. This procedure prevents excessive removal of surrounding healthy skin. Curettage: After the majority of the cancerous growth is removed, the remaining layers of cancer cells are scraped away using a sharp device called a curet. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy uses external radiation beams to destroy cancer cells.  Chemotherapy: Anticancer drugs are used to kill cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy: This treatment destroys skin cancer cells using a combination of laser light and medication that makes cancer cells sensitive to light and hence destroys them. Biological therapy: Biological therapy modulates the immune system to kill cancer cells."
What causes strabismus?,"'There are six muscles in the eye that work in coordination with each other to bring eye movements. The problem in the functioning of these muscles or in the nerves that control these muscles is thought to be the cause of ''strabismus''.''Strabismus'' is found to be caused by the following conditions:' Heredity (family history of strabismus) Uncorrected shortsightedness Uncorrected farsightedness Poor vision in one eye Cerebral palsy (a group of disorders occurring by birth that affects muscle tone or posture) Down syndrome Hydrocephalus (a condition present by birth that results in a buildup of fluid in the brain) Stroke (the most common cause of strabismus in adults) Head injuries (damage to the area that is concerned with the control of eye movements) Graves disease (a thyroid disorder in which there is increased production of thyroid hormone Disorders of the nervous system, such as myasthenia gravis Brain tumors Any eye surgery that can damage the eye muscles"
How is strabismus treated?,"'After taking the medical history of the patient, the doctor discusses various treatment options with you that include:' Eyeglasses: These are used in patients with uncorrected refractive errors, shortsightedness, and farsightedness. These are special glasses to help focus and straighten the eyes. Prism lens: This is a type of specialized lens that bends the light rays and allows the affected person to focus. They can be attached to eyeglasses or made as part of the lens. Eye exercises: These are recommended for patients who have their eyes directed outwards (exotropia). Eye exercises help focus both eyes inward. Medications: Medications include Atropine that can be given in the form of eye drops or ointments. The problem of the eye muscles is treated with injections of Botulinum toxin type A, such as Botox. Patching: Patching aims at strengthening a misaligned eye that is weaker than the other. An eye patch is applied over the stronger eye, which forces the person to use the weaker eye resulting in the restoration of the weaker eye’s strength. Eye muscle surgery: A surgery that changes the length or position of eye muscles helps in achieving the proper alignment of eyes."
What happens if strabismus is not treated?,"'Without treatment, strabismus can worsen over time. This is especially true for children.''Untreated strabismus may result in:' Lazy eye (amblyopia): Because each eye points in different directions, two images of the same object are produced. Over time, the stronger (healthy) eye amongst the two works more to produce a single image, which results in poor vision in the other (strabismus-affected) eye. Around one-third of children with strabismus end up with amblyopia. Blurring of vision Permanent double vision Eyestrain Frequent headaches Low self-esteem"
Why is conization done?,"'Conization may be performed for diagnostic and/or treatment purposes.''Diagnostic conization''Therapeutic conization' Finding the presence of abnormal cells (potentially cancerous), such as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), when lesions are not visible to the naked eye or during other diagnostic tests like colposcopy. Unsatisfactory colposcopy due to inability to view the entire cervix by the doctor To diagnose the presence or absence of spread cervical tumors To detect the presence of cancer or potentially cancerous areas To confirm a diagnosis if the biopsy (testing of a small piece of sample tissue) results are inconsistent Therapeutic conization is the treatment of choice to treat grades 2 and 3 of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cancers that have not yet spread). All the available techniques and approaches of conization are effective. In addition to conization, carcinoma in situ (CIN) can also be treated by performing a hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus and cervix) or by other destructive procedures. The decision to combine conization with other procedures depends on the extent of the disease, the general condition of the patient’s condition, the patient’s age, and the desire for child rearing."
What happens during conization?,"'Conization is usually performed under general anesthesia. A small cone-shaped tissue is removed by the surgeon from the cervix for diagnosis, or the surgeon may use the procedure to remove diseased tissue. The cervical tissue may be removed using a wire loop heated by electrical current, also called ''LEEP'' (''loop electrosurgical excision procedure''), ''cryotherapy'' (freezing), a scalpel (also called cold knife biopsy), or a laser. Cryotherapy, cold knife, or LEEP is preferable when no treatment is being done. Laser conization can be excisional or destructive by vaporization, and hence, it can be used for treatment as well. The cervical canal above the region of cone biopsy may also be scraped to remove cells for evaluation. This is called endocervical curettage (ECC).''After the procedure:''Patients experience ''pain'' and discomfort for which painkillers would be administered. Antibiotics may be given to prevent infection. Patients are usually discharged the same day or the next day. Patients usually have ''vaginal bleeding'' for a few days after the procedure; they would have to use sanitary napkins (tampons can increase the risk of infection). Most patients can resume their daily activities the next day. Specific activities like sexual intercourse, sports, and ''exercise'' may be resumed after consulting with the surgeon.' "
Is conization safe?,"'Conization is generally a safe procedure but is usually avoided during ''pregnancy'' because it is associated with significant risks during pregnancy, such as postpartum hemorrhage (severe blood loss) and fetal loss. Rarely conization may be performed during pregnancy in invasive ''cancer'' if it’s during the first or ''second trimester''.''Some possible risks that may be associated with the conization procedure include:' Bleeding Infection Cervical incompetence (which may lead to miscarriages or preterm delivery) Scarring of the cervix, which can cause painful periods, preterm delivery, and infertility Damage to the bladder or rectum Reaction to anesthesia"
Can I quit smoking without gaining weight?,"'An individual may take a few precautions to counter weight gain after they ''quit smoking'':' Avoid alcohol Tea would be a good substitute than coffee after smoking cessation Include high-fiber foods in your diet. Eat regular meals and eat at least 250 fewer calories a day than you ate before you quit. Exercise for a half-hour every day. Include weight-bearing exercise in routine at least twice a week. Drink lots of water Talk to your doctor about Bupropion, a drug that may help with smoking withdrawal and weight gain"
What type of diet is usually recommended after smoking cessation?,"'Nutritionists may usually recommend a healthy diet after smoking cessation:' Protein: They keep appetite in check and is good for the brain Minerals, such as nuts and seeds, are usually recommended Healthy fats like avocado may give a person the required energy Complex carbohydrates also help in controlling the hunger Drinking water at regular interval may help the body in eliminating toxins Plenty of fruits and vegetables Wholegrain options for cereals, bread, pasta, and rice Lean cuts of meat, poultry, and fish"

How many people get bitten by dogs?," Almost 70 million dogs live in the United States, and since many victims of dog bites don't seek medical care or report the attack, it may be that the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s estimate of 4.5 million dog bites each year in the U.S. may be too low. Over one million of dog bite victims go to emergency medical care at hospitals in the U.S. every year. Dogs have rounded teeth, and it is the pressure exerted by their jaws that can cause significant damage to the tissues under the skin, including bones, muscles, tendons, blood vessels, and nerves. The risk of being bitten by a dog increases if there is a dog in the home; the more dogs there are, the greater the risk. Men are more frequent bitten by dogs than women, who are bitten by cats more often. Children between the ages of 5 and 9 are more likely to be bitten by a dog than other age groups. Children are also more likely to need medical attention."
What should you do if a dog bites you?,"   If a dog bites you or someone that you are with, you need go to a safe place away from the dog that has bitten you to prevent further attack and injury. Infants and children should be evaluated after any dog bite. If there are no signs of skin damage or if there is a small amount of abrasion from a dog bite, it may be reasonable to watch for signs and symptoms of infection (pain, redness, warmth, swelling, and drainage of pus or fluid) before seeking medical care. Wounds should be kept elevated and if it is possible, you may attempt to clean the dog bite with tap water. Gather information from the dog's owner about the dog's rabies immunization status, but if this is not possible, hospital, animal control centers, or law enforcement personnel will help gather any required information. Since dog bites can cause significant damage beneath the skin, a type of injury that cannot always easily be seen. Moreover, if there is pain at or near the dog bite, underlying tissues and other structures may have been damaged or if the bite disrupts the skin causing a puncture, laceration, or tear, call your doctor or go to the nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department."
What is the treatment and management for infections and other problems from a dog bite?,"'Three important treatment issues that need to be addressed with a dog bite:'""It is easy to look at a dog bite and see that the skin has been damaged, but it is also important to assess the underlying structures that may have also been injured in the attack. The patient often concentrates on the cosmetic appearance of the wound; while that is important, the health care practitioner may be more concerned about the injuries that will impair the body's function. For example, a laceration to a hand may look bad, but more important than the potential scarring would be a lacerated tendon that would prevent a finger from moving.""'The potential for infection from a dog bite is extremely high. Dog bites inoculate bacteria deep into tissue, and while not as aggressive as cat bites, the majority of dog bites get infected. Common bacteria involved in such infections include ''Streptococcus'', ''Staphylococcus'', and ''Pasteurella''.''Find out if the dog that bit you has current rabies immunizations. If the dog has not been immunized for rabies, the question becomes whether to immunize the patient against the rabies virus. A variety of approaches may be considered depending upon the situation surrounding the bite.'""Once the doctor or other healthcare professional has taken a history of the events and examined the patient, most dog bites can be cared for in the emergency department, urgent care centers, or a doctor's office. The physical exam will help decide whether any deep structures like muscle, tendon, nerve, or bone have been damaged.""'Commonly, the wound is anesthetized so that it can be explored. This will help confirm the condition of the deep structures and their function. The wound will then be washed with normal saline (a salt-water solution) to irrigate out as much dirt and bacteria as possible.''Once the wound has been cleaned, a decision needs to be made whether to close the skin. Stitching the skin (to make the scar look better) increases the risk of infection. Balancing the risk of infection against the benefit of a better-looking scar depends upon the location of the injury and the discussion between the doctor and patient. Dog bites to the face tend to be sutured, while those located on less noticeable parts of the body may be left to heal on their own.''Sometimes, dog bite wounds need surgery to repair the wound if there is considerable skin damage or skin loss, or if there are associated injuries that need treatment.''Some dog bites In infants and children may need surgery to repair lacerations, especially if facial wounds are involved, because of the need for prolonged anesthetic to keep the patient still.''There is some controversy regarding antibiotic therapy for dog bites. Some doctors routinely prescribe antibiotics while others choose to wait until the wound shows signs and symptoms of potential infection.'   Skin damage Injury to underlying tissues such as muscle, nerve, and bone Infection Is the dog available to be observed? Was the bite provoked or defensive rather than an unprovoked attack? Where is the bite located? What is the past medical history of the victim?"
Will I get rabies?,"""If the dog bite victim does not to seek medical care, the rabies immunization status of the dog must be determined immediately. Rabies therapy, if necessary, must begin as soon as possible. The victim's ""'tetanus'' status also needs to be current.''Exposure to a rabid animal does not always result in rabies. If treatment is initiated promptly following a rabies exposure, rabies can be prevented. If a rabies exposure is not treated and a person develops clinical signs of rabies, the diseased usually results in death.' "
8 tips to prevent dog bites,"'Dog bites often occur when there is miscommunication between the dog and the victim. It is not common to have an unprovoked attack by a stray dog. Often, it is the dog owner or a family member who is bitten. To prevent being bitten by a dog:'  Choose a dog breed that is compatible with the family. Aggressive dogs may not be appropriate in a home with infants and small children. Dogs are social animals; therefore, socializing and appropriate training will help minimize the risk of dog bites. Do not approach a stray or unfamiliar dog, especially if the owner is not present. Do not approach a dog with quick motions or from above their head. Allow time for the dog to acknowledge your presence before attempting to pet it. Prior to contact with the dog, ask the owner if is OK to pet the dog. If a confrontation occurs, do not make eye contact and do not run or scream. Do not approach an unfamiliar dog while it is eating, sleeping, or caring for puppies. Do not leave young children or infants unsupervised with a dog."
What is domestic violence? What are the types of domestic violence?,"'Domestic violence (DV) -- also called dating violence, intimate partner abuse, spousal abuse, intimate partner violence (IPV), and domestic abuse -- takes many forms. Maltreatment that takes place in the context of any romantic relationship is abuse as described by the above specific terms. It therefore affects men, women, or ''teen girls'' and boys, whether in a married or unmarried heterosexual or homosexual relationship. Intimate partner violence may consist of one or more forms, including emotional, psychological, physical, sexual, or economic abuse and is defined as one person in an intimate relationship using any means to put down or otherwise control the other. Types of domestic abuse include physical, verbal (also called emotional, mental, or psychological abuse), sexual, economic/financial, and spiritual abuse. Stalking and cyber-stalking are also forms of intimate partner abuse.'""Physically abusive behaviors include assault of any kind, ranging from pinching, pushing, hitting, or slapping to choking, shooting, stabbing, and murder. Verbal, emotional, mental, or psychological violence is described as using words to criticize, demean, or otherwise decrease the confidence of the wife, husband, or other intimate partner victim. Sexual abuse refers to any behavior that uses sex to control or demean the victim, like intimidating the victim into engaging in unsafe sex or sexual practices in which he or she does not want to participate. Economic or financial abuse is described as threatening or otherwise limiting the victim's financial freedom or security. Spiritual abusers either force the victim to participate in the batterer's religious practices instead of their own or to raise mutual children in a religion that the victim is not in favor of. Stalking refers to repeatedly harassing and threatening behavior, including showing up at the victim's home or workplace, placing harassing phone calls, voicemail, email or postal mail messages, leaving unwanted items, or vandalizing the victim's property. It is usually committed by perpetrators of other forms of domestic violence.""""Domestic violence is a major public health problem in that it affects millions of people and often results in physical and emotional injuries and even deaths. Media reporting of celebrities' domestic abuse victimization demonstrates that even the most accomplished individuals can be involved in this problem. The statistics about those who are affected by intimate partner violence are staggering; domestic abuse affects 3%-5% of current adult relationships in the United States, including more than 2 million women. Despite this issue disproportionately affecting women, the myth that violence against men does not occur is incorrect; 800,000 men are victims of intimate partner abuse. Nearly one-third of women can expect to be the victim of intimate partner violence sometime in their lifetime. About 25% of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals are victims of intimate partner abuse, just as often as are heterosexual women. About 1,300 deaths were attributed to domestic abuse as of 2003. Research into deaths that result from intimate partner abuse in the United States and Austria indicate that more than 50% of women murdered are the result of domestic violence, most often using a gun. About 4%-9% of men are killed as victims of domestic violence. Approximately 65% of the approximate 1,300 murder-suicides that occur in the United States every year involve intimate partners""'Teen intimate partner abuse takes place at an alarming rate. Facts about domestic violence in this group include that as many as 12% of adolescents in grades 7 through 12 have been victims of physical dating violence, and 20% of youth have suffered from psychological dating violence. This abuse puts victims in danger of practicing risky sexual behavior, unhealthy eating, ''drug use'', and ''suicidal'' behaviors. Other complications can include physical injury and death. These victims are also more likely to become sufferers of intimate partner violence as adults.''LGBT people often face unique challenges when trying to cope with domestic-abuse victimization. The assumption by family, friends, coworkers, and professionals that abuse is mutual in homosexual couples or is an expected part of what is perceived as a dysfunctional relationship since it is not heterosexual, poses major obstacles to battered LGBT individuals in getting help. Other barriers for LGBT battered men and women include the fear of losing their jobs, home, and/or custody of their children should their sexual orientation become known in the context of getting help for intimate partner abuse. That LGBT individuals do not receive the legal and financial protections their heterosexual counterparts do can inhibit their ability to support themselves and live independently after leaving the abuser. Discrimination against LGBT people and other minorities is also a deterrent to receiving care. Another formidable obstacle includes a lack of knowing other admitted LGBT victims of domestic violence, as well as the smallness of the community, which can make it difficult for battered men and women in the LGBT community to live anonymously from their abuser in the same town.''There tends to be a cycle of behavior, known as the cycle of violence, in abusive relationships. That cycle includes the tension-building, explosive, and tranquility/honeymoon stages. The tension-building stage is described as the phase of the abusive relationship in which the abuser tends to engage in lower-level abuse, like pushing, insulting, coercive behaviors, and escalating demands for control. Simultaneously, the victim of abuse tends to try to appease the abuser in an effort to avoid worsening of the abuse. Acts of abuse escalate to a severe level during the explosive stage of intimate partner violence, manifesting as the most overt and serious acts of abuse and control, like slapping, punching, inhibiting the movements of the victim, ''rape'', or other sexual violence. The tranquility or honeymoon stage of the cycle of domestic violence tends to immediately follow the overt acts of aggression of the explosive stage and is usually characterized by the abuser seeming to be quite remorseful and apologetic for the abuse, making promises that it will never happen again and showering the victim with affection.' "
What is the history of domestic violence?,"'Domestic violence or violence that is expressed using intimate acts is unfortunately as timeless as history. Rape and other forms of sexual assault and sexual exploitation have historically been used to demoralize groups of people as in German concentration camps, on North America-bound slave ships, and in World War II Japanese brothels filled with ""comfort women."" Society-sanctioned forms of violence against women include infibulation (fastening or buckling together, as in binding of ''feet'', or of the female genitalia in an effort to render less able to walk or render unable to have sexual intercourse, respectively) and female genital cutting or excision, also known as female ''circumcision''. Virtually all the world\'s societies view or have viewed women as less valuable than men. From assaults of women for attending school, ""honor"" killings of women for being victims or rape or other sexual violence or having premarital sex in some countries, to women being omitted from serving on juries in the United States until 1701 and prevented from voting until 1920, the view that women are somehow second-class citizens encourages mistreatment of women.' "
What are the effects of domestic abuse?,"'Domestic abuse has significant health and public health consequences. Between 25%-50% of homeless families have lost their homes as a result of intimate partner violence. Such victimization is also associated with nearly $6 billion in health care costs and lost work productivity per year. Domestic violence sufferers are at higher risk of facing discrimination in securing any form of insurance, including health, life, disability, and property insurances. Victims of domestic violence are more likely to experience trouble raising their children and suffer family disruption, as well. Although psychological abuse can be harder to define than overt physical abuse, it has been found to cause at least as much damage. Victims of intimate partner violence are vulnerable to developing ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and substance abuse disorders.''Partner abuse of ''pregnant'' women has been associated with preterm deliveries of low-birth-weight ''babies''. Domestic partner abuse puts children of the couple at risk for lower intellectual functioning, being victims of ''child abuse'' as children, and of intimate partner violence as adults. This form of family violence also puts children at higher risk of having emotional problems and engaging in ''drug abuse''. Given such risks, the presence of intimate partner abuse in a family should be an important consideration in child custody issues. Domestic violence results in homicide, as well. Victims who live in a household where weapons are present and ''drugs'' are used have a greater risk of being killed by their abuser.' "
What are the causes or risk factors for intimate partner violence (IPV)?,"'Although there is no specific cause for domestic violence, women at the highest risk for being the victim of domestic violence include those with male partners who abuse drugs (especially alcohol), are unemployed or underemployed, afflicted by poverty, have not graduated from high school, and are or have been in a romantic relationship with the victim. Unmarried individuals in heterosexual relationships tend to be more at risk for becoming victims of intimate partner abuse. A mind-set that gives men power over women puts individuals at risk for becoming involved in an abusive relationship, either as a perpetrator or as a victim. Domestic violence against women tends to be reported more often by victims who are in a relationship with a man with more conservative religious views than their own, regardless of whether or not the couple is of the same or different religions or denominations. Regular attendance at religious services is apparently associated with less reported intimate partner abuse. Research shows that those who grew up in a household in which domestic violence took place or in which a parent suffered from ''alcoholism'' are more likely to become either perpetrators or victims of intimate partner violence as adults. Teenagers who suffer from ''mental illness'' are also at risk for being an abusive relationship as young adults. African-American and Hispanic ''teens'' have been found to be at higher risk for being victims of teen domestic violence, with some studies indicating independence of socioeconomic status. Another risk factor for teen dating/domestic violence includes lower grades.' "
What are the warning signs and symptoms of intimate partner abuse?,"'PsychCentral provides a list of several screening questions for people who wonder if they are the victim of any form of domestic abuse. In addition to asking questions about whether the reader feels excessively controlled (such as having their partner keep excessive track of daily activities and associations, or being demeaned by critical remarks, insults, and name calling), the list of questions further explores whether more obvious acts of abuse have occurred, like hitting, kicking, punching, or throwing objects. The acronym AARDVARC (An Abuse, Rape, Domestic Violence Aid and Resource Collection) describes a number of warning signs for friends, family members, and coworkers for recognizing people who may be victims of intimate partner abuse. Specifically, teens, men, or women who are often absent from school or work or have numerous injuries they try to explain away, like ''bruises'' or black eyes. Individuals with low self-esteem, who show a change in their personality, have a fear of conflicts, engage in passive-aggressive behavior, blame themselves, seem isolated, or demonstrate ''stress''-related physical symptoms (for example, ''headaches'', stomach upset, ''sleep problems'', or skin ''rashes'') may be experiencing abuse in their relationship.'  "
How do medical professionals assess domestic violence?,"'Unfortunately, although assessing whether a man or woman is being abused in their relationship is quite manageable, less than one in 20 doctors do so routinely. That tendency compounds the difficulty posed by the victims of intimate partner violence tending not to disclose their victimization. Despite these difficulties, it is known that questions that are most effective in assessing domestic violence are open-ended as opposed to those asking for yes or no answers (for example, ""How do you and your partner tend to disagree with each other?"" versus ""Does your spouse hit, demean, or over-control you?""). Indirect questions about things like how many emergency-room visits, injuries, or accidents they have had this year are more likely to be answered candidly than are direct questions about the cause of each injury. As with any sensitive or potentially painful topic, questions about domestic violence are answered truthfully more often when the person asked is alone with the professional, as opposed to being asked with their partner (the potential batterer), child, or other family member present during the discussion.' "
What are treatment options for intimate partner violence?,"'Getting and keeping the victim of domestic violence safe is an essential part of treating domestic abuse. Many legal and ''mental health'"" professionals who work with victims recommend the development of safety plans, both for home and in the workplace. Such a plan includes encouraging the victim to keep a charged cell phone in his or her possession at all times, maintaining active peace, protective, or restraining orders against the batterer, keeping a copy of the order at all times, along with distributing copies of the order to the victim's supervisor, workplace reception area, and security, as well as to schools and day care providers for children. It is important for battered men and women to realize that abusers sometimes escalate in their abusiveness when first served with a protective order and to take appropriately heightened safety precautions. Other elements of a safety plan may include the victim changing his or her work site, parking, or work schedule, having an emergency contact person, and establishing danger signals to alert neighbors or coworkers that the victim is in immediate danger.""""One well-known approach to treating domestic abuse families is the Duluth Model. It is also called the Domestic Abuse Intervention Project (DAIP) and focuses on women as the victims and men as the perpetrators of intimate partner violence. This treatment model takes the approach of empowering women by providing them information, resources, and support, which significantly decreases the violence in victims' lives over time. It also uses legal resources as a means of keeping women safe and holding males who engage in battering accountable for their actions. Regarding specific treatment for batterers, compliance with multiple counseling sessions may decrease the likelihood that domestic violence perpetrators repeat the behavior, but the Duluth Model has not demonstrated a clear decrease in perpetrator behaviors. There are other treatment approaches to batterers that have had positive results but none that have been sufficiently studied to recommend on a large scale. Support groups for victims of intimate partner violence have been found to decrease how often participants justify their victimization and are revictimized. They also tend to decrease participant ""'depression'' and other mental health symptoms, as well as improve self-esteem and social support, both during participation in the group and months after the intervention ends.''Having professionals provide victims of domestic violence with information about domestic-violence shelters and other housing, financial, and other service supports in the community has been found to greatly decrease the amount of violence that victims of intimate partner abuse experience after leaving the abuser. For couples with whom alcoholism or other excessive alcohol use is an issue, diagnosis of that illness and marital therapy that has alcoholism as a focus has also been found to be effective.' "
How is intimate partner abuse legally addressed?,"""Laws against domestic abuse are essential in the effort to protect battered men and women from their abusers. Federal law, like the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) that was passed in 1994 and renewed in 2000 and in 2013, as well as federal anti-stalking and anti-cyber-stalking legislation, provide significant prison terms and fines of up to more than $200,000 for domestic violence charges resulting in convictions in an effort to discourage abusive behaviors. The Federal Gun Control Act and federal firearm offenses now include provisions for domestic violence-related crimes. Limitations of this protection include the enforcement of legal protections for all victims, as well as the omission of legal protection for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) victims of intimate partner violence. Although all 50 states and the District of Columbia have laws against stalking, less than one-third have laws that address cyber-stalking. Also, stalking can be difficult to define, since it can take the form of virtually any pattern of harassing behaviors. Furthermore, most stalking laws require that a credible threat of harm be made toward the victim or the victim's immediate family.""'Some form of mandatory reporting, now the legal requirement in 47 states, requires that health professionals report suspected instances of domestic violence to the police; it is a somewhat controversial legal intervention for domestic violence. While mandatory reporting may result in some partner violence victims and perpetrators receiving the treatment they need, it is thought by some to place the victim at risk for experiencing a worsening of the abuse as a result of the abuser being angered because of the report. Another criticism of mandatory reporting includes the violation of doctor-patient confidentiality that is important for effective treatment to occur.' "
What is the prognosis for domestic violence?,"'Since the prognosis for victims of intimate partner violence is better for individuals who have a strong support system, support group participation is often encouraged. Enhancing the supports received by the family marred by domestic violence can even decrease the symptoms of ''post-traumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD'') that is often associated with intimate partner abuse.''LGBT people who are abused in an intimate relationship face multiple obstacles to getting help. Misperceptions that LGBT victims of domestic violence participate in mutually abusing each other and that abuse is part of what some perceive to be an inherently dysfunctional relationship can result in health care and law-enforcement professionals failing to appropriately respond to LGBT abuse sufferers. The inexperience that professionals have in managing intimate partner violence in LGBT relationships can also interfere with victims and batterers receiving appropriate and timely interventions.' "
How can intimate partner abuse be prevented and stopped?,"'Since having a strong support system has been found to be a protective factor against domestic violence, encouraging such support has been found to decrease the likelihood that a person will become the perpetrator or victim of domestic violence. An example of that is the tendency for people who are involved with a supportive religious community to have a decreased risk for being in a relationship in which intimate partner abuse occurs. This is apparently also the case for people of Hispanic or African-American ethnicity. Effective solutions for preventing intimate partner abuse include providing economic opportunity, mentors, safety advocates, role models who are survivors of domestic violence, organized community programs for youth and families and a school environment that promotes prevention of abusiveness in any relationship. Adult family members can help prevent domestic violence by being nurturing and by providing consistent, structured supervision. Raising the awareness about intimate partner violence in society at large, as occurs during Domestic Violence Awareness Month each October, can be invaluable to educating people about this issue.'""According to the House of Ruth, a domestic violence center, everyone can help find ways to stop domestic violence, either by donating money or time to a domestic-violence organization, learning more about the problem, teaching children about healthy versus abusive relationships, listening in a nonjudgmental way to a domestic violence victim when he or she shares what they are going through, and giving victims information about where to get help. Supporters of intimate partner abuse victims can also discourage sexist jokes and remarks, boycott movies that gratuitously depict intimate partner violence and violence against women, and write legislators to support laws that protect and otherwise support intimate violence sufferers. Advocacy can further involve encouraging one's own health care providers to post and share information about the issue. In the workplace, those who want to help stop to domestic abuse can organize a drive or fundraiser for goods or money to give to a domestic-violence organization.""  "

"
Introduction to endoscopy,"'The use of upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopes has revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ''esophagus'', stomach, duodenum, and colon (''large intestine''). The last remaining frontier in the ''intestines'' has been the small intestine. Wireless ''capsule endoscopy'' allows physicians to visualize the inside of the intestines from the esophagus through to the colon, but capsule ''endoscopy'"" has limitations, the most notable of which are the inability to control the capsule's passage and to perform therapeutic interventions, such as biopsy and electrocautery. Although capsule endoscopy is likely to remain an important diagnostic procedure because of its simplicity, the limitations of capsule endoscopy have been overcome by the development of balloon endoscopy, also known as enteroscopy.""  "
What is balloon endoscopy?,'There are two types of balloon endoscopy: single balloon and double balloon. ' 
Single balloon endoscopy,"'For single balloon endoscopy, a 200 cm long flexible, fiberoptic, endoscope (a hose-like tube one centimeter in diameter with a light and a camera on the tip) is fitted with an equally long overtube that slides the full length of the endoscope. On the tip of the overtube is a balloon that can be inflated and deflated. The balloon is blown up to anchor the overtube within the intestine. While the overtube is anchored, the endoscope can be advanced further into the small intestine. By withdrawing the overtube the small intestine can be shortened and straightened to make the passage of the inner endoscope easier. The balloon may then be deflated so that the overtube can be inserted further and the endoscope advanced again. The endoscope itself is a standard endoscope with working channels that allow the intestine to be inflated with air, rinsed with water, or used to guide biopsy or electrocautery instruments to the tip of the endoscope.' "
Double balloon endoscopy,"'For double balloon endoscopy, similar equipment is used, but a second balloon is located on the tip of the endoscope. Both balloons - the one on the overtube and the one on the endoscope - can be alternatively inflated to anchor the overtube or the endoscope to assist with the passage of the endoscope or overtube, respectively.' "
What to expect with balloon endoscopy,"'Balloon endoscopy, like other gastrointestinal endoscopy, requires intravenous sedation. The procedures are long, often requiring 1-3 hours. The most important complications of balloon endoscopy are perforation of the small intestine or bleeding either due to insertion of the endoscope or the use of therapeutic instruments.'  "
What is the future for balloon endoscopy?,"'Balloon endoscopy is revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of small intestinal diseases. Nevertheless, its use is restricted because of the large expenditure of time that is necessary to perform it. Either newer, faster systems will need to be designed or, perhaps, paramedical personnel will be needed to perform the insertions before balloon endoscopy is as commonly performed as other types of endoscopy. For now, when there is concern about disease in the small intestine, wireless capsule endoscopy often is performed first. Then, if abnormalities are found, or if despite a normal capsule endoscopy there still is a strong suspicion that there may be disease in the small intestine, balloon endoscopy is performed.' "
What is double vision?,"'Double vision'' is the perception of two images of a single object seen adjacent to each other (horizontally, vertically, or obliquely) or overlapping. ''Diplopia'' is the medical term for ''double vision''. Polyplopia is the perception of three or more images of a single object overlapping each other.''Double vision is called ""monocular"" when the double image is perceived by an eye that is tested alone. In ""binocular"" double vision, each eye sees a single image when tested alone, but a double image is present when both eyes are open.' "
What causes double vision?,"'There are dozens of causes of double vision, ranging from benign to life-threatening. Therefore, it is important for the doctor to carefully review the history and perform an examination to determine the cause and initiate appropriate treatment when necessary. Sometimes, emergency treatment is needed.''Most causes of monocular diplopia stem from poor focusing of light by the eye. Refractive errors (''myopia'', ''hyperopia'', ''astigmatism'') are causes. ''Dry eye'"" (from a variety of causes such as meibomitis, Sjögren's syndrome, and decreased tear production following refractive surgery) can produce diplopia that varies with blinking. ""'Cataracts'' (clouding of the natural ''lens'') and posterior capsule opacification (which can occur after ''cataract surgery'') are common in people over 60 years of age and can produce diplopia along with other vision problems. Other conditions that interfere with proper focusing of light include corneal irregularity from ''keratoconus'', swelling or ''scars'', and retinal conditions such as epiretinal membranes. Rarely is the underlying cause a medical emergency in cases of monocular diplopia.''Binocular diplopia on the other hand is produced by a misalignment of the two eyes, which in some instances can be caused by life-threatening conditions. For example, aneurysms, ''strokes'', ''trauma'' (''head injury''), and increased intracranial pressure (for example, from a growth or mass such as a ''brain tumor'') can cause eye misalignment by affecting the nerves that control eye movement and alignment. . These nerves control the extraocular muscles that move the eyes in different direction of gaze. If these nerves lose blood supply or are compressed, the muscles they control become weak or paralyzed. This is called a cranial nerve palsy.''Other diseases affecting the nervous system can lead to binocular double vision. In ''multiple sclerosis'', nervous system inflammatory lesions that affect various parts of the visual system may result in double vision that varies over time. Guillain-Barré syndrome can also produce double vision from nerve damage. ''Migraine'' ''headaches'' can cause a sudden but temporary ''strabismus'' (eye misalignment). In ''myasthenia gravis'', the communication between the nerves and the eye muscles is abnormal, resulting in diplopia that varies by the time of day, typically worsening with ''fatigue''.''Binocular double vision can also occur with damage to the eye muscles themselves. '""Graves' disease""' (often associated with ''thyroid disease''), orbital inflammations, ''vascular disease'' (as seen with ''diabetes'' and ''high blood pressure''), and others are examples of diseases that directly affect the extraocular muscles through compression, poor blood supply, or local eye inflammation. Eye movement and alignment can also be abnormal if muscles and orbital tissue become trapped in a skull bone ''fracture'' from ''trauma'', leading to restriction of eye movement in certain directions of gaze.''Childhood ''strabismus'' (eye misalignment), such as ''crossed eyes'' (esotropia) or out-turned eyes (exotropia), occasionally produces double vision, and often children develop ways to suppress the double vision. However, this suppression may result in ''amblyopia'"" (a weakening of the eye's visual development). For this reason, children whose eyes appear misaligned should be evaluated by an eye doctor for treatment that may range from glasses, vision therapy, and patching to surgery.""'Sometimes the cause of binocular double vision is relatively harmless, such as when ''fatigue'' or illness results in a temporary misalignment of the eyes. This is called a phoria, which is a variable, intermittent type of ''strabismus'' (eye misalignment). Another ''fatigue''-related misalignment is convergence insufficiency, which is the inability to keep the eyes converged (slightly crossed) for long periods while reading. This can often be alleviated with eye exercises (""pencil pushups"" vision therapy) or prism glasses.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of double vision?,"'Images may appear to overlap each other or may appear adjacent to each other. This can lead to other symptoms, such as ''blurred vision'' and ''dizziness''. The double vision may be monocular (one or both eyes sees multiple images when tested individually) or binocular (double vision is seen only when both eyes are open, but each eye sees a single image when tested individually).'""Double vision can be constant or variable. For example, double vision that varies with blinking is often related to irregularities of the eye's surface. Binocular diplopia may vary depending on the direction of gaze or with tilting or turning of the head. ""'Fatigue'' may also contribute to variable double vision.'  "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose the cause of double vision?,"'A thorough evaluation of double vision begins with a detailed history, including onset (gradual or sudden), duration, frequency (intermittent or constant), and variability with ''fatigue'', head position, or direction of eye gaze, noting any associated symptoms (''pain'', ''headache'', ''nausea'', and ''weight loss'"" among others) and other vision problems. A complete history of past and current medical conditions is reviewed. The physical examination to assess eye health includes measuring the vision (visual acuity) in each eye and assessing whether the diplopia is monocular or binocular. Careful examination of the eyes' alignment in various head positions is performed if the diplopia is binocular. A complete eye examination, which may include dilating the eyes, is performed to look for any ""'ocular'' or orbital abnormalities. Particular attention is paid to the pupils and ''eyelid'' position if a neurologic cause is suspected. In some instances, specialized imaging (topography, ''CT'', ''MRI'', etc.) and other tests are needed to further investigate possible causes. When a life- or vision-threatening cause is suspected, time is of the essence.'  "
What is the treatment for double vision?,"'Once the underlying cause has been determined, treatment is tailored to the underlying condition.''For example, diplopia stemming from refractive errors (''myopia'', ''hyperopia'', ''astigmatism'') can be corrected with glasses or ''contact lenses''. ''Dry eyes'' may be treated with artificial tears, anti-inflammatory drops, punctal plugs, warm compresses, and a variety of other treatments. Many corneal irregularities are treatable with medication, laser, or surgery. ''Cataracts'' are treated with surgery, and posterior capsule opacification (after ''cataract'' surgery) is treated with laser. Binocular diplopia is occasionally caused by vision-threatening or life-threatening conditions requiring urgent or emergent treatment. This is particularly the case with aneurysms, head trauma, ''stroke'', and other neurologic conditions. Any onset of diplopia with accompanying neurologic symptoms such as ''headache'', ''nausea'', ''dizziness'', loss of balance, etc., should be evaluated immediately.''In many cases, double vision may subside with treatment of the underlying disease.''Double vision produced by poor blood supply to the nerves in ''diabetes'' will often resolve over time as the blood ''sugar'' is brought under better control. If eye muscle movements are restricted due to scarring (such as chronic '""Graves' disease""') or entrapment (as after traumatic orbital bone ''fracture''), surgery of the muscles or surrounding tissue may correct the problem.''Convergence insufficiency, or inability to align the eyes when focusing on a near object, is a common benign cause of intermittent binocular diplopia when reading. It can improve with eye exercises (pencil pushups) or with use of prisms.''Often glasses with prisms can be worn to correct binocular diplopia. If the diplopia is expected to resolve, temporary prisms (Fresnel prisms) can be added to glasses and later removed when the eyes realign.'  "
What types of doctors treat double vision?,"'Eye doctors (optometrists and ophthalmologists) can perform the assessment and treat underlying ''ocular'' diseases. The primary care doctor (family practitioner, internist, or pediatrician) is often involved when an underlying systemic is causing the double vision. In some cases, specialists such as neurologists, endocrinologists, and neurosurgeons may also be called upon to provide treatment.' "
Is it possible to prevent double vision?,"'If the underlying cause is preventable, your physician will suggest ways to minimize chance of recurrence.' "
What is the prognosis for double vision?,"'The prognosis is dependent on the underlying cause. Monocular diplopia due to ''blurred vision'' has a good prognosis as long as the underlying cause of the blur is correctable. Binocular diplopia may resolve with treatment of the underlying cause, however, in some instances, there may be permanent misalignment of the eyes due to nerve or muscle damage or scarring. If surgical realignment is insufficient or not an option, glasses with prisms might help in some cases.' "
What is vaginal douching?,"'Douching is the practice of washing or flushing the vagina with water or other fluids. Vaginal douches are available as prepackaged mixes, most commonly involving water mixed with vinegar, baking soda, or ''iodine''. Douches are available at pharmacies and supermarkets.' "
Is vaginal douching necessary? Does it prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?,"'The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that women avoid the practice of vaginal douching. Most physicians also do not recommend douching. Douching can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the vagina and can alter the normal pH of the vagina. Changes in the composition of the bacteria that normally reside within the vagina can lead to an increased risk of vaginal infections such as yeast infections. Douching can also cause the spread of harmful bacteria further up into the reproductive tract if an infection is already present in the vagina.''Women who ''douche'' state that they do so because they believe it offers health benefits, such as cleaning the vagina, rinsing away blood after menstrual periods, avoiding odor, and preventing ''pregnancy'' or infections. However, these beliefs are false, and douching is not necessary to “clean” the vagina. Douching also does not protect against pregnancy or against ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs'').' "
Can douching be harmful?,"'Yes, in some women, douching can lead to the spread of an infection or even the development of an infection by altering the balance of normal bacteria that are present in the vagina, as discussed previously. The risk of both ''bacterial vaginosis'' and sexually-transmitted diseases may be increased by douching. Douching can also cause vaginal irritation.' "
What is the best way to clean the vagina?,"'The vagina produces ''mucus'', which acts as a natural cleansing agent to wash away blood, semen, and ''vaginal discharge''. Washing the outside of the vagina with mild soap and water with regular bathing is sufficient for good hygiene.' "
"Can douching help relieve vaginal discharge, odor, pain, itching, or burning?","'An abnormal ''vaginal odor'', discharge, or discomfort can signal the presence of an infection, so douching to relieve the symptom would only avoid the underlying problem and might even make the infection worse. If you have abnormal ''vaginal odor'' or discharge, ''pain'', burning, or ''itching'"", it's important to see your health-care professional for diagnosis and treatment. Douching before the doctor's visit can make it more difficult to diagnose the problem and recommend the right therapy."" "
Can douching after sex prevent pregnancy?,"'No, douching after sex does not prevent pregnancy and should never be used as a method of ''birth control''.' "
Can douching after sex prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?,'Douching after sex or at any time has no effect in preventing ''STDs''.' 
Can douching affect fertility or pregnancy?,"'Some studies have shown that women who douche regularly take longer to become ''pregnant'' when ''trying to conceive'' than women who do not douche. Other research has shown that douching may damage the Fallopian tubes and lead to an increased risk of ''ectopic pregnancy'' (pregnancy outside the uterus).''In pregnant women, douching was shown in one study to increase the risk of preterm birth by a factor of 1.9.' "
What are natural methods of contraception?,"'Natural methods of ''contraception'' are considered ""natural"" because they are not mechanical and not a result of hormone manipulation. Instead, these methods to prevent pregnancy require that a man and woman not have sexual intercourse during the time when an egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.''The ''fertility'' awareness methods'' (FAMs) are based upon knowing when a woman ovulates each month. In order to use a FAM, it is necessary to watch for the signs and symptoms that indicate ''ovulation'' has occurred or is about to occur.'""On the average, the egg is released about 14 (plus or minus 2) days before a woman's next ""'menstrual period''. But because the egg survives 3 to 4 days (6 to 24 hours after ovulation) and the sperm can live 48 to 72 hours (up to even 5 days in ''fertile'' mucus), the actual time during which a woman may become ''pregnant'' is measured not in hours, not in days, but in weeks.''FAMS can be up to 98% effective, but they require a continuous and conscious commitment with considerable monitoring and self-control. Although these methods were developed to prevent pregnancy, they can equally be well used by a couple to increase fertility and promote ''conception''.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of natural birth control?,"'Natural methods are typically very inexpensive compared to other methods of birth control unless a woman chooses to purchase ovulation test kits.' A woman does not need to take medication or use hormonal manipulation. No procedures or fittings by a physician are required. It can be difficult to estimate or know precisely when a woman is fertile, allowing increased chances for unplanned conception. Natural methods are not as effective as some forms of contraception. Ovulation test kits are used by some couples using natural methods of contraception, and the cost of these kits is another potential disadvantage. Being unable to have intercourse at certain times of the month is a disadvantage for some women."
Calendar rhythm method,"""The calendar rhythm method to avoid pregnancy relies upon calculating a woman's fertile period on the calendar. Based upon her 12 previous menstrual cycles, a woman subtracts l8 days from her shortest menstrual cycle to determine her first fertile day, and 11 days from her longest menstrual cycle to determine her last fertile day. She can then calculate the total number of days during which she may ovulate. If a woman's menstrual cycles are quite irregular from month to month, there will be a greater number of days during which she might become pregnant.""'The calendar method is only about 80% effective in preventing pregnancy and when used alone, it is considered outdated and ineffective.' "
Basal body temperature method,"""The basal body temperature (BBT) method is based upon the fact that a woman's temperature drops 12 to 24 hours before an egg is released from her ovary and then increases again once the egg has been released. Unfortunately, this temperature difference is not very large. It is less than 1 degree F (about a half-degree C) when the body is at rest.""'The basal body temperature method requires that a woman take her temperature every morning before she gets out of bed. A special thermometer that is more accurate and sensitive than a typical oral thermometer must be used, and the daily temperature variations carefully noted. This must be done every month. Online calculators are available to help a woman chart her basal body temperature.''To use the basal body temperature as a birth control method, a woman should refrain from having sexual intercourse from the time her temperature drops until at least 48 to 72 hours after her temperature increases again.' "
Mucus inspection method,"'The mucus inspection method depends on the presence or absence of a particular type of cervical mucus that a woman produces in response to estrogen. A woman will generate larger amounts of more watery mucus than usual (like raw egg white) just before release of an egg from her ovary. This so-called egg-white cervical mucus (EWCM) stretches for up to an inch when pulled apart. A woman can learn to recognize differences in the quantity and quality of her cervical mucus by examining its appearance on her underwear, pads, and toilet tissue; or she may gently remove a sample of mucus from the vaginal opening using two fingers.''She may choose to have intercourse between the time of her ''last menstrual period'' and the time of change in the cervical mucus. During this period, it is recommended that she have sexual intercourse only every other day because the presence of seminal fluid makes it more difficult to determine the nature of her cervical mucus. If the woman does not wish to become pregnant, she should not have sexual intercourse at all for 3 to 4 days after she notices the change in her cervical mucus.' "
Symptothermal method,"'The symptothermal method combines certain aspects of the calendar, the basal body temperature, and the mucus inspection methods. Not only are all these factors taken into consideration, but also are other symptoms such as slight cramping and breast tenderness. Some women experience lower abdominal discomfort (in the area of the ovaries) during the release of an egg (ovulation).' "
Ovulation indicator testing kits,"""A woman can use an ovulation prediction kit to determine when she is most likely to ovulate. This special kit measures the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine. Because luteinizing hormone promotes the maturation of an egg in the ovary, the amount of LH usually increases 20 to 48 hours before ovulation. This increase is called the luteinizing hormone surge, which can then be detected in a woman's urine 8 to 12 hours later. The ovulation prediction kit is designed to measure the amount of luteinizing hormone in the urine.""'There are a number of ovulation prediction kits sold at pharmacies that range from simple to complex. In the simplest, the woman urinates onto a test stick and the amount of luteinizing hormone is indicated by a color change. The intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of luteinizing hormone in her urine. A woman begins testing her urine 2 to 3 days before she expects to ovulate based upon the dates of her previous monthly cycles.''The optimum days for ''fertilization'' are the two days before ovulation, the day of ovulation, and the day after ovulation. The greatest chance of ''becoming pregnant'' is if intercourse occurs within 24 hours after the luteinizing hormone surge. Ovulation prediction kits are used primarily to increase the chance of a woman becoming pregnant, but they can also indicate to the woman that she is about to ovulate and should take appropriate ''contraceptive'' precautions.' "
Withdrawal method,"""Using the withdrawal method, the man withdraws his penis from a woman's vagina before he ejaculates so that the sperm released from his penis does not enter her vagina. Withdrawal is also called ""'coitus interruptus''.'""There are problems with using withdrawal as a contraceptive method. First, a man may release small amounts of sperm before actual ejaculation. Secondly, a man needs self-control and a precise sense of timing to be able to withdraw his penis from the woman's vagina before he ejaculates. Because this can be difficult for the man to complete successfully, the withdrawal method is only about 75%-80% effective in preventing pregnancy."" "
Lactational infertility,"'Lactational ''infertility'' is based upon the idea that a woman cannot become pregnant as long as she is ''breastfeeding'' her baby. It is true that a woman may not ovulate quite as soon after giving birth as she would if she were not breastfeeding. Women who are breastfeeding usually start ovulating again between 10-12 weeks after delivery.''However, the method is not considered appropriate as a sole contraceptive measure. A ''nursing'' mother may start ovulating again and not realize she is fertile, as ovulation can occur prior to the return of her menstrual period. If this happens and the mother has unprotected sexual intercourse, she can become pregnant at the same time she is still breastfeeding her baby. If a nursing mother does not wish to become pregnant again, she must start to use an appropriate method of contraception.' "
Douching and urination,"'Vaginal ''douching'"" is the use of a liquid solution to wash out mucus and other types of bodily debris from a woman's vagina. Many women choose to make regular douching a part of their routine for maintaining vaginal hygiene. Most doctors and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not recommend the practice.""""Regardless of whether a woman does it for hygienic reasons, vaginal douching does not work as a contraception method. During intercourse, active sperm can reach a woman's cervix and even the upper part of her uterus within five minutes of ejaculation. Douching after intercourse cannot be done soon enough to have any contraceptive benefits, and the douching could even force sperm higher up into the uterus. In addition, if a woman douches within a 6-8 hour period after using a spermicide, she may actually reduce the effectiveness of this contraceptive method.""'Some women used to think that standing up and urinating immediately after sexual intercourse might reduce the chances of them becoming pregnant. They hoped that gravity might make it more difficult for sperm to swim ""uphill"" to the uterus and that the stream of urine ''running'' over their vaginal area would wash away sperm, similar to the process of douching. However, just like douching, urination after intercourse does not have any contraceptive value.' "
Abstinence,"""Abstinence from sexual activity means not having any sexual intercourse at all. No sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex means that there is no chance that a man's sperm can fertilize a woman's egg.""""A man or a woman can practice abstinence from sexual activity for a specific period of time, or continuously throughout one's lifetime. Abstinence is essentially 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. Another significant benefit of abstinence is that it markedly reduces the likelihood of contracting a ""'sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'').''In this context, abstinence means refraining from vaginal, anal, and oral sexual activity because sexually transmitted infections can be passed from one person to another in any and all of these ways. It should be noted that sexual activity such as mutual ''masturbation'"" and touching of the other partner's genitals can, in some instances, transfer sperm during heavy mutual foreplay possibly leading to pregnancy."" "
Doula vs. midwife quick comparison of differences,"'Doulas and midwives are both professionals who assist with ''childbirth'' and women’s ''reproductive health''. A doula provides support to the mother before, during, and shortly after ''childbirth'', but does not deliver the baby. A midwife may offer gynecological examinations, ''birth control'' counseling, prescriptions, and ''labor and delivery'' care.''The laws of each state regarding certification and licensing affect the exact types of services that a midwife can perform.' "
What is a doula? Can a doula deliver babies?,"'A doula provides physical, emotional, and informational support to an expectant mother before, during, and after ''childbirth''. A doula focuses on an expectant mother’s own needs, which enables her to have a memorable and empowering experience while giving birth. While in most cases the term “doula,” implies a professional who is present during the birth, there also are doulas who specialize in antepartum (before birth) care and postpartum care. A doula typically helps a woman prepare a birth plan.''A birth doula remains with the mother during birth, offering relaxation and ''breathing'' technique support, as well as comforting services like ''massage'', and assistance with labor positions; however, doulas are not medically trained, and cannot deliver babies. A doula is not a substitute for having a woman’s partner at the birth. Doulas encourage participation from the partner, and offer support and reassurance to the partner as well.' "
What is a midwife? Can a midwife deliver a baby?,"'A midwife is a health care professional. Depending upon the laws of the US state in which the midwife practices, a midwife may perform gynecological examinations (for example, Pap smears, pelvic exams, and breast exams), write prescriptions, care for a woman during labor and delivery, perform fetal monitoring, and provide information about ''contraception''. A midwife usually seeks to eliminate or minimize unnecessary technological interventions, believing that ''pregnancy'' and birth are normal life processes. However, a midwife also is skilled at identifying and referring women who need the services of an obstetrician during the birth.\xa0A midwife is medically trained and qualified to deliver babies.''Some midwives also are trained as nurses. A nurse-midwife usually can offer the greatest variety of health-care services to women.' "
Do doulas and midwives require certifications?,"'The American Midwifery Certification Board (AMCB) is the US national certifying body for certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) and certified midwives (CMs). Midwifery education programs involve graduate study and usually require a Bachelors Degree for entry. Some programs will accept applicants with a Bachelor’s degree in a field other than ''nursing'', while others require a Bachelor’s degree in nursing. Midwifery education programs in the United States are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Midwifery Education (ACME). According to the AMCB, legal recognition for CNMs and CMs varies among states.''A doula does not necessarily have medical training, and there is no formal licensing required. However, many doulas choose training and certification by organizations that oversee doula training programs, such as DONA International™ and the Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (CAPPA).' "
Similarities between doula vs. midwife, 
Differences between a doula vs. midwife,"'A doula and a midwife offer different types of services, even though both may support the childbirth experience.''Midwives have medical training and during the birth process, focus on delivering a healthy baby.''Doulas, on the other hand, focus on the needs of the mother, offering mental, physical, and emotional support. Doulas do not have medical training or experience and cannot be used a substitute for a midwife or doctor.' "
Can I use both a doula and midwife for my pregnancy and birth?,"'Yes, many women opt to use both a doula and midwife, although it is not required that a woman use both if using one or the other.' "
When should a doctor be consulted during pregnancy or assisted birth?,"'A midwife is trained to recognize an emergency or situation that requires medical care from a doctor. Midwives are trained to handle normal ''pregnancies'', but obstetrical care is required for certain situations, and for pregnancies deemed to be at high risk. Many doctors have nurse-midwives in their practices that work alongside your doctor’s team, and may manage normal pregnancies if the woman wishes.''Obstetricians (OB-GYN physicians) can manage high-risk pregnancies and can perform surgeries, including C-sections, when necessary. Midwives are prohibited from performing C-sections or using forceps and vacuums during the delivery process. The midwife will seek obstetrical care by a doctor should a birth complication arise that requires one of these interventions, or an emergency that threatens the mother or baby.' "
How much does a doula cost? How much does a midwife cost?,"'The costs for doulas and midwives, as for any health-care service, vary according to the specific provider and the geographic location. A doula typically charges a flat fee for service, meaning an agreed-upon number of prenatal visits, being on-call for support during your pregnancy, support during your labor and birth, and at least one postpartum visit. Other services may be included in the package. The costs for a doula can be $1,000 or more in major cities and substantially less in other areas.''For a midwife, the cost also varies by location. An average cost of a midwife is around $2,000, but midwives’ fees may be covered by some insurance policies. These fees typically cover all prenatal visits, the birth, and postpartum visits. Some midwives may offer sliding scales, reduced fees, or payment plans for some women.' "
What is Down syndrome?,"'Down syndrome'' is a ''genetic disorder'' and the most common autosomal chromosome abnormality in humans, where extra genetic material from chromosome 21 is transferred to a newly formed embryo. These extra genes and DNA cause changes in the development of the embryo and fetus resulting in physical and mental abnormalities. Each patient is unique and there can be great variability in the severity of symptoms.'  "
What causes Down syndrome?,"'Normally, the ''human body'' has 23 pairs of chromosomes (called autosomes) and two sex chromosomes (allosomes). At ''conception'', a new cell is formed that receives one copy of each chromosome from the sperm and one copy from the egg. The new cell divides and multiplies to form an embryo and ultimately a fetus and new human. Each cell contains the exact same genetic material as the original 46 chromosomes, carrying the same genes and DNA.''In patients with Down syndrome, an error occurs in the coming together of chromosome 21. The extra genetic material is responsible for the developmental abnormalities that occur. Instead of 46 chromosomes plus two sex chromosomes, there are 47.''The most common error in chromosome replication is trisomy 21, where the new cell gets three copies of chromosome 21, instead of two. This accounts for about 95% of those patients with Down syndrome. Translocation describes a less common event where an extra piece of chromosome 21 gets attached to another chromosome, again delivering more genetic material to the new cell than is needed.'""Mosaic Down syndrome occurs when there is a combination of cells with the normal number of chromosomes (46+2) mixed together with those containing a third chromosome 21 (47+2). The cells with normal chromosomes can moderate the effect of the trisomy 21 cells and modify the effect on the patient's physical and mental development.""'Genotype is the term used to describe the genetic ''makeup'' of a person and for most Down syndrome patients, it is 47+2. Phenotype describes the physical and functional capabilities of a patient. In patients with Down syndrome there is great variability in phenotype.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Down syndrome?,"'The baby with Down syndrome has a hallmark appearance. However, every aspect of the appearance does not need to be present as the phenotype, the way the genes make the child look, can be markedly different for each patient.''6 Common ''Down syndrome symptoms'' are:\xa0''The patient may have growth retardation and though as a baby may be normal size, will not grow as tall. The average height for an adult male with Down syndrome is 5 ft 1 in and for a female it is 4 ft 9 in. Bowleggedness is common. ''Obesity'' occurs with ''aging''.''There is decreased mental function and the IQ may range from mild disability (50 to 70) to moderate (35 to 50). For patients with Mosaic Down syndrome, IQ can be 10 to 30 points higher. There can be language development delay both from ''hearing impairment'' and speech delay. Gross motor skills like crawling and ''walking'' can be slow to mature and fine motor skills may take time to develop.'   there are a small head and short neck, a flat face, and upward slanting eyes,  ears are flat and positioned lower than “normal,” the tongue protrudes and seems to be too large for the mouth, hands tend to be wide, with short fingers and there is just a single flexion crease in the palm, and joints tend to be more flexible and muscles may lack tone."
How do doctors diagnose Down syndrome?,"'Most often, Down syndrome is diagnosed while the fetus is still in the uterus (see tests below). Routine screening is recommended by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology in all ''pregnancies'"", regardless of the mother's age.""'In the first and second ''trimesters'' of ''pregnancy'', blood tests and ''ultrasound'' may be used to screen for not only Down syndrome, but also ''spina bifida'' and other genetic abnormalities. Should these screening tests show the potential for Down syndrome, specific diagnostic test may be considered. These include the following:''There is a small risk of ''miscarriage'' with these tests. The decision as to which test might be best and when it should be done depends upon the situation and is made jointly with mother and the health care professional.''At birth, Down syndrome is usually diagnosed by the appearance of the ''newborn'' and the health care professional will likely order a chromosome analysis to confirm the diagnosis.'   Amniocentesis: A needle is placed using ultrasound guidance into the uterus to obtain a sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus. The fetus' chromosomes can be analyzed, looking for trisomy 21. Chorionic villus sampling: Cells are taken from the placenta for fetal chromosome analysis."
What is the treatment for Down syndrome?,"'Providing support and treatment for a patient with Down syndrome is meant to improve their quality of life.''Infants with Down syndrome may experience developmental delays including time to sit, crawl, walk, and talk so parents need to know that developmental delays are common in children with Down syndrome. Using a team approach to care, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists may help improve language, motor, and social skills to the maximum achievable by the individual person.''Medical conditions associated with Down syndrome, including those affecting the ''heart'' or the gastrointestinal system, may require evaluation and care, sometimes requiring surgery.''As the patient ages, the care and support needed will depend upon the intellectual ability and physical function achievable by the individual.' "
What are the potential complications of Down syndrome?,"'The extra genetic material can affect all organs in the body and complications may rise at birth or may present later in life.' Congenital heart disease may affect up to 50% of patients. Most commonly found are endocardial cushion defects (also known as atrial septal defects) and ventricular septal defects. Both are “holes” in the walls that connect the upper (atrium) and lower (ventricle) chambers of the heart. There can be many abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract, including duodenal atresia (failure for the first part of the small intestine to fully develop), imperforate anus, and Hirschsprung's disease where the nerves to the anus fail to develop appropriately. Gastroesophageal reflux is common and may lead to aspiration of stomach contents into the lungs leading to recurrent pneumonia. Celiac disease is common in Down syndrome. Common eye problems include nearsightedness, astigmatism, and strabismus (imbalanced eye muscles). Cataracts can develop in utero and lead to blindness. Glaucoma, which causes increased eye pressure, is also seen. Tear ducts may be blocked leading to recurrent eye infections. Because of the abnormal facial anatomy, recurrent ear infections are common and can lead to deafness. As well, the large tongue and smallmouth are potential risk factors for developing sleep apnea. Patients with Down syndrome are more prone to autoimmune diseases including hypothyroidism, diabetes, and celiac disease. Children are more prone to infections. Patients with Down syndrome have a higher risk to develop leukemia. There is an increased risk for cervical spine instability, especially at the atlantoaxial junction, the joint that connects the first and second vertebrae in the neck. This can potentially be dangerous should there be subluxation or excessive movement that can damage the spinal cord. Most children will require a neck X-ray only if they will be participating in sports such as the Special Olympics. Scoliosis, hip dislocations, and knee laxity are other orthopedic issues that are prevalent."
What is the prognosis for someone with Down syndrome?,"'With increased understanding of potential underlying illnesses associated with Down syndrome and with increased support within the community for patient and family, quality of life for the patient has increased in recent years. There is great variability in mental function between patients, but for those with the appropriate mental capacity, the ability to complete an education, live, and work independently.''Down syndrome patients tend to age more quickly and are prone to developing '""Alzheimer's""' disease, often as young as age 40. Those patients who maintain their mental capacity tend to have a ''longer life'' span. A poorer prognosis is found in those patients who develop ''dementia'', lose their ability to perform daily physical activities, and those who have decreased vision.' "
What is the life expectancy for someone with Down syndrome?,"'Because of the many physical complications associated with chromosomal abnormalities, many fetuses with trisomy 21 fail to develop properly and are miscarried. There is an increased risk of infant death in the first year of life because of congenital ''heart disease'' (failure of the heart to develop normally) and respiratory infections.''Given the challenges in the infant years, patients with Down syndrome have experienced increased life expectancy as recognition and treatment of underlying medical conditions improve. A person with Down syndrome can expect a life span of 50 years and more, depending upon the severity of underlying medical issues.' "
Is it possible to prevent Down syndrome?,"'Down syndrome is not an illness or disease to be prevented but instead, an unexplained error in replicating DNA, genes, and chromosomes at the earliest stages of embryo development.''There is a relationship between the age of the mother and the risk of having a child with Down syndrome. The overall frequency of a Down child is approximately 1 in 691 live births, but the older the mother, the higher the frequency. For mothers 34 years old and younger, Down syndrome frequency is 1 in 1,500 live births and the frequency gradually rises, so that for mothers older than age 45, it is 1 in 50 live births.''For couples who have a child with Down syndrome, there is increased risk to have a second child with Down syndrome. Women with Down syndrome are capable of ''becoming pregnant'' and are at increased risk of having another child with Down syndrome.' "
"Urinary incontinence products for men 
introduction","'Lots of men hate the idea of using ''incontinence'' products ''--'' the so-called adult diapers, urine collection ''bags'"", and catheters. But if you're having a problem with male ""'incontinence'"", these products can really help. They can prevent embarrassing accidents, simplify your life, and increase your confidence. Here's a rundown of some of your options."" "
What are urinary incontinence pads and other absorbent products?,"'Incontinence pads and other absorbent products.'"" While women grow up using pads (albeit of a different sort), men can find the idea pretty weird and distressing. But these incontinence products can be enormously helpful. They can prevent leaking onto your clothes, control odor, and prevent skin irritation. What's more, just knowing that you're protected can make you feel a lot better.""""Of course, there are so many types available that you may not know where to start. The best choice depends on your symptoms. If you're just having occasional leaking or dribble, a""' drip collector'' ''--'' an absorbent padded sheath that goes around the penis -- might do the trick. For mild cases,'' an incontinence pad i'""nserted into the underwear and held in place with an adhesive strip might work. If you're having more severe incontinence, a larger ""'guard'' or pair of absorbent ''underwear '""may be what you need. Some briefs are washable; others are disposable. If you're confused about what type will work best for you, just ask your doctor for advice. It may take some experimentation before you find a type of incontinence product that works and feels comfortable for you."" "
What are urinary incontinence external catheters?,"'External catheters.'"" Unlike the catheters used at the hospital, external catheters for male incontinence are silicone or latex devices that go over the penis instead of into the urethra. They're usually rolled on like ""'condoms'"". The urine is sent through a tube into a drainage bag. Some men only use these devices at night. To prevent leaks, it's very important to get the right fit and to follow the instructions from the manufacturer."" "
What are urinary incontinence drainage bags?,"'Drainage bags.'' These are just the ''plastic'' bags that you would attach to a catheter. Larger ones are called ""bedside bags"" and are hung near the bed. Smaller ones can be worn on the body, attached to the abdomen or leg with straps. ' "
What are urinary incontinence underpads?,'Underpads.'' These incontinence products are basic waterproof pads or covers that can be placed on furniture or mattresses to protect against leaks. They add an extra level of protection. ' 
What are urinals and other toilet substitutes?,"'Urinals and other toilet substitutes. '""When getting to the bathroom isn't possible, ""'plastic'' urinals can be a big help for male incontinence. These are plastic containers that a man can urinate into. They may be particularly helpful if you have urge incontinency, which makes it tough to get to the bathroom fast enough. You can keep one by the bed and another in the car in case you get stuck somewhere without a bathroom.' "
What are urinary incontinence penile clamps?,"'Penile clamps.'' They may sound unpleasant, but for certain men, penile clamps ''--'' also called ""external compression devices"" ''--'"" can make a big difference. A small amount of pressure exerted on the penis can temporarily close off the urethra, stopping any potential leakage. The part that fits around the penis is soft foam and shouldn't be uncomfortable. These devices aren't right for everyone, so talk to your doctor. Using them too often could cause circulation problems, skin irritation, and strictures. Generally, they're only meant to be used for a couple of hours at a time."" "
Where can you find men's urinary incontinence products?,"'Incontinence pads and disposable undergarments are usually available at drugstores and supermarkets. For other male incontinence products, a medical supply store might be your best bet.'""If you're anxious about buying incontinence products publicly, just look online. You should be able to find just about anything you want at an online superstore or online medical supply company. However, before spending a lot of money on a male incontinence product, check with a doctor to make sure it's likely to help."" "
How do you use male urinary incontinence products?,"""Some guys don't want to try ""'urinary incontinence'"" products because they feel like it's a sign of defeat. Once they start buying pads, they think, they'll be stuck buying them for the rest of their lives. But remember that a lot of men may only need incontinence products temporarily. For instance, if you've just had prostate surgery, using some of these products may help get you through while you're healing. Other men rely on incontinence products for a short time while their doctors figure out the underlying cause of their problems.""'Think of incontinence products as valuable tools to help you get by.

What is drowning and what are the statistics?,"'According to WHO, ""Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid."" The possible outcomes of drowning are classified as death, morbidity (the development of disability or injury), and no morbidity.'""This simple definition was agreed upon at the 2002 World Congress of Drowning held in Amsterdam. Prior to that meeting, some definitions and classifications of drowning were not necessarily well defined, and their meanings were subject to a variety of interpretations by different countries and health organizations. While some people still try to sort drowning events into categories (for example wet vs. dry, primary vs. secondary, fatal vs. nonfatal), these terms may or may not adequately describe a patient's situation, the effects of drowning on their body, or the potential outcome."" Drowning is the third most common cause of accidental death worldwide, accounting for 7% of all injury related deaths. According to WHO, more than 350,000 people die every year from drowning. This number significantly underestimates the actual number because they do not include those who drown in floods, boating, or water transport accidents. Almost half of all drowning in the world occur in China and India. The death rate from drowning does not reflect the potential morbidity (disability) due to brain injury for those who survive a drowning episode. Most countries do not keep nonfatal drowning statistics."
What happens during drowning?,"'Drowning occurs when water comes into contact with the larynx (voice box).'   After an initial gasp, there is a period of voluntary breath holding. This is followed by spasm of the larynx and the development of hypoxemia (hypo=low + ox=oxygen + emia=blood), or decreased levels of oxygen in the bloodstream. Lack of oxygen causes aerobic metabolism to stop, and the body becomes acidotic. If not corrected quickly, the lack of oxygen in combination with too much acid may lead to problems with the electrical conduction system of the heart (cardiac arrest) and lack of blood supply to the brain. As body function declines, aspiration may occur as the larynx relaxes, allowing water to enter the lungs. However, up to 20% of drowning victims have persistent spasm of the larynx, and no water is aspirated (this was formerly known as ""dry"" drowning)."
Does the type of drowning matter?,'There have been a variety of theories reported regarding the potential responses of the body to different drowning situations. Most discuss dry vs. wet drowning and salt vs. fresh water drowning.' 
Wet vs. dry drowning,"'Most drownings are unwitnessed, and the victim is found floating. While only a small amount of aspirated water is required to cause significant problems with lung function, it is the prolonged submersion time and lack of breathing that causes complications due to hypoxemia.''Approximately 10% to 20% of drowning victims have dry drowning with no water found in the lungs at ''autopsy'', but even most wet drowning victims have less than 4cc/kg of water found in their lungs. For a 50 pound child, this amounts to less than 3 ounces of water.' "
Salt vs. fresh water drowning,"'In the lung, the breathing tubes (trachea, bronchi, ''bronchioles'') branch into smaller and smaller segments until they end in an air pocket called an alveolus (plural alveoli). This is the part of the lung where air and ''red blood cells'' in capillary blood vessels come near enough to allow the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the two. Alveoli are covered with a chemical called surfactant that allows the air pocket to open and close easily when breathing occurs.''When fresh water enters an alveolus, it destroys the surfactant and causes the alveoli to collapse, unable to open with breathing. A mismatch can develop where blood is pumped to parts of lung where no oxygen is available to be absorbed. This may lead to a decrease in the concentration of oxygen in the blood called a ventilation-perfusion mismatch.'""Salt water doesn't destroy surfactant; rather it washes it away and damages the membrane between the alveolus and the capillary blood vessel. Once again, the body sends blood flow to areas of the lung that aren't able to provide it oxygen, and hypoxemia occurs.""'Regardless of the type of water, lung function is compromised because of the lack of surfactant, and the effect it has on lung function. In some circumstances, ''electrolyte'' abnormalities may occur with fresh water drowning.' "
What are the risk factors of drowning?,"'There are two peak ages for drowning: children aged younger than 4 and young adults aged 15 to 25.'   Infants less than 1 year old most often drown in bathtubs. Children younger than age 5 most commonly drown in residential swimming pools. Young adults tend to drown in larger bodies of water (for example, rivers and lakes). Neck fractures caused by diving into shallow water are associated with drowning in this age group. Alcohol is also implicated in up to 50% of drownings in this age group. Medical emergencies that occur in the water also can lead to drowning. These may include, among others, seizures, heart attack (myocardial infarction), sudden cardiac death, and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar in a person with diabetes)."
What are the symptoms of drowning?,"'The consequences and symptoms of drowning vary widely. A drowning victim may show no symptoms and have no complaints, or may be found dead.''It is the rare person who is found thrashing in water. Instead, most drownings are unwitnessed and the person is found floating or submerged in the water.''For those who are alive, they may be anxious, confused, and short of breath. Brain function and lung function are the main concerns in drowning victims.''Young children may have a mammalian diving reflex that occurs when drowning occurs in very ''cold'' water. When suddenly immersed in cold water less than 68 F (20 C), victims can stop breathing, slow their heart rate dramatically, and shunt all the blood flow to the heart and brain. Though not common, these children may be resuscitated and return to normal function. Cases of survival have been reported, even after being underwater for an hour.' "
When should one seek medical care for drowning?,"'All individuals who are victims of drowning, even if they have no symptoms, should be evaluated by a health care professional. Sometimes, subtle information will be revealed that may make the diagnosis of an underlying medical condition.' "
How is drowning diagnosed?,"'The initial evaluation of any drowning victim will begin with a history of the events.''Physical examination will begin with taking and monitoring the vital signs (the ABCs will be evaluated -- ''airway'', breathing, and circulation). Careful examination of the whole body will be required, especially focusing on the neurological examination to assess brain function. Lung and heart examination will also be performed.''If trauma or a diving injury is a consideration, the neck and spine may be immobilized to protect against potential spinal cord damage.''Laboratory and X-ray testing will be utilized depending upon the situation and potential injuries.' How old is the patient? Are there any underlying medical problems? Does the patient take any prescription or non-prescription medications? Is there a history of drug or alcohol use? How long was the person unattended prior to being found? Was there any potential trauma associated with the drowning (diving/falling into the water/falling out of a boat, falling through ice)? Was there loss of consciousness before, during, or after the drowning episode? Did the patient have a witnessed seizure? Did the person complain of chest pain and was he or she a victim of sudden cardiac arrest before falling into the water? Has there been any change in behavior after being removed from the water? Has the person had vomiting?"
How is drowning treated?,"""Treatment begins at the water's edge. The American Heart Association recommends, if possible, sending one person to activate emergency medical services and to call 911. Send another person to bring an automatic external ""'defibrillator'"" (AED) to the victim's side.""'If no pulse can be identified and the patient is not breathing, start CPR. Drowning is one of the special situations where hands-only CPR is NOT indicated. If there is a potential for a ''neck injury'', take special care to prevent further injury to the victim by keeping the neck and body in alignment.''If the patient is breathing but not awake, place the person on his or her side in the rescue position to prevent aspiration if ''vomiting'' should occur.'   Further treatment by EMTs, paramedics, and staff at the hospital will depend upon the severity of the symptoms. Those patients who have no symptoms may require nothing more than observation. Those who are in cardiopulmonary arrest will likely undergo CPR with attempts to restore a regular heart rhythm and heartbeat. Those patients who have symptoms related to the function of their heart, lung, or brain will need further evaluation and treatment tailored to their specific circumstances and situation. And, unfortunately, for those who are found dead with no potential for resuscitation, further treatment or evaluation may not be indicated."
What are the complications of drowning?," Hypoxemia causing brain damage is the major complication in drowning victims who do not die. Direct lung tissue damage caused by water aspirated into the lung can also occur and may lead to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). If the drowning occurs in colder water, there is the risk of hypothermia or a drop in core body temperature. Drowning may occur as a consequence of injury or illness. For example, cervical spine fractures (broken neck) due to diving injuries may result in breathing problems and subsequent drowning. Drowning can occur as a result of syncope or loss of consciousness in the water, due to a variety of medical conditions including heart attack and seizure."
How can drowning be prevented?,"'Most drownings are preventable, and simple steps can be taken to help with water safety.'  Learn how to swim. When in the water, use the buddy system. Do not use alcohol or drugs when swimming or boating. Supervise children closely around water and make certain they are the focus of your attention. Even bathtubs and buckets full of water can be dangerous. Swimming pools should have barriers (fences, gates, alarms) to prevent children from entering unattended. Learn CPR."
What is the prognosis for a drowning victim?,"'The prognosis for many drowning victims is poor. The brain does not tolerate lack of oxygen well and the amount of potential damage is dependent upon the time the patient spends hypoxemic in the water.''Even if the brain survives, ''acute respiratory distress syndrome'' (''ARDS'') may cause significant short- and long-term problems as the lungs try to recover from their injuries.''The key to the treatment of drowning is ''prevention''.' "
Facts you should know about drug use disorder,"   Drug abuse and addiction, now both grouped as substance or drug use disorder, is a condition characterized by a self-destructive pattern of using a substance that leads to significant problems and distress, which may include tolerance to or withdrawal from the substance. Drug use disorder is unfortunately quite common, affecting more than 8% of people in the United States at some point in their lives. Dual diagnosis refers to the presence of both a drug-use issue in addition to a serious mental health condition in an individual. People can abuse virtually any substance whose ingestion can result in a euphoric (""high"") feeling. Inhalants like household cleaners are some of the most commonly abused substances. While the specific physical and psychological effects of drug use disorder tend to vary based on the particular substance involved, the general effects of a substance use disorder involving any drug can be devastating. Although drug use disorders have no single cause, there are a number of biological, psychological, and social risk factors that can predispose a person to developing a chemical use disorder. Symptoms of a drug problem include recurrent drug use that results in legal problems, occurs in potentially dangerous situations, interfere with important obligations, results in social or relationship problems, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, using a lot of the drug or for a long period of time, persistent desire to use the drug, unsuccessful efforts to stop using the drug, neglecting other aspects of life because of their drug use, and spending inordinate amounts of time or energy getting, using, or recovering from the effects of the drug. While the specific effects of drugs on the brain can somewhat vary depending on the drug that is being used, virtually every substance that is abused has an effect on the executive-functioning areas of the brain. Drugs particularly affect the brain's ability to inhibit actions that the person would otherwise delay or prevent. Since there is no single test that can definitively diagnose someone with a chemical use disorder, health care professionals assess these disorders by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health information, as well as securing a physical examination and lab tests to assess the sufferer's medical state. Treatment options for substance abuse disorders remain largely underutilized by most people who suffer from these conditions. The primary goals of recovery are abstinence, relapse prevention, and rehabilitation. During the initial stage of abstinence, a person who suffers from chemical dependency may need detoxification treatment to help avoid or lessen the effects of withdrawal. Often, much more challenging and time-consuming than recovery from the physical aspects of addiction is psychological addiction. The treatment of dual diagnosis is more effective when treatment of the sufferer's mental illness occurs in tandem with the treatment of the individual's chemical dependency. Drug addiction increases the risk of a number of negative life stressors and conditions, particularly if left untreated. Episodes of remaining drug free (remission) and relapse characterize recovery from a substance use disorder."
What is drug use disorder?,"'Formerly separately called substance or drug abuse and addiction, drug use disorder, also called substance use or chemical use disorder, is an illness characterized by a destructive pattern of using a substance that leads to significant problems or distress, including tolerance to or withdrawal from the substance, as well as other problems that use of the substance can cause for the sufferer, either socially or in terms of their work or school performance. The effects of drug use disorders on society are substantial. The economic cost, including everything from lost wages to medical, legal, and mental health implications is about $215 billion. The cultivation of ''marijuana'' and production of synthetic drugs like methamphetamine has negative impact on soil and water supplies. Drug law infractions are a highly common reason for arrest in the United States, with more than 1.5 million occurring in 2016.''Teens'' are increasingly engaging in prescription drug abuse, particularly narcotics, also called opioids (which physicians prescribe to relieve severe ''pain'') and stimulant medications, which treat conditions like attention-deficit disorder and ''narcolepsy''.''The term dual diagnosis refers to the presence of both a drug use disorder and a serious mental health problem in a person. Substance use disorders, unfortunately, occur quite commonly in people who also have severe mental illness. Individuals with dual diagnosis are also at higher risk of being noncompliant with treatment.' "
What types of drugs do people commonly abuse?,"'Individuals may abuse almost any substance whose ingestion can result in a euphoric (""high"") feeling. While many are aware of the abuse of legal substances like ''alcohol'' or illegal drugs like marijuana (in most states) and ''cocaine'', less well-known is the fact that inhalants like household cleaners and ''over-the-counter'' medications like ''cold'' medicines are some of the most commonly abused substances. The following are many of the drugs and types of drugs that people commonly abuse and/or result in dependence:' Alcohol: Although legal, alcohol is a toxic substance, especially for a developing fetus when a mother consumes this drug during pregnancy. One of the most common addictions, alcoholism can have devastating effects on the alcoholic individual's physical well-being, as well as his or her ability to function interpersonally and at work. Amphetamines: This group of drugs comes in many forms, from prescription medications like methylphenidate (for example, Ritalin, Concerta, Focalin) and dextroamphetamine and amphetamine (Adderall) to illegally manufactured drugs like methamphetamine (""crystal meth""). Overdose of any of these substances can result in seizure and death. Anabolic steroids: A group of substances that is most often abused by bodybuilders and other athletes, this group of drugs can lead to devastating emotional symptoms like aggression and paranoia, as well as severe long-term physical effects like infertility and organ failure. Caffeine: While many people consume coffee, tea, and soda, when consumed in excess, this substance can be habit-forming and produce palpitations, insomnia, tremors, irritability, and significant anxiety. Cannabis: More usually called marijuana, the scientific name for cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug, with nearly 14 million people 12 years or older reporting having used this drug in the past year. In addition to the negative effects the drug itself can produce (for example, infertility, difficulties with sexual performance, paranoia, lack of motivation), the fact that it is commonly mixed (cut) with other substances so drug dealers can make more money selling the diluted substance or expose the user to more addictive drugs exposes the marijuana user to the dangers associated with those added substances. People commonly cut marijuana with ingredients that include baby powder, oregano, embalming fluid, phencyclidine (PCP), opiates, and cocaine. Cathinones (bath salts): Chemically unrelated to bath salts that people use to bathe, cathinones are chemically similar to stimulant drugs, like amphetamines, cocaine, and Ecstasy (MDMA). In addition to bath salts, other street names for cathinones include ""plant food,"" ""jewelry cleaner,"" or ""phone screen cleaner."" Cocaine: A drug that tends to stimulate the nervous system, people can snort cocaine in powder form, smoke it when in the form of rocks (""crack"" cocaine), or inject it when made into a liquid. Ecstasy: Also called MDMA to denote its chemical composition (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), this drug tends to create a sense of euphoria and an expansive love or desire to nurture others. In overdose, it can increase body temperature to the point of causing death. Hallucinogens: Examples include LSD and mescaline, as well as so-called naturally occurring hallucinogens like certain mushrooms. These drugs can be dangerous in their ability to alter the perceptions of the user. For example, a person who is intoxicated (""high"" on) with a hallucinogen may perceive danger where there is none and to think that situations that are truly dangerous are not. Those misperceptions can result in dangerous behaviors (like jumping out of a window because the person thinks they have wings and can fly). Inhalants: One of the most commonly abused group of substances due to its easy accessibility, inhalants are usually in household cleaners, like ammonia, bleach, and other substances that emit fumes. Brain damage, to the point of death, can result from using an inhalant even just once or over the course of time, depending on the individual. Nicotine: The addictive substance found in cigarettes, nicotine is actually one of the most addictive substances that exists. In fact, people often compare nicotine addiction to the intense addictiveness associated with opiates like heroin. Opiates: People also call this group narcotics or opioids and includes drugs like heroin, codeine, hydrocodone, morphine, methadone, Vicodin, OxyContin, Percocet, and Percodan. This group of substances sharply decrease the functioning of the nervous system. The lethality of opioids is often the result of the abuser having to use increasingly higher amounts to achieve the same level of intoxication, ultimately to the point that the dose needed to get high is the same as the dose that is lethal by overdose for that individual by halting the person's breathing (respiratory arrest). Phencyclidine: Commonly called PCP, this drug can cause the user to feel highly suspicious, become very aggressive, and to have an exceptional amount of physical strength. This can make the person quite dangerous to others. Sedative, hypnotic, or antianxiety drugs: The second most commonly used group of illicit drugs, these substances quiet or depress the nervous system. They can therefore cause death by stopping the breathing (respiratory arrest) of the individual who either uses these drugs in overdose or who mixes one or more of these drugs with another nervous system depressant (like alcohol, another sedative drug, or an opiate)."
What are the physical and psychological effects of drug use disorders?,"'While the specific physical and psychological effects of drug use disorders tend to vary based on the particular substance involved, the general effects of addiction to any drug can be devastating. Psychologically, intoxication with or withdrawal from a substance can cause everything from ''euphoria'' as with alcohol, Ecstasy, or inhalant intoxication, to paranoia with marijuana or steroid intoxication, to severe ''depression'' or ''suicidal thoughts'' with cocaine or amphetamine withdrawal. In terms of effects on the body, intoxication with a drug can cause physical effects that range from marked sleepiness and slowed breathing as with intoxication with heroin or sedative ''hypnotic drugs'', to the rapid ''heart'' rate of cocaine intoxication, or the ''tremors'' to ''seizures'' of ''alcohol withdrawal''.' "
What are causes and risk factors for developing a drug use disorder?,"""Like most other mental health problems, drug use disorders have no single cause and are not the result of a lack of discipline or self-control. There are a number of biological, psychological, and social factors, known as risk factors, which can increase an individual's vulnerability to developing a chemical use disorder. The frequency with which substance use disorders occur within some families seems to be higher than could be explained by an addictive environment of the family. Therefore, most substance use professionals recognize a genetic aspect to the risk of drug addiction.""'Psychological associations with substance abuse or addiction include mood disorders like early aggressive behaviors, ''depression'', ''anxiety'', or ''bipolar disorder'', thought disorders like ''schizophrenia'', as well as personality disorders like ''antisocial personality disorder''. Social risk factors for drug abuse and addiction include male gender, being between the ages of 18 and 44 Native-American heritage, unmarried marital status, and lower socioeconomic status. According to statistics by state, people residing in the West tend to be at a somewhat higher risk for chemical dependency. While men are more at risk for developing a chemical dependency like alcoholism, women seem to be more vulnerable to becoming addicted to alcohol at much lower amounts of alcohol consumption compared to men.''Adults exposed to negative events as children are at higher risk of developing drug use disorders. In addition to poverty, examples of such negative events include lack of parental supervision, the presence of parental substance abuse, witnessing ''domestic violence'', or being the victim of emotional, physical or sexual abuse.' "
What are warning signs that you or a loved one may have a drug use disorder?,"'While specific symptoms that are used to diagnose drug use disorders are described below, warning signs that you or a loved one suffer from a drug-related problem include the following:' Having blackouts or loss of memory Mood problems like irritability, sadness, or mood swings Repeated arguments with loved ones Repeatedly using drugs to cope with problems Physical symptoms when abstaining from drug use Physical problems due to drug use Repeatedly using more drugs or using drugs for longer than intended Spending less time on life obligations due to drug use Needing more drug to get high than one used to"
What are symptoms and signs of drug use disorder?,"'According to the ''DSM-5'' (the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition''), the diagnostic reference that is written and endorsed by the American Psychiatric Association, in order to be diagnosed with substance-related use disorder, a person must exhibit a maladaptive pattern of drug use that leads to significant problems or ''stress'', as manifested by at least two of the following signs or symptoms in the same one-year period:'   Recurrent substance use that prevents the sufferer from meeting significant responsibilities at work, school, or home Recurrent drug use despite significant resulting drug-related problems in the person's life (for example, in situations that may be physically dangerous, cause recurrent legal problems as a result of drug use; repeated social or relationship problems as a result of or worsened by the drug's effects) Recurrent legal problems as a result of drug use Continued drug use in spite of continued or repeated social or relationship problems as a result of, or worsened by the drug's effects Tolerance, which is either a markedly decreased effect of the drug or a need to significantly increase the amount of the substance used in order to experience the same high or other desired effects Withdrawal, which is defined as either physical or psychological signs or symptoms consistent with withdrawal from a specific drug, or taking that drug or one chemically close to that drug in order to avoid developing symptoms of withdrawal Larger amounts of the drug are taken or for longer than intended. The person has a persistent urge to take the drug or has unsuccessfully tried to decrease or control the drug use A person spends excessive amounts of time either getting, using, or recovering from the effects of the drug Cravings/strong urges to use the substance. The person significantly lessens or stops engaging in important social, recreational, work, or school activities because of the substance use The person engages in negative decision-making, in that he or she continues to use the drug despite knowing that he or she suffers from ongoing or recurring physical or psychological problems caused or worsened by the use of the drug."
What happens to your brain when you take drugs?,"""While the specific effects of drugs on the brain can vary somewhat depending on the drug that people abuse, virtually every drug that is abused has an effect on what professionals often call the executive functioning areas of the brain. The functions of those areas can be remembered by thinking about the tasks of the chief executive officer in any company: planning, organizing, prioritizing, acting when it is time to act, as well as delaying or preventing action (inhibitory functions) when appropriate. The parts of the brain that tend to harbor the executive brain functions are the front-most parts of the brain, called the frontal lobes, including the frontal cortex and prefrontal cortex. When a person takes drugs, the inhibitory functions of the brain are particularly impaired, causing the person to have trouble stopping him or herself from acting on impulses that the brain would otherwise delay or prevent. This disinhibition can lead to the substance abuser engaging in aggressive, sexual, criminal, dangerous, or other activities that can have devastating consequences for the addicted person or those around him or her. Given that the brain of individuals below about the age of 25 years is in the process of actively and rapidly developing and is therefore not fully mature, drug use that takes place during the childhood or teenage years can have particularly negative effects on the younger person's ability to perform all these essential executive functions."" "
How do health care professionals diagnose drug addiction?,"""Similar to many mental health diagnoses, there is no one test that definitively determines that someone has a chemical use disorder. Therefore, health care professionals diagnose these conditions by thoroughly gathering medical, family, and mental health information. The practitioner will also either conduct a physical examination or ask that the person's primary care doctor perform one. The medical assessment will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general medical health and to explore whether or not the individual currently has drugs in their system or has a medical problem that might mimic symptoms of drug addiction.""'In asking questions about mental health symptoms, specialists are often exploring if the person suffers from ''depression'' and/or ''manic'' symptoms but also ''anxiety'', ''hallucinations'', or ''delusions'', as well as some behavioral problems. Practitioners may provide the people they evaluate with a quiz or self-test as a screening tool for substance use disorders. Since some of the symptoms of chemical dependency can also occur in other mental illnesses, the screening is to determine if the individual suffers from ''bipolar disorder'', an ''anxiety disorder'', ''schizophrenia'', ''schizoaffective disorder'', and other ''psychotic disorders'', or a personality or behavior disorder like ''antisocial personality disorder'' or ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD''), respectively. Any condition that is associated with sudden changes in behavior, mood, or thinking, like ''bipolar disorder'', a psychotic disorder, ''borderline personality disorder'', or ''dissociative identity disorder'"" (DID), may be particularly challenging to separate from some symptoms of drug use disorder. In order to assess the person's current emotional state, health care providers perform a mental-status examination, as well.""'In addition to providing treatment that is appropriate to the diagnosis, determining the history or presence of mental illnesses that may co-occur (be co-morbid) with substance abuse or dependence is important in promoting the best possible outcome for the person. As previously described, the dual diagnosis of substance abusing or addicted individuals dictates the need for treatment that addresses both issues in a coordinated way by professionals who are trained and experienced with helping this specific population.' "
What is the treatment for drug addiction?,"'An unfortunate fact about the treatment of drug addiction is that it remains largely underutilized by most sufferers. Facts about the use of drug addiction treatment include that less than 10% of people with a milder substance-use disorder and less than 40% of those with a more entrenched substance-use disorder seek professional help. Those statistics do not seem to be associated with socioeconomic or other demographic traits but do seem to be associated with the presence of other mental health problems (co-morbidity).''The primary goals of drug-use disorder treatment (also called recovery) are abstinence, relapse prevention, and rehabilitation. During the initial stage of abstinence, an individual who suffers from chemical dependency may need help avoiding or decreasing the effects of withdrawal. That process is detoxification or ""detox."" Medical professionals primarily perform that part of drug addiction treatment in a hospital or other inpatient setting, where medications used to lessen withdrawal symptoms and close medical monitoring can be performed. The medications used for detox depend on the drug the person is dependent upon. For example, people with alcohol use disorder might receive medications like ''sedatives'' (''benzodiazepines'') or ''blood pressure'' medications to decrease ''palpitations'' and blood pressure, or ''seizure'' medications to prevent ''seizures'' during the detoxification process.''For many substances of abuse, the detox process is the most difficult part of dealing with the physical symptoms of addiction and tends to be short term, lasting days to a few weeks. Physicians sometimes use medications to help addicted individuals abstain from drug use on a long-term basis also depend on the specific drug of addiction. For example, individuals who are dependent on opioids like Percodan (a combination of ''aspirin'' and ''oxycodone'' hydrochloride) heroin, or Vicodin, Vicodin ES, ''Anexsia'', ''Lorcet'', Lorcet Plus, or Norco (combinations of ''hydrocodone and acetaminophen'') often benefit from receiving longer-acting, less addictive narcotic-like substances like methadone (''Methadose''). People with alcohol addiction might try to avoid alcohol intake by taking ''disulfiram'' (''Antabuse''), which produces ''nausea'', stomach cramping, and ''vomiting'' in reaction to the person consuming alcohol.''Often, much more difficult and time-consuming than recovery from the physical aspects of drug dependency is psychological addiction. For people who may have less severe drug use disorder, the symptoms of psychological addiction may be able to be managed in an outpatient treatment program. However, those who have a more severe addiction, have relapsed after participation in outpatient programs, or who also suffer from a severe mental health condition might need the elevated level of structure, support, and monitoring provided in an inpatient drug addiction treatment center, often called ""rehab."" Following such inpatient treatment, many people with this level of drug use disorder can benefit from living in a sober living community, that is, a group-home setting where counselors provide continued sobriety support, structure, and monitoring on a daily basis.''Self-help groups for people with a drug use disorder, like Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous or for loved ones of addicted individuals, like Al-Anon, are important to drug addiction recovery. Specifically, such groups provide an emotionally safe place for people with substance use disorders and their loved ones to share their feelings and experiences, as well as benefit from the experiences of others in their efforts to abstain from using drugs.'""Also important in the treatment of drug dependency is helping the parents, other family members, and friends of the addicted person refrain from supporting addictive behaviors (codependency). Whether providing financial support, making excuses, or failing to acknowledge the drug seeking and other maladaptive behaviors of the drug abuser, discouraging such codependency of loved ones is a key component of recovery. A focus on the addicted person's role in the family becomes perhaps even more significant when that person is a child or teenager, given that minors come within the context of a family in nearly every instance. Drug dependency treatment for children and adolescents is further different from that in adults by the impact of drugs on the developing brain, as well as the younger addict's tendency to need help completing their education and achieving higher education or job training compared to addicts who may have completed those parts of their lives before developing the addiction.""""The treatment options for dual diagnosis seems to be less effective when management of the person's mental disorder is separate from the care for his or her chemical dependency. More successful are integrated treatment approaches that include interventions for both disorders. The inclusion of assessment, intensive case management, motivational interventions, behavior interventions, family treatment, as well as services for housing, rehabilitation, and medication management improve such interventions.""  "
What are complications of drug addiction?,"'Drug addiction puts its sufferers at risk for potentially devastating social, occupational, and medical complications. Effects of chemical dependency on families include increased risk of ''domestic violence''. Individuals with drug use disorder are also much less likely to find and keep a job compared to people who are not drug addicted. Children of parents with a substance use disorder are at higher risk for impaired social, educational, and health functioning, as well as being at higher risk for using drugs themselves.''In addition to the many devastating social and occupational complications of drug addiction, there are many potential medical complications. From respiratory arrest associated with heroin or sedative overdose to ''heart attack'' or ''stroke'' caused by cocaine or amphetamine intoxication, death is a highly possible complication of a drug use disorder. People who are dependent on drugs are also vulnerable to developing persistent medical conditions. ''Liver'' or ''heart failure'' and ''pancreatitis'' associated with alcoholism and brain damage associated with alcoholism or inhalants are just two such examples.' "
What is the prognosis of drug use disorder?,"'If treated, the prognosis of alcoholism and other drug use disorder improves but is not without challenges. Episodes of remission (abstinence from drug use) and relapse characterize recovery from substance dependency.' "
Is it possible to prevent drug abuse and addiction?,"'A number of different prevention approaches are effective in decreasing the risk of drug use disorder. Lifestyle changes, like increased physical activity and using other ''stress''-reduction techniques, help prevent drug use disorder in teens. Programs that are more formal are also helpful. For example, the Raising Healthy Children program, which includes interventions for teachers, parents, and students, helps prevent drug addiction in elementary school children when the program goes on for 18 months or more. Designing research-based prevention programs to meet the specific needs of children by age and specific community strengths and challenges contributes to the success of those programs. The prevalence of easier access to technology led to the development of computer-based prevention programs. Such programs are very promising in how they compare to more traditional prevention programs, as well as how many more people can be reached through technology.' "

Drug allergy definition,"'Allergic'' reactions are the hyper-immune response of our immune system to foreign (antigenic) substances. When certain foreign substances are introduced to the body, the immune system is triggered. (The immune system protects us from substances that may harm the body.) A hyper-immune response may result in ''allergic reaction'' symptoms. Medications are foreign substances and some of their components may trigger the immune systems of some people.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of an allergy to drug (medication) allergy?,"""Drug allergic reactions are similar to allergic reactions resulting from food and other substances that we ingest. A person's genetic make-up helps determine what they are allergic to, and the severity of their ""'allergies''. Allergic reactions, including drug ''allergy'' reactions, can be mild, moderate or even deadly.''More serious reactions involve swelling of lips, tongue that can cause difficulty ''breathing'' (''anaphylaxis'') that can lead to death.''Other signs and symptoms of drug ''allergies'' include:''Drug ''allergies'' may occur at any time during drug treatment. This means that the allergic reaction may occur after the first exposure to the drug or when the drug is taken again in the future.''Allergic reactions are different from common side effects of many ''drugs'' such as a ''headache'' or ''upset stomach''.'

HIV medications  Dyes Egg proteins Peanuts Latex (in the packaging of drugs) "
Is there a test for drug (medication) allergies?,"'Most times drug allergies are identified based on the time proximity of the reaction to administration of the drug and patient history. If the drug is stopped and the symptoms also stop; then the logical conclusion is that the drug caused the allergic reaction. Skin testing can also be used to verify that the drug is causing the allergy. If it is a drug that the patient needs and there are no other alternatives, careful skin testing can be done to determine if the person is truly allergic to the drug. ' "
"What is the treatment for a drug 
(medication) allergy?","'The first step is to stop the drug you suspect is causing the signs and symptoms. ''In situations where a drug is needed and there are no alternatives an allergist can attempt to desensitize the individual by gradually giving very small amounts of the drug and increasing the amount over a time.'   For skin reactions such as rashes and
	itching antihistamine creams (for example 
	Benadryl) or steroid creams (for example, hydrocortisone) are used. 
	Oral antihistamines and steroids are used for more bothersome symptoms. 
	 Antihistamines injections and or steroids are given for serious allergic reactions. 
	 For life threatening anaphylactic reactions which involve difficulty breathing, epinephrine is given usually intramuscularly."

Is it safe to use medicine while I am pregnant?,"'There is no clear-cut answer to this question. Before you start or stop any medicine, it is always best to speak with the doctor who is caring for you while you are ''pregnant''. Read on to learn about deciding to use medicine while pregnant.' "
How should I decide whether to use a medicine while I am pregnant?,"'When deciding whether or not to use a medicine in ''pregnancy'"", you and your doctor need to talk about the medicine's benefits and risks.""'There may be times during pregnancy when using medicine is a choice. Some of the medicine choices you and your doctor make while you are pregnant may differ from the choices you make when you are not pregnant. For example, if you get a ''cold'', you may decide to ""live with"" your stuffy nose instead of using the ""stuffy nose"" medicine you use when you are not pregnant.''Other times, using medicine is not a choice - it is needed. Some women need to use medicines while they are pregnant. Sometimes, women need medicine for a few days or a couple of weeks to treat a problem like a''bladder infection'' or ''strep throat''. Other women need to use medicine every day to control long-term health problems like ''asthma'', ''diabetes'', ''depression'', or ''seizures''. Also, some women have a pregnancy problem that needs medicine treatment. These problems include severe''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', earlier pregnancy losses, or preterm ''labor''.'

	 Risks: what are the ways the medicine might harm me or my growing baby (fetus)?"
Where do doctors and nurses find out about using medicines during pregnancy?,"'Doctors and nurses get information from medicine labels and packages, textbooks, and research journals. They also share knowledge with other doctors and nurses and talk to the people who make and sell medicines.'""The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the part of our country's government that controls the medicines that can and can't be sold in the United States. The FDA lets a company sell a medicine in the United States if it is safe to use and works for a certain problem. Companies that make medicines usually have to show FDA doctors and scientists whether ""'birth defects'' or other problems occur in baby animals when the medicine is given to pregnant animals. Most of the time, ''drugs'' are not studied in pregnant women.''The FDA works with the drug companies to make clear and complete labels. But in most cases, there is not much information about how a medicine affects pregnant women and their growing ''babies''. Many prescription medicine labels include the results of studies done in pregnant animals. But a medicine does not always affect growing humans and animals in the same way. Here is an example:''A medicine is given to pregnant rats. If the medicine causes problems in some of the rat babies, it may or may not cause problems in human babies. If there are no problems in the rat babies, it does not prove that the medicine will not cause problems in human babies.The FDA asks for studies in two different kinds of animals. This improves the chance that the studies can predict what may happen in pregnant women and their babies.\t'""There is a lot that FDA doctors and scientists do not know about using medicine during pregnancy. In a perfect world, every medicine label would include helpful information about the medicine's effects on pregnant women and their growing babies. Unfortunately, this is not the case."" "
What are examples of prescription medications that are safe to use during pregnancy?,"'Doctors use information from many sources when they choose medicine for a patient, including medicine labels. To help doctors, the FDA created pregnancy letter categories to help explain what is known about using medicine during pregnancy. This system assigns letter categories to all prescription medicines. The letter category is listed in the label of a prescription medicine. The label states whether studies were done in pregnant women or pregnant animals and if so, what happened. ''Over-the-counter'' (OTC) medicines do not have a pregnancy letter category. Some OTC medicines were prescription medicines first and used to have a letter category. Talk to your doctor and follow the instructions on the label before taking OTC medicines.'""The FDA chooses a medicine's letter category based on what is known about the medicine when used in pregnant women and animals.""'The FDA is working hard to gather more knowledge about using medicine during pregnancy. The FDA is also trying to make medicine labels more helpful to doctors. Medicine label information for prescription medicines is now changing, and the pregnancy part of the label will change over the next few years.' "
What over-the-counter (OTC) medications are safe to use during pregnancy?,"'Keep in mind that other things like ''caffeine'', ''vitamins'', and herbal remedies can affect the growing fetus. Talk with your doctor about cutting down on ''caffeine'' and ask which type of vitamin you should take. Never use an herbal product without talking to your doctor first.''All OTC medicines have a Drug Facts label. The Drug Facts label is arranged the same way on all OTC medicines. This makes information about using the medicine easier to find. One section of the Drug Facts label is for pregnant women. With OTC medicines, the label usually tells a pregnant woman to speak with her doctor before using the medicine. Some OTC medicines are known to cause certain problems in pregnancy. The labels for these medicines give pregnant women facts about why and when they should not use the medicine. Here are some examples:''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') like ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil''®, ''Motrin''®), ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''®), and ''aspirin'' (acetylsalicylate), can cause serious blood flow problems in the baby if used during the last third of pregnancy (after 28 weeks). Also, aspirin may increase the chance for bleeding problems in the mother and the baby during pregnancy or at delivery.''The labels for ''nicotine'' therapy drugs, like the ''nicotine patch'' and lozenge, remind women that ''smoking'' can harm an unborn child. While the medicine is thought to be safer than ''smoking'', the risks of the medicine are not fully known. Pregnant ''smokers'' are told to try quitting without the medicine first.' "
What if I'm thinking about getting pregnant?,"'If you are not pregnant yet, you can help your chances for having a healthy baby by planning ahead. Schedule a pre-pregnancy checkup. At this visit, you can talk to your doctor about the medicines, ''vitamins'', and herbs you use. It is very important that you keep treating your health problems while you are pregnant. Your doctor can tell you if you need to switch your medicine. Ask about vitamins for women who are trying to get pregnant. All women who can get pregnant should take a daily vitamin with ''folic acid'' (a B vitamin) to prevent birth defects of the brain and spinal cord. You should begin taking these vitamins before you become pregnant or if you could become pregnant. It is also a good idea to discuss caffeine, ''alcohol'', and ''smoking'' with your doctor at this time.' "
Is it safe to use medicine while I am trying to become pregnant?,"'It is hard to know exactly when you will get pregnant. Once you do get pregnant, you may not know you are pregnant for 10 to 14 days or longer. Before you start trying to get pregnant, it is wise to schedule a meeting with your doctor to discuss medicines that you use daily or every now and then. Sometimes, medicines should be changed, and sometimes they can be stopped before a woman gets pregnant. Each woman is different. So you should discuss your medicines with your doctor rather than making medicine changes on your own.' Do not stop any prescribed medicines without first talking to your doctor.

Some health problems need treatment. Not using a medicine that you need could harm you and your baby. For example, a ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI'') that is not treated may become a ''kidney infection''. Kidney infections can cause preterm ''labor'' and low birth weight. An antibiotic is needed to get rid of a ''UTI''. Ask your doctor whether the benefits of taking a certain medicine outweigh the risks for you and your baby.' "
Should you stop taking medications during pregnancy if you have health problems?,"'If you are pregnant or thinking about ''becoming pregnant'', you should talk to your doctor about your medicines. Do not stop or change them on your own. This includes medicines for ''depression'', ''asthma'', ''diabetes'', ''seizures'' (''epilepsy''), and other health problems. Not using medicine that you need may be more harmful to you and your baby than using the medicine.''For women living with ''HIV'', the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends using ''zidovudine'' (AZT) during pregnancy. Studies show that ''HIV'' positive women who use AZT during pregnancy greatly lower the risk of passing ''HIV'' to their babies. If a diabetic woman does not use her medicine during pregnancy, she raises her risk for ''miscarriage'', ''stillbirth'', and some birth defects. If ''asthma'' and ''high blood pressure'' are not controlled during pregnancy, problems with the fetus may result.' "
Are vitamins safe for me while I am pregnant?,"'Regular ''multivitamins'' and ''prenatal vitamins'' are safe to take during pregnancy and can be helpful. Women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant should take a daily multivitamin or ''prenatal'' vitamin that contains at least 400 micrograms (µg) of folic acid. It is best to start taking these vitamins before you become pregnant or if you could become pregnant. Folic acid reduces the chance of a baby having a neural tube defect, like ''spina bifida'', where the spine or brain does not form the right way. See our information on Folic Acid. Iron can help prevent a low blood count (''anemia'""). It's important to take the vitamin dose prescribed by your doctor. Too many vitamins can harm your baby. For example, very high levels of ""'vitamin A'' have been linked with severe birth defects.''''Vaccines'' and Pregnancy''''''Vaccines'' protect your body against dangerous diseases. Some ''vaccines'' are not safe to receive during pregnancy. For some vaccines, the decision to give a ''vaccine'"" during pregnancy depends on a pregnant woman's own situation. Her doctor may consider these questions before giving a vaccine:""'The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that ''Hepatitis B'' vaccination should be considered when women are at risk for developing''Hepatitis B'' during pregnancy, and inactivated ''influenza'' vaccine  should be considered for women who are pregnant during ''flu'' season. On the other hand, a pregnant woman who is not immune to ''rubella'' (''German measles'') is not given a ''rubella'' vaccine until after pregnancy. Talk with your doctor to make sure you are fully protected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides ''vaccine guidelines for pregnant women''.'   Is there is a high chance she will be exposed to the disease?  Would the infection pose a risk to the mother or fetus?  Is the vaccine unlikely to cause harm? "
Are herbal remedies or natural products safe for me when I am pregnant?,"'Except for some vitamins, little is known about using ''dietary supplements'' while pregnant. Some herbal remedy labels claim they will help with pregnancy. But, most often there are no good studies to show if these claims are true or if the herb can cause harm to or your baby. Talk with your doctor before using any herbal product or dietary supplement. These products may contain things that could harm you or your growing baby during your pregnancy.''In the United States, there are different laws for medicines and for dietary ''supplements''. The part of the FDA that controls dietary ''supplements'' is the same part that controls foods sold in the United States. Only dietary supplements containing new dietary ingredients that were not marketed before October 15, 1994, submit safety information for review by the FDA. However, unlike medicines, herbal remedies and ""natural products"" are not approved by the FDA for safety or for what they say they will do. Most have not even been evaluated for their potential to cause harm to you or the growing fetus, let alone shown to be safe for use in pregnancy. Before a company can sell a medicine, the company must complete many studies and send the results to the FDA. Many scientists and doctors at the FDA check the study results. The FDA allows the medicine to be sold only if the studies show that the medicine works and is safe to use.' "
"In the future, will there be better ways to know if medicines are safe to use during pregnancy?","'At this time, drugs are rarely tested for safety in pregnant women for fear of harming the unborn baby. Until this changes, pregnancy exposure registries help doctors and researchers learn how medicines affect pregnant mothers and their growing baby. A pregnancy exposure registry is a study that enrolls pregnant women who are using a certain medicine. The women sign up for the study while pregnant and are followed for a certain length of time after the baby is born. Researchers compare babies with mothers who used the medicine while pregnant to babies with mothers who did not use the medicine. This type of study compares large groups of pregnant mothers and babies to look for medicine effects. A woman and her doctor can use registry results to make more informed choices about using medicine while pregnant.''If you are pregnant and are using a medicine or were using one when you got pregnant, check to see if there is a pregnancy exposure registry for that medicine. The Food and Drug Administration has a list of pregnancy exposure registries (http://www.fda.gov/womens/registries/default.htm) that pregnant women can join.' "

What is drug-induced liver disease?,"'Drug-induced ''liver'' diseases are diseases of the liver that are caused by physician-prescribed medications, ''over-the-counter'' medications, ''vitamins'', hormones, herbs, illicit (""recreational"") ''drugs'', and environmental toxins.'  "
What is the liver?,"'The liver is an organ that is located in the upper right hand side of the abdomen, mostly behind the rib cage. The liver of an adult normally weighs close to three pounds and has many functions.''When drugs injure the liver and disrupt its normal function, symptoms, signs, and abnormal blood tests of ''liver disease'' develop. Abnormalities of drug-induced liver diseases are similar to those of liver diseases caused by other agents such as ''viruses'' and immunologic diseases. For example, drug-induced ''hepatitis'' (inflammation of the liver cells) is similar to ''viral hepatitis''; they both can cause elevations in blood levels of aspartate amino transferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (enzymes that leak from the injured liver and into the blood) as well as ''anorexia'' (''loss of appetite''), ''fatigue'', and ''nausea''. Drug-induced ''cholestasis'' (interference with the flow of bile that is caused by injury to the bile ducts) can mimic the ''cholestasis'' of autoimmune ''liver disease'' (e.g., ''primary biliary cirrhosis'' or ''PBC'') and can lead to elevations in blood levels of bilirubin (causing ''jaundice''), ''alkaline phosphatase'' (an enzyme that is leaked from injured bile ducts), and ''itching''.' The liver produces and secretes bile into the intestine where the bile assists with the digestion of dietary fat. The liver helps purify the blood by changing potentially harmful chemicals into harmless ones. The sources of these chemicals can be outside the body (for example, medications or alcohol), or inside the body (for example, ammonia, which is produced from the break-down of proteins; or bilirubin, which is produced from the break-up of hemoglobin). The liver removes chemicals from the blood (usually changing them into harmless chemicals) and then either secretes them with the bile for elimination in the stool, or secretes them back into the blood where they then are removed by the kidneys and eliminated in the urine. The liver produces many important substances, especially proteins that are necessary for good health. For example, it produces proteins like albumin (a protein that carries other molecules through the blood stream), as well as the proteins that cause blood to clot properly."
What are the symptoms of liver disease?,"'Patients with mild liver disease may have few or no symptoms or signs. Patients with more serious disease develop symptoms and signs that may be nonspecific or specific. ''Nonspecific symptoms (symptoms that also can be seen in other disorders) include:''Symptoms and signs that are specific for liver disease include:''Severe, advanced liver disease with ''cirrhosis'' can produce symptoms and signs related to ''cirrhosis''; these symptoms include:' fatigue,  weakness,  vague abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.  yellowing of the skin (jaundice) due to the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood, itching associated with liver disease, and  easy bruising due to decreased production of blood clotting factors by the diseased liver.  fluid accumulation in the legs (edema) and abdomen (ascites, due to 
increased pressure in the vessels going into the liver), 
 mental confusion or coma (from hepatic encephalopathy due to increase in 
ammonia), 
 kidney failure, 
 vulnerability to bacterial infections, and 
 gastrointestinal bleeding, secondary to varices (enlarged blood vessels in 
the esophagus or stomach)."
How do drugs cause liver disease?,"""Drugs can cause liver disease in several ways. Some drugs are directly injurious to the liver; others are transformed by the liver into chemicals that can cause injury to the liver directly or indirectly. (This may seem strange in light of the liver's important role in transforming toxic chemicals into nontoxic chemicals, but it happens.) There are three types of liver toxicity; dose-dependent toxicity, idiosyncratic toxicity, and ""'drug allergy''.''Drugs that cause ''dose-dependent toxicity'' can cause liver disease in most people if enough of the drug is taken. The most important example of dose-dependent toxicity is ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') overdose (discussed later in this article.). ''Drugs that cause ''idiosyncratic toxicity'' cause disease in only those few patients who have ''inherited'' specific genes that control the chemical transformation of that specific drug, causing accumulation of the drug or products of their transformation (metabolites) that are injurious to the liver. These inherited idiosyncratic toxicities usually are rare, and depending on the drug, typically occur in less than 1 to10 per 100,000 patients who are taking that drug; however, with some drugs the prevalence of toxicity is much higher. Even though the risk of developing drug-induced idiosyncratic liver disease is low, idiosyncratic liver disease is the most common form of drug-induced liver disease because tens of millions of patients are using drugs, and many of them are using several drugs. ''Idiosyncratic drug toxicity is difficult to detect in early ''clinical trials'' that usually involve, at most, only a few thousand patients. Idiosyncratic toxicity will surface only after millions of patients begin to receive the drug after the drug is approved by the FDA.''Drug ''allergy'' also may cause liver disease, though it is uncommon. In drug ''allergy'"", the liver is injured by the inflammation that occurs when the body's immune system attacks the drugs with antibodies and immune cells."" "
What types of liver disease do drugs cause?,"'Drugs and chemicals can cause a wide spectrum of liver injury. These include:'   Mild elevations in blood levels of liver enzymes without symptoms or signs of liver disease  Hepatitis (inflammation of liver cells)  Necrosis (death of liver cells) that often is caused by more severe hepatitis Cholestasis (decreased secretion and/or flow of bile)  Steatosis (accumulation of fat in the liver)  Cirrhosis (advanced scarring of the liver) as a result of chronic hepatitis, cholestasis, or fatty liver Mixed disease, for example both hepatitis and necrosis of liver cells, hepatitis and fat accumulation, or cholestasis and hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis with severe, life threatening liver failure   Blood clots in the veins of the liver "
Elevated blood levels of liver enzymes,"'Many drugs cause mild elevations in blood levels of liver enzymes without symptoms or signs of hepatitis. AST, ALT, and ''alkaline phosphatase'' are enzymes that normally reside within the cells of the liver and bile ducts. Some drugs can cause these enzymes to leak from the cells and into the blood, thus elevating the blood levels of the enzymes. Examples of drugs that more commonly cause elevations of liver enzymes in the blood include the ''statins'' (used in treating high blood ''cholesterol levels'') some antibiotics, some ''antidepressants'' (used in treating ''depression''), and some medications used for treating ''diabetes'', ''tacrine'' (Cognex), ''aspirin'', and ''quinidine'' (Quinaglute, Quinidex).'""Since these patients typically experience no symptoms or signs, the elevations of liver enzymes usually are discovered when blood tests are performed as a part of an annual physical examination, as pre-operative screening, or as a part of periodic monitoring for drug toxicity. Typically, these abnormal levels will become normal shortly after stopping the drug, and there usually is no long-term liver damage. With some drugs, low levels of abnormal liver enzymes are common and don't appear to be associated with important (severe or progressive) liver disease, and the patient may continue taking the drug."" "
Acute and chronic hepatitis,"'Certain drugs can cause acute and chronic hepatitis (inflammation of liver cells) that can lead to necrosis (death) of the cells. Acute drug-induced hepatitis is defined as hepatitis that lasts less than 3 months, while chronic hepatitis lasts longer than 3 months. Acute drug-induced hepatitis is much more common than chronic drug-induced hepatitis.''Typical symptoms of drug-induced hepatitis include:''In more serious cases, patients can develop ''dark urine'', ''fever'', light-colored ''stool'', and jaundice (a yellow appearance to the skin and white portion of the eyes). Patients with hepatitis usually have high blood levels of AST, ALT, and bilirubin. Both acute and chronic hepatitis typically resolve after stopping the drug, but sometimes acute hepatitis can be severe enough to cause acute liver failure (see discussion later in this article), and chronic hepatitis can on rare occasions, lead to permanent liver damage and cirrhosis.''Examples of drugs that can cause ''acute hepatitis'' include acetaminophen (Tylenol), ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin''), aspirin, ''isoniazid'' (Nydrazid, Laniazid), ''diclofenac'' (''Voltaren''), and ''amoxicillin''/clavulanic acid (''Augmentin'').''Examples of drugs that can cause ''chronic hepatitis'' include ''minocycline'' (''Minocin''), ''nitrofurantoin'' (''Furadantin'', ''Macrodantin''), phenytoin (Dilantin), ''propylthiouracil'', ''fenofibrate'' (''Tricor''), and methamphetamine (""ecstasy"")..'   loss of appetite,  nausea,  vomiting, fever,  weakness,  tiredness, and  abdominal pain."
Acute liver failure,"'Rarely, drugs cause acute liver failure (fulminant hepatitis). These patients are extremely ill with the symptoms of acute hepatitis and the additional problems of confusion or ''coma'' (''encephalopathy'') and ''bruising'' or bleeding (coagulopathy). In fact, 40% to 70% of people with fulminant hepatitis die, depending upon the cause. In the U. S., acetaminophen (Tylenol) is the most common cause of acute liver failure.' "
Cholestasis,"""Cholestasis is a condition in which the secretion and/or flow of bile is reduced. Bilirubin and bile acids normally secreted by the liver into bile and eliminated from the body via the intestine, collect in the body leading to jaundice and itching, respectively. Drugs causing cholestasis typically interfere with the liver cell's secretion of bile without causing hepatitis or liver cell necrosis (death). Patients with drug-induced cholestasis typically have elevated blood levels of bilirubin but have normal or mildly elevated AST and ALT levels. Blood levels of alkaline phosphate (an enzyme made by bile ducts) increase because the cells of the bile ducts also are dysfunctional and leak the enzyme. Aside from itching and jaundice, patients usually are not as sick as patients with acute hepatitis.""'Examples of drugs that have been reported to cause cholestasis include ''erythromycin'' (E-Mycin, Ilosone), ''chlorpromazine'' (''Thorazine''), ''sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim'' (''Bactrim''; ''Septra''), ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil'', ''Endep''), ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol''), ''ampicillin'' (Omnipen; Polycillin; Principen), ampicillin/clavulanic acid (Augmentin), rifampin (''Rifadin''), ''estradiol'' (''Estrace''; ''Climara''; Estraderm; Menostar), ''captopril'' (''Capoten''), ''birth control pills'' (''oral contraceptives''), ''anabolic steroids'', ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn''), ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone''), ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol''), ''imipramine'' (''Tofranil''), ''tetracycline'' (Achromycin), and phenytoin (Dilantin).''Most patients with drug-induced cholestasis will recover fully within weeks after stopping the drug, but in some patients, jaundice, itching, and ''abnormal liver tests'' can last months after stopping the drug. An occasional patient can develop chronic liver disease and liver failure. Drug-induced jaundice and cholestasis lasting longer than 3 months is called chronic cholestasis.' "
Steatosis (fatty liver),"'The most common causes of accumulation of fat in the liver are ''alcoholism'' and non-alcoholic ''fatty liver disease'' (NAFLD) associated with ''obesity'' and ''diabetes''. Drugs may cause fatty liver with or without associated hepatitis. Patients with drug-induced fatty liver may have only a few symptoms, or none. They typically have mild to moderate elevations in blood levels of ALT and AST, and also may develop enlarged livers. In severe cases, drug-induced fatty liver can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure.''Drugs reported to cause fatty liver include total parenteral ''nutrition'', ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex''), ''griseofulvin'' (''Grifulvin V''), ''tamoxifen'' (''Nolvadex''), steroids, valproate (''Depakote''), and ''amiodarone'' (Cordarone).'""In certain situations, fatty liver alone can be life threatening. For example, Reye's syndrome is a rare liver disease that can cause fatty liver, liver failure, and coma. It is believed to occur in children and teenagers with ""'influenza'' when they are given aspirin. Another example of serious fatty liver is caused by high doses of intravenous tetracycline or amiodarone. Certain herbs (for example, the Chinese herb Jin Bu Huan, used as a sedative and ''pain reliever'') also can cause serious fatty liver.' "
Cirrhosis,"'Chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis, fatty liver, or cholestasis can lead to the necrosis (death) of liver cells. ''Scar tissue'' forms as part of the healing process that is associated with the dying liver cells, and severe scarring of the liver can lead to cirrhosis. ''The most common example of drug-induced cirrhosis is alcoholic cirrhosis         . Examples of drugs that can cause chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis include methotrexate (Rheumatrex), amiodarone (Cordarone), and ''methyldopa'' (''Aldomet''). Please read the article on Cirrhosis for more information.'  "
Hepatic vein thrombosis,"'Normally, blood from the ''intestines'' is delivered to the liver via the portal vein, and the blood leaving the liver for the ''heart'' is carried via the hepatic veins into the inferior vena cava (the large vein that drains into the heart). Certain drugs can cause blood clots to form (thrombosis) in the hepatic veins and in the inferior vena cava. Thrombosis of the hepatic vein and inferior vena cava can lead to an ''enlarged liver'', ''abdominal pain'', fluid collection in the abdomen (ascites), and liver failure. This syndrome is called the Budd Chiari syndrome. The most important drugs that cause Budd-Chiari syndrome are ''birth control pills'' (oral contraceptives). ''Birth control'' pills also can cause a related disease called veno-occlusive disease in which blood clots only in the smallest hepatic veins. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids found in certain herbs (e.g., borage, ''comfrey'') also can cause veno-occlusive disease. ' "
How is drug-induced liver disease diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of drug-induced liver diseases often is difficult. Patients may not have symptoms of liver disease or may have only mild, nonspecific symptoms. Patients may be taking multiple drugs, which makes it difficult to identify the offending drug. Patients also may have other potential causes of liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholism. '""The diagnosis of liver disease is based on a patient's symptoms (such as loss of appetite, nausea, ""'fatigue'', itching, and dark urine), findings on the physical examination (such as jaundice, enlarged liver), and abnormal laboratory tests (such as blood levels of liver enzymes or bilirubin and blood clotting times). If a patient has symptoms, signs, and abnormal ''liver tests'', doctors then try to decide whether drug(s) are causing the liver disease by:' Taking a careful history of alcohol consumption to exclude alcoholic liver disease.  Performing blood tests to exclude viral hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and to exclude chronic liver diseases such as autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Performing abdominal ultrasound or computerized tomography (CT) scan of the liver to exclude gallbladder disease and tumors of the liver. Taking a careful history of ingestion-particularly recent initiation--of drugs that are commonly associated with liver disease."
What is the treatment for drug-induced liver disease?,"'The most important treatment for drug-induced liver disease is stopping the drug that is causing the liver disease. In most patients, signs and symptoms of liver disease will resolve and blood tests will become normal and there will be no long-term liver damage. There are exceptions, however. For example, Tylenol overdoses are treated with oral N-acetylcysteine to prevent severe liver necrosis and failure. Liver transplantation may be necessary for some patients with acute liver failure. Some drugs also can cause irreversible liver damage and cirrhosis.'  "
What are some important examples of drug-induced liver disease?,"'An overdose of acetaminophen can damage the liver. The probability of damage as well as the severity of the damage depends on the dose of acetaminophen ingested; the higher the dose, the more likely it is that there will be damage and the more likely it is that the damage will be severe. (The reaction to acetaminophen is dose-dependent and predictable; it is not idiosyncratic - peculiar to the individual.) The liver injury from an overdose of acetaminophen is a serious matter since the damage can be severe and result in liver failure and death. In fact, acetaminophen overdose is the leading cause of acute (rapid onset) liver failure in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.'""For the average healthy adult, the recommended maximum dose of acetaminophen during a 24-hour period is 4 grams (4000 mg) or eight extra-strength tablets. (Each extra-strength tablet contains 500 mg, while each regular strength tablet contains 325 mg.) Among children, the dose of acetaminophen is determined on the basis of each child's weight and age, explicitly stated in the package insert. If these guidelines for adults and children are followed, acetaminophen is safe and carries essentially no risk of liver injury. A person who ""'drinks'' more than two alcoholic ''beverages'' per day, however, should not take more than 2 grams (2000 mg) of acetaminophen over 24 hours, as discussed below, since alcohol makes the liver susceptible to damage from lower doses of acetaminophen.'""A single dose of 7 to 10 grams (7000 - 10,000 mg) of acetaminophen (14 to 20 extra-strength tablets), twice the recommended dose, can cause liver injury in the average healthy adult. Among children, a single dose of 140 mg/kg (body weight) of acetaminophen can result in liver injury. Nevertheless, 3 to 4 grams ((3000 to 4000 mg) taken in a single dose or 4 to 6 grams (4000 to 6000 mg) over 24 hours have been reported to cause severe liver injury in some people, sometimes even resulting in death. It seems that certain individuals, for example, those who regularly drink alcohol, are more prone than others to developing acetaminophen-induced liver damage. Other factors that increase a person's risk for damage from acetaminophen include the fasting state, malnutrition, and concomitant administration of some other drugs such as phenytoin (Dilantin), phenobarbital, carbamazepine [(Tegretol) (anti-""'seizure'' medications)] or isoniazid [(Nydrazid, Laniazid) (anti-''TB'' drug)].''Please read the ''Tylenol Liver Damage'' article for a detailed discussion of the symptoms, mechanisms of acetaminophen toxicity, treatment (early use of N-acetylcysteine), and ''prevention''.''Statins are the most widely used medications to lower ""bad"" (LDL) ''cholesterol'' in order to prevent ''heart attacks'' and ''strokes''. Most doctors believe that statins are safe for long-term use, and important liver injury is rare. Nevertheless, statins can injure the liver. The most common liver-related problem caused by statins is mild elevations in blood levels of liver enzymes (ALT and AST) without symptoms. These abnormalities usually improve or completely resolve upon stopping the statin or reducing the dose. There is no permanent liver damage.''Patients with obesity have an increased chance of developing ''diabetes'', non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFALD), and elevated blood cholesterol levels. Patients with fatty liver often have no symptoms, and the abnormal tests are discovered when routine blood testing is done. Recent studies have found that statins can be used safely to treat high blood cholesterol in patients who already have fatty liver and mildly abnormal ''liver blood tests'' when the statin is started. In these patients, doctors may choose to use statins at lower doses and monitor liver enzyme levels regularly during treatment.''Nevertheless, idiosyncratic liver toxicity capable of causing severe liver damage (including liver failure leading to liver transplantation) has been reported with statins. The frequency of severe liver disease caused by satins is likely in the range of 1-2 per million users. As a precaution, the FDA labeling information advises that liver enzyme blood tests should be performed before and 12 weeks following the initiation of statin treatment or increase in dose, and periodically thereafter (for example, every six months).''Niacin'', like the statins, has been used to treat elevated blood cholesterol levels as well as elevated ''triglyceride levels''. Also like the statins, niacin can damage the liver. It can cause mild transient elevations in blood levels of AST and ALT, jaundice, and, in rare instances, liver failure. Liver toxicity with niacin is dose-dependent; toxic doses usually exceed 2 grams per day. Patients with pre-existing liver diseases and those who drink alcohol regularly are at higher risk for developing niacin toxicity. The sustained-release preparations of niacin also are more likely to cause liver toxicity than the immediate-release preparations.''Amiodarone (Cordarone) is an important medication that is used to treat irregular heart rhythms such as ''atrial fibrillation'' and ventricular tachycardia. Amiodarone can cause liver damage ranging from mild and reversible liver blood enzyme abnormalities, to acute liver failure and irreversible cirrhosis. Mild liver blood test abnormalities are common and typically resolve weeks to months after stopping the drug. Serious liver damage occurs in less than 1% of patients.''Amiodarone differs from most other drugs because a substantial amount of amiodarone is stored in the liver. The stored drug is capable of causing fatty liver, hepatitis, and, more importantly, it can continue to damage the liver long after the drug is stopped. Serious liver damage can lead to acute liver failure, cirrhosis, and the need for liver transplantation.''Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, ''Trexall'') has been used for the long-term treatment of patients with ''severe psoriasis'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''psoriatic arthritis'"", and some patients with Crohn's disease. Methotrexate has been found to be a cause of liver cirrhosis in a dose-dependent fashion. Patients with pre-existing liver diseases, ""'obese'' patients, and those who drink alcohol regularly are particularly at risk of developing methotrexate-induced cirrhosis. In recent years, doctors have substantially decreased methotrexate liver damage by using low doses of methotrexate (5-15 mg) given once a week and by carefully monitoring liver blood tests during therapy. Some doctors also perform liver biopsies on patients without liver symptoms after two years (or after a cumulative dose of 4 grams of methotrexate) to look for early liver cirrhosis.''Isoniazid (Nydrazid, Laniazid).'' Isoniazid has been used for decades to treat latent ''tuberculosis'' (patients with positive skin tests for ''tuberculosis'', without signs or symptoms of active tuberculosis). Most patients with isoniazid-induced liver disease only develop mild and reversible elevations in blood levels of AST and ALT without symptoms, but approximately 0.5% to 1% of the patients develop isoniazid-induced hepatitis. The risk of developing isoniazid hepatitis occurs more commonly in older patients than younger patients. The risk of serious liver disease is 0.5% in healthy young adults, and rises to more than 3% in patients older than 50. At least 10% of the patients who develop hepatitis go on to develop liver failure and require liver transplantation. The risk of isoniazid liver toxicity is increased with chronic regular alcohol intake, and with concomitant use of other medications such as Tylenol and rifampin (Rifadin, ''Rimactane'').''Early symptoms of isoniazid hepatitis are fatigue, poor appetite, nausea, and ''vomiting''. Jaundice may then follow. Most patients with isoniazid hepatitis recover fully and promptly after stopping the drug. Severe liver disease and liver failure mostly occur in patients who continue to take isoniazid after the onset of hepatitis. Therefore, the most important treatment for isoniazid liver toxicity is early recognition of hepatitis and discontinuation of the isoniazid before serious liver injury has occurred.''Nitrofurantoin. ''Nitrofurantoin is an anti-bacterial drug that is used to treat ''urinary tract infections'' caused by many gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria. (Nitrofurantoin was approved by the FDA in 1953.) There are three forms of nitrofurantoin available: a microcrystalline form (Furadantin), a macrocrystalline form (Macrodantin), and a sustained release, macrocrystalline form used twice daily (''Macrobid'').''Nitrofurantoin can cause acute and chronic liver disease. Most commonly, nitrofurantoin causes mild and reversible elevations in blood levels of liver enzymes without symptoms. In rare instances, nitrofurantoin can cause hepatitis.''Symptoms of nitrofurantoin hepatitis include:''Some patients with hepatitis also have a ''rash'', enlarged lymph glands, and nitrofurantoin-induced ''pneumonia'' (with symptoms of ''cough'' and ''shortness of breath''). Blood tests usually show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin. Recovery from hepatitis and other skin, joint, and lung symptoms is usually rapid once the drug is stopped. Serious liver disease such as acute liver failure and chronic hepatitis with cirrhosis mostly occur in patients who continue the drug despite developing hepatitis.''Augmentin.'' Augmentin is a combination of ''amoxicillin and clavulanic acid''. ''Amoxicillin'' is an antibiotic that is related to ''penicillin'' and ampicillin. It is effective against many bacteria such as ''H. influenzae, N. ''gonorrhea'', ''E. coli'', ''Pneumococci, Streptococci'', and certain ''strains'' of ''Staphylococci'', Addition of clavulanic acid to amoxicillin in Augmentin enhances the effectiveness of amoxicillin against many other bacteria that are ordinarily resistant to amoxicillin.''Augmentin has been reported to cause cholestasis with or without hepatitis. Augmentin-induced cholestasis is uncommon, but has been implicated in hundreds of cases of clinically apparent acute liver injury. Symptoms of cholestasis (jaundice, nausea, itching) usually occur 1-6 weeks after starting Augmentin, but the onset of liver disease can occur weeks after stopping the Augmentin. Most patients recover fully in weeks to months after stopping the medication, but rare cases of liver failure, cirrhosis, and liver transplantation have been reported.''Other antibiotics have been reported to cause liver disease. Some examples include minocycline (an antibiotic related to tetracycline), and Cotrimoxazole (a combination of ''sulfamethoxazole'' and ''trimethoprim'').''Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') are commonly prescribed for the bone and joint-related inflammation such as ''arthritis'', tendinitis and ''bursitis''. Examples of NSAIDs include aspirin, ''indomethacin'' (''Indocin''), ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin''), naproxen (Naprosyn), ''piroxicam'' (''Feldene''), and ''nabumetone'' (Relafen). Approximately 30 million Americans take NSAIDs regularly!''NSAIDs are safe when used properly and as prescribed by doctors; however, patients with cirrhosis and advanced liver disease should avoid NSAIDs since they can worsen ''liver function'' (and cause ''kidney failure'' as well).''Serious liver disease (such as hepatitis) from NSAIDs, occur rarely (in approximately 1-10 patients per 100,000 who use prescriptions). Diclofenac (Voltaren) is an example of an ''NSAID'' that has been reported to cause hepatitis slightly more frequently, in approximately 1-5 per 100,000 users of the drug. Hepatitis usually resolves completely after stopping the drug. Acute liver failure and chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis, have been reported rarely.''Tacrine (Cognex) is an oral medication used for treating '""Alzheimer's""' disease. (The FDA approved tacrine in 1993.) Tacrine has been reported to cause abnormal elevations in blood liver enzymes commonly. Patients may report nausea, but hepatitis and serious liver disease are rare. Abnormal tests usually become normal after tacrine is stopped.''Disulfiram'' (''Antabuse'') is a medication occasionally prescribed to treat alcoholism. It discourages drinking by causing nausea, vomiting, and other unpleasant physical reactions when alcohol is ingested. Disulfiram has been reported to cause acute hepatitis. In rare cases, disulfiram-induced hepatitis can lead to acute liver failure and liver transplantation.''Excess intake of ''vitamin A'', taken for years, can damage the liver. It is estimated that more than 30% of the U. S. population takes ''supplements'' of vitamin A, and some individuals are taking vitamin A at high doses that may be toxic to the liver (greater than 40,000 units/ day). Vitamin A-induced liver disease includes mild and reversible elevation in blood liver enzymes, hepatitis, chronic hepatitis with cirrhosis, and liver failure.''The symptoms of vitamin A toxicity may include bone and muscle aches, orange discoloration of skin, fatigue, and ''headache''. In advanced cases, patients will develop enlarged livers and spleens, jaundice, and ascites (abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdomen). Patients who drink alcohol heavily and have other preexisting liver disease are at increased risk of liver damage from vitamin A. Gradual improvement in the liver disease usually occurs after stopping vitamin A, but progressive liver damage and failure may occur in severe vitamin A toxicity with cirrhosis.''Liver toxicity also has been reported with herbal teas. Examples include Ma Huang, ''Kava'' Kava , pyrrolizidine alkaloids in Comfrey, germander, and chaparral leaf. Amanita phylloides is a liver-toxic chemical found in poisonous mushrooms. Consumption of a single poisonous mushroom can lead to acute liver failure and death.' fatigue, fever, muscle and joint aches, poor appetite, nausea, weight loss, vomiting, jaundice, and sometimes itching."
What is drug-induced liver disease?,"'Drug-induced ''liver'' diseases are diseases of the liver that are caused by physician-prescribed medications, ''over-the-counter'' medications, ''vitamins'', hormones, herbs, illicit (""recreational"") ''drugs'', and environmental toxins.'  "
What is the liver?,"'The liver is an organ that is located in the upper right hand side of the abdomen, mostly behind the rib cage. The liver of an adult normally weighs close to three pounds and has many functions.''When drugs injure the liver and disrupt its normal function, symptoms, signs, and abnormal blood tests of ''liver disease'' develop. Abnormalities of drug-induced liver diseases are similar to those of liver diseases caused by other agents such as ''viruses'' and immunologic diseases. For example, drug-induced ''hepatitis'' (inflammation of the liver cells) is similar to ''viral hepatitis''; they both can cause elevations in blood levels of aspartate amino transferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (enzymes that leak from the injured liver and into the blood) as well as ''anorexia'' (''loss of appetite''), ''fatigue'', and ''nausea''. Drug-induced ''cholestasis'' (interference with the flow of bile that is caused by injury to the bile ducts) can mimic the ''cholestasis'' of autoimmune ''liver disease'' (e.g., ''primary biliary cirrhosis'' or ''PBC'') and can lead to elevations in blood levels of bilirubin (causing ''jaundice''), ''alkaline phosphatase'' (an enzyme that is leaked from injured bile ducts), and ''itching''.' The liver produces and secretes bile into the intestine where the bile assists with the digestion of dietary fat. The liver helps purify the blood by changing potentially harmful chemicals into harmless ones. The sources of these chemicals can be outside the body (for example, medications or alcohol), or inside the body (for example, ammonia, which is produced from the break-down of proteins; or bilirubin, which is produced from the break-up of hemoglobin). The liver removes chemicals from the blood (usually changing them into harmless chemicals) and then either secretes them with the bile for elimination in the stool, or secretes them back into the blood where they then are removed by the kidneys and eliminated in the urine. The liver produces many important substances, especially proteins that are necessary for good health. For example, it produces proteins like albumin (a protein that carries other molecules through the blood stream), as well as the proteins that cause blood to clot properly."
What are the symptoms of liver disease?,"'Patients with mild liver disease may have few or no symptoms or signs. Patients with more serious disease develop symptoms and signs that may be nonspecific or specific. ''Nonspecific symptoms (symptoms that also can be seen in other disorders) include:''Symptoms and signs that are specific for liver disease include:''Severe, advanced liver disease with ''cirrhosis'' can produce symptoms and signs related to ''cirrhosis''; these symptoms include:' fatigue,  weakness,  vague abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.  yellowing of the skin (jaundice) due to the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood, itching associated with liver disease, and  easy bruising due to decreased production of blood clotting factors by the diseased liver.  fluid accumulation in the legs (edema) and abdomen (ascites, due to 
increased pressure in the vessels going into the liver), 
 mental confusion or coma (from hepatic encephalopathy due to increase in 
ammonia), 
 kidney failure, 
 vulnerability to bacterial infections, and 
 gastrointestinal bleeding, secondary to varices (enlarged blood vessels in 
the esophagus or stomach)."
How do drugs cause liver disease?,"""Drugs can cause liver disease in several ways. Some drugs are directly injurious to the liver; others are transformed by the liver into chemicals that can cause injury to the liver directly or indirectly. (This may seem strange in light of the liver's important role in transforming toxic chemicals into nontoxic chemicals, but it happens.) There are three types of liver toxicity; dose-dependent toxicity, idiosyncratic toxicity, and ""'drug allergy''.''Drugs that cause ''dose-dependent toxicity'' can cause liver disease in most people if enough of the drug is taken. The most important example of dose-dependent toxicity is ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') overdose (discussed later in this article.). ''Drugs that cause ''idiosyncratic toxicity'' cause disease in only those few patients who have ''inherited'' specific genes that control the chemical transformation of that specific drug, causing accumulation of the drug or products of their transformation (metabolites) that are injurious to the liver. These inherited idiosyncratic toxicities usually are rare, and depending on the drug, typically occur in less than 1 to10 per 100,000 patients who are taking that drug; however, with some drugs the prevalence of toxicity is much higher. Even though the risk of developing drug-induced idiosyncratic liver disease is low, idiosyncratic liver disease is the most common form of drug-induced liver disease because tens of millions of patients are using drugs, and many of them are using several drugs. ''Idiosyncratic drug toxicity is difficult to detect in early ''clinical trials'' that usually involve, at most, only a few thousand patients. Idiosyncratic toxicity will surface only after millions of patients begin to receive the drug after the drug is approved by the FDA.''Drug ''allergy'' also may cause liver disease, though it is uncommon. In drug ''allergy'"", the liver is injured by the inflammation that occurs when the body's immune system attacks the drugs with antibodies and immune cells."" "
What types of liver disease do drugs cause?,"'Drugs and chemicals can cause a wide spectrum of liver injury. These include:'   Mild elevations in blood levels of liver enzymes without symptoms or signs of liver disease  Hepatitis (inflammation of liver cells)  Necrosis (death of liver cells) that often is caused by more severe hepatitis Cholestasis (decreased secretion and/or flow of bile)  Steatosis (accumulation of fat in the liver)  Cirrhosis (advanced scarring of the liver) as a result of chronic hepatitis, cholestasis, or fatty liver Mixed disease, for example both hepatitis and necrosis of liver cells, hepatitis and fat accumulation, or cholestasis and hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis with severe, life threatening liver failure   Blood clots in the veins of the liver "
Elevated blood levels of liver enzymes,"'Many drugs cause mild elevations in blood levels of liver enzymes without symptoms or signs of hepatitis. AST, ALT, and ''alkaline phosphatase'' are enzymes that normally reside within the cells of the liver and bile ducts. Some drugs can cause these enzymes to leak from the cells and into the blood, thus elevating the blood levels of the enzymes. Examples of drugs that more commonly cause elevations of liver enzymes in the blood include the ''statins'' (used in treating high blood ''cholesterol levels'') some antibiotics, some ''antidepressants'' (used in treating ''depression''), and some medications used for treating ''diabetes'', ''tacrine'' (Cognex), ''aspirin'', and ''quinidine'' (Quinaglute, Quinidex).'""Since these patients typically experience no symptoms or signs, the elevations of liver enzymes usually are discovered when blood tests are performed as a part of an annual physical examination, as pre-operative screening, or as a part of periodic monitoring for drug toxicity. Typically, these abnormal levels will become normal shortly after stopping the drug, and there usually is no long-term liver damage. With some drugs, low levels of abnormal liver enzymes are common and don't appear to be associated with important (severe or progressive) liver disease, and the patient may continue taking the drug."" "
Acute and chronic hepatitis,"'Certain drugs can cause acute and chronic hepatitis (inflammation of liver cells) that can lead to necrosis (death) of the cells. Acute drug-induced hepatitis is defined as hepatitis that lasts less than 3 months, while chronic hepatitis lasts longer than 3 months. Acute drug-induced hepatitis is much more common than chronic drug-induced hepatitis.''Typical symptoms of drug-induced hepatitis include:''In more serious cases, patients can develop ''dark urine'', ''fever'', light-colored ''stool'', and jaundice (a yellow appearance to the skin and white portion of the eyes). Patients with hepatitis usually have high blood levels of AST, ALT, and bilirubin. Both acute and chronic hepatitis typically resolve after stopping the drug, but sometimes acute hepatitis can be severe enough to cause acute liver failure (see discussion later in this article), and chronic hepatitis can on rare occasions, lead to permanent liver damage and cirrhosis.''Examples of drugs that can cause ''acute hepatitis'' include acetaminophen (Tylenol), ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin''), aspirin, ''isoniazid'' (Nydrazid, Laniazid), ''diclofenac'' (''Voltaren''), and ''amoxicillin''/clavulanic acid (''Augmentin'').''Examples of drugs that can cause ''chronic hepatitis'' include ''minocycline'' (''Minocin''), ''nitrofurantoin'' (''Furadantin'', ''Macrodantin''), phenytoin (Dilantin), ''propylthiouracil'', ''fenofibrate'' (''Tricor''), and methamphetamine (""ecstasy"")..'   loss of appetite,  nausea,  vomiting, fever,  weakness,  tiredness, and  abdominal pain."
Acute liver failure,"'Rarely, drugs cause acute liver failure (fulminant hepatitis). These patients are extremely ill with the symptoms of acute hepatitis and the additional problems of confusion or ''coma'' (''encephalopathy'') and ''bruising'' or bleeding (coagulopathy). In fact, 40% to 70% of people with fulminant hepatitis die, depending upon the cause. In the U. S., acetaminophen (Tylenol) is the most common cause of acute liver failure.' "
Cholestasis,"""Cholestasis is a condition in which the secretion and/or flow of bile is reduced. Bilirubin and bile acids normally secreted by the liver into bile and eliminated from the body via the intestine, collect in the body leading to jaundice and itching, respectively. Drugs causing cholestasis typically interfere with the liver cell's secretion of bile without causing hepatitis or liver cell necrosis (death). Patients with drug-induced cholestasis typically have elevated blood levels of bilirubin but have normal or mildly elevated AST and ALT levels. Blood levels of alkaline phosphate (an enzyme made by bile ducts) increase because the cells of the bile ducts also are dysfunctional and leak the enzyme. Aside from itching and jaundice, patients usually are not as sick as patients with acute hepatitis.""'Examples of drugs that have been reported to cause cholestasis include ''erythromycin'' (E-Mycin, Ilosone), ''chlorpromazine'' (''Thorazine''), ''sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim'' (''Bactrim''; ''Septra''), ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil'', ''Endep''), ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol''), ''ampicillin'' (Omnipen; Polycillin; Principen), ampicillin/clavulanic acid (Augmentin), rifampin (''Rifadin''), ''estradiol'' (''Estrace''; ''Climara''; Estraderm; Menostar), ''captopril'' (''Capoten''), ''birth control pills'' (''oral contraceptives''), ''anabolic steroids'', ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn''), ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone''), ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol''), ''imipramine'' (''Tofranil''), ''tetracycline'' (Achromycin), and phenytoin (Dilantin).''Most patients with drug-induced cholestasis will recover fully within weeks after stopping the drug, but in some patients, jaundice, itching, and ''abnormal liver tests'' can last months after stopping the drug. An occasional patient can develop chronic liver disease and liver failure. Drug-induced jaundice and cholestasis lasting longer than 3 months is called chronic cholestasis.' "
Steatosis (fatty liver),"'The most common causes of accumulation of fat in the liver are ''alcoholism'' and non-alcoholic ''fatty liver disease'' (NAFLD) associated with ''obesity'' and ''diabetes''. Drugs may cause fatty liver with or without associated hepatitis. Patients with drug-induced fatty liver may have only a few symptoms, or none. They typically have mild to moderate elevations in blood levels of ALT and AST, and also may develop enlarged livers. In severe cases, drug-induced fatty liver can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure.''Drugs reported to cause fatty liver include total parenteral ''nutrition'', ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex''), ''griseofulvin'' (''Grifulvin V''), ''tamoxifen'' (''Nolvadex''), steroids, valproate (''Depakote''), and ''amiodarone'' (Cordarone).'""In certain situations, fatty liver alone can be life threatening. For example, Reye's syndrome is a rare liver disease that can cause fatty liver, liver failure, and coma. It is believed to occur in children and teenagers with ""'influenza'' when they are given aspirin. Another example of serious fatty liver is caused by high doses of intravenous tetracycline or amiodarone. Certain herbs (for example, the Chinese herb Jin Bu Huan, used as a sedative and ''pain reliever'') also can cause serious fatty liver.' "
Cirrhosis,"'Chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis, fatty liver, or cholestasis can lead to the necrosis (death) of liver cells. ''Scar tissue'' forms as part of the healing process that is associated with the dying liver cells, and severe scarring of the liver can lead to cirrhosis. ''The most common example of drug-induced cirrhosis is alcoholic cirrhosis         . Examples of drugs that can cause chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis include methotrexate (Rheumatrex), amiodarone (Cordarone), and ''methyldopa'' (''Aldomet''). Please read the article on Cirrhosis for more information.'  "
Hepatic vein thrombosis,"'Normally, blood from the ''intestines'' is delivered to the liver via the portal vein, and the blood leaving the liver for the ''heart'' is carried via the hepatic veins into the inferior vena cava (the large vein that drains into the heart). Certain drugs can cause blood clots to form (thrombosis) in the hepatic veins and in the inferior vena cava. Thrombosis of the hepatic vein and inferior vena cava can lead to an ''enlarged liver'', ''abdominal pain'', fluid collection in the abdomen (ascites), and liver failure. This syndrome is called the Budd Chiari syndrome. The most important drugs that cause Budd-Chiari syndrome are ''birth control pills'' (oral contraceptives). ''Birth control'' pills also can cause a related disease called veno-occlusive disease in which blood clots only in the smallest hepatic veins. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids found in certain herbs (e.g., borage, ''comfrey'') also can cause veno-occlusive disease. ' "
How is drug-induced liver disease diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of drug-induced liver diseases often is difficult. Patients may not have symptoms of liver disease or may have only mild, nonspecific symptoms. Patients may be taking multiple drugs, which makes it difficult to identify the offending drug. Patients also may have other potential causes of liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholism. '""The diagnosis of liver disease is based on a patient's symptoms (such as loss of appetite, nausea, ""'fatigue'', itching, and dark urine), findings on the physical examination (such as jaundice, enlarged liver), and abnormal laboratory tests (such as blood levels of liver enzymes or bilirubin and blood clotting times). If a patient has symptoms, signs, and abnormal ''liver tests'', doctors then try to decide whether drug(s) are causing the liver disease by:' Taking a careful history of alcohol consumption to exclude alcoholic liver disease.  Performing blood tests to exclude viral hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and to exclude chronic liver diseases such as autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Performing abdominal ultrasound or computerized tomography (CT) scan of the liver to exclude gallbladder disease and tumors of the liver. Taking a careful history of ingestion-particularly recent initiation--of drugs that are commonly associated with liver disease."
What is the treatment for drug-induced liver disease?,"'The most important treatment for drug-induced liver disease is stopping the drug that is causing the liver disease. In most patients, signs and symptoms of liver disease will resolve and blood tests will become normal and there will be no long-term liver damage. There are exceptions, however. For example, Tylenol overdoses are treated with oral N-acetylcysteine to prevent severe liver necrosis and failure. Liver transplantation may be necessary for some patients with acute liver failure. Some drugs also can cause irreversible liver damage and cirrhosis.'  "
What are some important examples of drug-induced liver disease?,"'An overdose of acetaminophen can damage the liver. The probability of damage as well as the severity of the damage depends on the dose of acetaminophen ingested; the higher the dose, the more likely it is that there will be damage and the more likely it is that the damage will be severe. (The reaction to acetaminophen is dose-dependent and predictable; it is not idiosyncratic - peculiar to the individual.) The liver injury from an overdose of acetaminophen is a serious matter since the damage can be severe and result in liver failure and death. In fact, acetaminophen overdose is the leading cause of acute (rapid onset) liver failure in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.'""For the average healthy adult, the recommended maximum dose of acetaminophen during a 24-hour period is 4 grams (4000 mg) or eight extra-strength tablets. (Each extra-strength tablet contains 500 mg, while each regular strength tablet contains 325 mg.) Among children, the dose of acetaminophen is determined on the basis of each child's weight and age, explicitly stated in the package insert. If these guidelines for adults and children are followed, acetaminophen is safe and carries essentially no risk of liver injury. A person who ""'drinks'' more than two alcoholic ''beverages'' per day, however, should not take more than 2 grams (2000 mg) of acetaminophen over 24 hours, as discussed below, since alcohol makes the liver susceptible to damage from lower doses of acetaminophen.'""A single dose of 7 to 10 grams (7000 - 10,000 mg) of acetaminophen (14 to 20 extra-strength tablets), twice the recommended dose, can cause liver injury in the average healthy adult. Among children, a single dose of 140 mg/kg (body weight) of acetaminophen can result in liver injury. Nevertheless, 3 to 4 grams ((3000 to 4000 mg) taken in a single dose or 4 to 6 grams (4000 to 6000 mg) over 24 hours have been reported to cause severe liver injury in some people, sometimes even resulting in death. It seems that certain individuals, for example, those who regularly drink alcohol, are more prone than others to developing acetaminophen-induced liver damage. Other factors that increase a person's risk for damage from acetaminophen include the fasting state, malnutrition, and concomitant administration of some other drugs such as phenytoin (Dilantin), phenobarbital, carbamazepine [(Tegretol) (anti-""'seizure'' medications)] or isoniazid [(Nydrazid, Laniazid) (anti-''TB'' drug)].''Please read the ''Tylenol Liver Damage'' article for a detailed discussion of the symptoms, mechanisms of acetaminophen toxicity, treatment (early use of N-acetylcysteine), and ''prevention''.''Statins are the most widely used medications to lower ""bad"" (LDL) ''cholesterol'' in order to prevent ''heart attacks'' and ''strokes''. Most doctors believe that statins are safe for long-term use, and important liver injury is rare. Nevertheless, statins can injure the liver. The most common liver-related problem caused by statins is mild elevations in blood levels of liver enzymes (ALT and AST) without symptoms. These abnormalities usually improve or completely resolve upon stopping the statin or reducing the dose. There is no permanent liver damage.''Patients with obesity have an increased chance of developing ''diabetes'', non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFALD), and elevated blood cholesterol levels. Patients with fatty liver often have no symptoms, and the abnormal tests are discovered when routine blood testing is done. Recent studies have found that statins can be used safely to treat high blood cholesterol in patients who already have fatty liver and mildly abnormal ''liver blood tests'' when the statin is started. In these patients, doctors may choose to use statins at lower doses and monitor liver enzyme levels regularly during treatment.''Nevertheless, idiosyncratic liver toxicity capable of causing severe liver damage (including liver failure leading to liver transplantation) has been reported with statins. The frequency of severe liver disease caused by satins is likely in the range of 1-2 per million users. As a precaution, the FDA labeling information advises that liver enzyme blood tests should be performed before and 12 weeks following the initiation of statin treatment or increase in dose, and periodically thereafter (for example, every six months).''Niacin'', like the statins, has been used to treat elevated blood cholesterol levels as well as elevated ''triglyceride levels''. Also like the statins, niacin can damage the liver. It can cause mild transient elevations in blood levels of AST and ALT, jaundice, and, in rare instances, liver failure. Liver toxicity with niacin is dose-dependent; toxic doses usually exceed 2 grams per day. Patients with pre-existing liver diseases and those who drink alcohol regularly are at higher risk for developing niacin toxicity. The sustained-release preparations of niacin also are more likely to cause liver toxicity than the immediate-release preparations.''Amiodarone (Cordarone) is an important medication that is used to treat irregular heart rhythms such as ''atrial fibrillation'' and ventricular tachycardia. Amiodarone can cause liver damage ranging from mild and reversible liver blood enzyme abnormalities, to acute liver failure and irreversible cirrhosis. Mild liver blood test abnormalities are common and typically resolve weeks to months after stopping the drug. Serious liver damage occurs in less than 1% of patients.''Amiodarone differs from most other drugs because a substantial amount of amiodarone is stored in the liver. The stored drug is capable of causing fatty liver, hepatitis, and, more importantly, it can continue to damage the liver long after the drug is stopped. Serious liver damage can lead to acute liver failure, cirrhosis, and the need for liver transplantation.''Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, ''Trexall'') has been used for the long-term treatment of patients with ''severe psoriasis'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''psoriatic arthritis'"", and some patients with Crohn's disease. Methotrexate has been found to be a cause of liver cirrhosis in a dose-dependent fashion. Patients with pre-existing liver diseases, ""'obese'' patients, and those who drink alcohol regularly are particularly at risk of developing methotrexate-induced cirrhosis. In recent years, doctors have substantially decreased methotrexate liver damage by using low doses of methotrexate (5-15 mg) given once a week and by carefully monitoring liver blood tests during therapy. Some doctors also perform liver biopsies on patients without liver symptoms after two years (or after a cumulative dose of 4 grams of methotrexate) to look for early liver cirrhosis.''Isoniazid (Nydrazid, Laniazid).'' Isoniazid has been used for decades to treat latent ''tuberculosis'' (patients with positive skin tests for ''tuberculosis'', without signs or symptoms of active tuberculosis). Most patients with isoniazid-induced liver disease only develop mild and reversible elevations in blood levels of AST and ALT without symptoms, but approximately 0.5% to 1% of the patients develop isoniazid-induced hepatitis. The risk of developing isoniazid hepatitis occurs more commonly in older patients than younger patients. The risk of serious liver disease is 0.5% in healthy young adults, and rises to more than 3% in patients older than 50. At least 10% of the patients who develop hepatitis go on to develop liver failure and require liver transplantation. The risk of isoniazid liver toxicity is increased with chronic regular alcohol intake, and with concomitant use of other medications such as Tylenol and rifampin (Rifadin, ''Rimactane'').''Early symptoms of isoniazid hepatitis are fatigue, poor appetite, nausea, and ''vomiting''. Jaundice may then follow. Most patients with isoniazid hepatitis recover fully and promptly after stopping the drug. Severe liver disease and liver failure mostly occur in patients who continue to take isoniazid after the onset of hepatitis. Therefore, the most important treatment for isoniazid liver toxicity is early recognition of hepatitis and discontinuation of the isoniazid before serious liver injury has occurred.''Nitrofurantoin. ''Nitrofurantoin is an anti-bacterial drug that is used to treat ''urinary tract infections'' caused by many gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria. (Nitrofurantoin was approved by the FDA in 1953.) There are three forms of nitrofurantoin available: a microcrystalline form (Furadantin), a macrocrystalline form (Macrodantin), and a sustained release, macrocrystalline form used twice daily (''Macrobid'').''Nitrofurantoin can cause acute and chronic liver disease. Most commonly, nitrofurantoin causes mild and reversible elevations in blood levels of liver enzymes without symptoms. In rare instances, nitrofurantoin can cause hepatitis.''Symptoms of nitrofurantoin hepatitis include:''Some patients with hepatitis also have a ''rash'', enlarged lymph glands, and nitrofurantoin-induced ''pneumonia'' (with symptoms of ''cough'' and ''shortness of breath''). Blood tests usually show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin. Recovery from hepatitis and other skin, joint, and lung symptoms is usually rapid once the drug is stopped. Serious liver disease such as acute liver failure and chronic hepatitis with cirrhosis mostly occur in patients who continue the drug despite developing hepatitis.''Augmentin.'' Augmentin is a combination of ''amoxicillin and clavulanic acid''. ''Amoxicillin'' is an antibiotic that is related to ''penicillin'' and ampicillin. It is effective against many bacteria such as ''H. influenzae, N. ''gonorrhea'', ''E. coli'', ''Pneumococci, Streptococci'', and certain ''strains'' of ''Staphylococci'', Addition of clavulanic acid to amoxicillin in Augmentin enhances the effectiveness of amoxicillin against many other bacteria that are ordinarily resistant to amoxicillin.''Augmentin has been reported to cause cholestasis with or without hepatitis. Augmentin-induced cholestasis is uncommon, but has been implicated in hundreds of cases of clinically apparent acute liver injury. Symptoms of cholestasis (jaundice, nausea, itching) usually occur 1-6 weeks after starting Augmentin, but the onset of liver disease can occur weeks after stopping the Augmentin. Most patients recover fully in weeks to months after stopping the medication, but rare cases of liver failure, cirrhosis, and liver transplantation have been reported.''Other antibiotics have been reported to cause liver disease. Some examples include minocycline (an antibiotic related to tetracycline), and Cotrimoxazole (a combination of ''sulfamethoxazole'' and ''trimethoprim'').''Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') are commonly prescribed for the bone and joint-related inflammation such as ''arthritis'', tendinitis and ''bursitis''. Examples of NSAIDs include aspirin, ''indomethacin'' (''Indocin''), ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin''), naproxen (Naprosyn), ''piroxicam'' (''Feldene''), and ''nabumetone'' (Relafen). Approximately 30 million Americans take NSAIDs regularly!''NSAIDs are safe when used properly and as prescribed by doctors; however, patients with cirrhosis and advanced liver disease should avoid NSAIDs since they can worsen ''liver function'' (and cause ''kidney failure'' as well).''Serious liver disease (such as hepatitis) from NSAIDs, occur rarely (in approximately 1-10 patients per 100,000 who use prescriptions). Diclofenac (Voltaren) is an example of an ''NSAID'' that has been reported to cause hepatitis slightly more frequently, in approximately 1-5 per 100,000 users of the drug. Hepatitis usually resolves completely after stopping the drug. Acute liver failure and chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis, have been reported rarely.''Tacrine (Cognex) is an oral medication used for treating '""Alzheimer's""' disease. (The FDA approved tacrine in 1993.) Tacrine has been reported to cause abnormal elevations in blood liver enzymes commonly. Patients may report nausea, but hepatitis and serious liver disease are rare. Abnormal tests usually become normal after tacrine is stopped.''Disulfiram'' (''Antabuse'') is a medication occasionally prescribed to treat alcoholism. It discourages drinking by causing nausea, vomiting, and other unpleasant physical reactions when alcohol is ingested. Disulfiram has been reported to cause acute hepatitis. In rare cases, disulfiram-induced hepatitis can lead to acute liver failure and liver transplantation.''Excess intake of ''vitamin A'', taken for years, can damage the liver. It is estimated that more than 30% of the U. S. population takes ''supplements'' of vitamin A, and some individuals are taking vitamin A at high doses that may be toxic to the liver (greater than 40,000 units/ day). Vitamin A-induced liver disease includes mild and reversible elevation in blood liver enzymes, hepatitis, chronic hepatitis with cirrhosis, and liver failure.''The symptoms of vitamin A toxicity may include bone and muscle aches, orange discoloration of skin, fatigue, and ''headache''. In advanced cases, patients will develop enlarged livers and spleens, jaundice, and ascites (abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdomen). Patients who drink alcohol heavily and have other preexisting liver disease are at increased risk of liver damage from vitamin A. Gradual improvement in the liver disease usually occurs after stopping vitamin A, but progressive liver damage and failure may occur in severe vitamin A toxicity with cirrhosis.''Liver toxicity also has been reported with herbal teas. Examples include Ma Huang, ''Kava'' Kava , pyrrolizidine alkaloids in Comfrey, germander, and chaparral leaf. Amanita phylloides is a liver-toxic chemical found in poisonous mushrooms. Consumption of a single poisonous mushroom can lead to acute liver failure and death.' fatigue, fever, muscle and joint aches, poor appetite, nausea, weight loss, vomiting, jaundice, and sometimes itching."
Introduction,'You have been informed by your healthcare provider that you will need to receive intravenous (IV) infusions of a medication to treat your health condition. ''The treatment for many conditions relies on medications administered by IV infusion therapy.' 
How do I prepare for the infusion?,"'Below are a few helpful suggestions to help you create a pleasant and healing experience. ''Check with your healthcare practitioner or the staff at the infusion center for any pre-infusion instructions. Some examples may include: '   The first and most important step is to replace confusion with confidence.  Make a list of questions that pertain to your health condition or questions about your medication and infusion to review with your healthcare practitioner. It may be necessary to make an appointment to review all of your questions.  Learn about the infused medication. There are many places to obtain information about your medication. Discuss the medication(s) with your doctor. Pharmaceutical companies often provide information in the offices and on the Internet for patients and their families. There may also be medical books written about your medication or health condition.  Visit the Infusion Center and meet the medical staff before your first infusion.  Drink plenty of water to be sure you are well hydrated. If you have a heart condition, kidney condition or any other health condition that prevents you from drinking large amounts of fluid, check with your healthcare practitioner for instructions on how to hydrate before your infusion procedure. Some infusions may require that you pre-medicate with medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Check with the infusion staff regarding any pre-medications you need to take prior to your infusion, the dose, and the best time to take the medications.  Wear comfortable loose fitting clothes. You will want to be comfortable, and most likely your vital signs will monitored (for example, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate (breathing rate), or a cardiac monitor may be attached to your chest). Every infusion center is different, so check with yours in regard to what to expect. Wearing loose fitting clothes allows the medical staff to easily and properly monitor your vital signs.  Consider wearing clothing with layers to allow for temperature control. The temperature of the infusion center may be cool or warm; also some intravenous infusions can make you feel either warm or cool. Having layers of clothing allows you the flexibility to easily control your comfort zone.  Most infusion centers will provide blankets, pillows, water and coffee. Check to see what the center provides in case they do not offer something that will make you more comfortable.  Do not wear any fragrance or perfume, other patients may be allergic. Bring a complete list of current medications, allergies, and emergency contact information for the infusion staff to add to your chart."
What are some things I can do to pass the time while receiving therapy?,"'Things to take or do:''PLEASE DO NOT TALK ON YOUR CELL PHONE'' - Place your phone on vibrate mode or turn it off. This is not a time for talking on the phone (unless you have an OK from the infusion staff).''Arrive at the infusion center with a:'  Book Magazine Newspaper Crossword puzzle or Suduko game Hand held games - (if they are quiet or have headphones) Bring your own music (I-pod or MP3 player) A neck pillow - the type used on airplanes Pictures of your family or loved ones Study for that upcoming test Bring your computer and get some work done, watch a movie, or play games. Snacks and a drink (if allowed in the infusion room) Bring paper and pen - make a list of things you need to do Write a letter -a letter of encouragement - of love - of thanks. Catch up on paper work Plan a party Make your shopping list Knit Crochet Draw or doodle Plan a trip Take a nap Pray Meditate Smile Positive attitude (you are in good hands). Personal affirmation - Find one that feels good and energizes you. For example: ""I have the perfect medicine...at the perfect time...I am healing."" Sit back and relax"
What happens during and after the infusion?,"'Be confident that you are receiving excellent care!' Ask questions and notify the staff immediately if you are not feeling ""right"" or have a concern.  Consider talking with someone in the Infusion Center receiving treatment. They may have some advice about their health condition that will help you. You may meet a new friend.  After your infusion is completed, ask for any important post infusion instructions. You may need to take post-infusion medications. Check with your healthcare practitioner or the infusion staff for detailed instructions.  A dressing will be placed in the area where your infusion was done. This dressing should be kept in place for at least 30 minutes or longer. If you are on a blood thinner, leave the dressing in place longer to avoid any bleeding. Check with the staff at the Infusion Center in regard to the length of time necessary to keep the dressing in place.  If you have an allergy to tape, inform the infusion staff (advise them of all allergies).  Obtain a phone number to call in the event that you have any questions or possible side effects to the medication you receive (such as a fever or rash) after your infusion has been completed. "
What are some of the conditions that are treated with an IV drug infusion?,'Examples of conditions treated with IV infusion include:'   Ankylosing spondylitis  Behcet's disease  Cancer Common variable immunodeficiency Crohn's disease  Dermatomyositis  Guillain-Barre syndrome Iritis  Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis  Multiple sclerosis  Osteoporosis  Pemphigus  Psoriasis  Psoriatic arthritis  Rheumatoid arthritis  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Ulcerative colitis Wegener's granulomatosis
Is it safe to use medicine while I am pregnant?,"'There is no clear-cut answer to this question. Before you start or stop any medicine, it is always best to speak with the doctor who is caring for you while you are ''pregnant''. Read on to learn about deciding to use medicine while pregnant.' "
How should I decide whether to use a medicine while I am pregnant?,"'When deciding whether or not to use a medicine in ''pregnancy'"", you and your doctor need to talk about the medicine's benefits and risks.""'There may be times during pregnancy when using medicine is a choice. Some of the medicine choices you and your doctor make while you are pregnant may differ from the choices you make when you are not pregnant. For example, if you get a ''cold'', you may decide to ""live with"" your stuffy nose instead of using the ""stuffy nose"" medicine you use when you are not pregnant.''Other times, using medicine is not a choice - it is needed. Some women need to use medicines while they are pregnant. Sometimes, women need medicine for a few days or a couple of weeks to treat a problem like a''bladder infection'' or ''strep throat''. Other women need to use medicine every day to control long-term health problems like ''asthma'', ''diabetes'', ''depression'', or ''seizures''. Also, some women have a pregnancy problem that needs medicine treatment. These problems include severe''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', earlier pregnancy losses, or preterm ''labor''.' Benefits: what are the good things the medicine can do for me and my growing baby (fetus)? 
	 Risks: what are the ways the medicine might harm me or my growing baby (fetus)?"
Where do doctors and nurses find out about using medicines during pregnancy?,"'Doctors and nurses get information from medicine labels and packages, textbooks, and research journals. They also share knowledge with other doctors and nurses and talk to the people who make and sell medicines.'""The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the part of our country's government that controls the medicines that can and can't be sold in the United States. The FDA lets a company sell a medicine in the United States if it is safe to use and works for a certain problem. Companies that make medicines usually have to show FDA doctors and scientists whether ""'birth defects'' or other problems occur in baby animals when the medicine is given to pregnant animals. Most of the time, ''drugs'' are not studied in pregnant women.''The FDA works with the drug companies to make clear and complete labels. But in most cases, there is not much information about how a medicine affects pregnant women and their growing ''babies''. Many prescription medicine labels include the results of studies done in pregnant animals. But a medicine does not always affect growing humans and animals in the same way. Here is an example:''A medicine is given to pregnant rats. If the medicine causes problems in some of the rat babies, it may or may not cause problems in human babies. If there are no problems in the rat babies, it does not prove that the medicine will not cause problems in human babies.The FDA asks for studies in two different kinds of animals. This improves the chance that the studies can predict what may happen in pregnant women and their babies.\t'""There is a lot that FDA doctors and scientists do not know about using medicine during pregnancy. In a perfect world, every medicine label would include helpful information about the medicine's effects on pregnant women and their growing babies. Unfortunately, this is not the case."" "
What are examples of prescription medications that are safe to use during pregnancy?,"'Doctors use information from many sources when they choose medicine for a patient, including medicine labels. To help doctors, the FDA created pregnancy letter categories to help explain what is known about using medicine during pregnancy. This system assigns letter categories to all prescription medicines. The letter category is listed in the label of a prescription medicine. The label states whether studies were done in pregnant women or pregnant animals and if so, what happened. ''Over-the-counter'' (OTC) medicines do not have a pregnancy letter category. Some OTC medicines were prescription medicines first and used to have a letter category. Talk to your doctor and follow the instructions on the label before taking OTC medicines.'""The FDA chooses a medicine's letter category based on what is known about the medicine when used in pregnant women and animals.""'The FDA is working hard to gather more knowledge about using medicine during pregnancy. The FDA is also trying to make medicine labels more helpful to doctors. Medicine label information for prescription medicines is now changing, and the pregnancy part of the label will change over the next few years.' "
What over-the-counter (OTC) medications are safe to use during pregnancy?,"'Keep in mind that other things like ''caffeine'', ''vitamins'', and herbal remedies can affect the growing fetus. Talk with your doctor about cutting down on ''caffeine'' and ask which type of vitamin you should take. Never use an herbal product without talking to your doctor first.''All OTC medicines have a Drug Facts label. The Drug Facts label is arranged the same way on all OTC medicines. This makes information about using the medicine easier to find. One section of the Drug Facts label is for pregnant women. With OTC medicines, the label usually tells a pregnant woman to speak with her doctor before using the medicine. Some OTC medicines are known to cause certain problems in pregnancy. The labels for these medicines give pregnant women facts about why and when they should not use the medicine. Here are some examples:''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') like ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil''®, ''Motrin''®), ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''®), and ''aspirin'' (acetylsalicylate), can cause serious blood flow problems in the baby if used during the last third of pregnancy (after 28 weeks). Also, aspirin may increase the chance for bleeding problems in the mother and the baby during pregnancy or at delivery.''The labels for ''nicotine'' therapy drugs, like the ''nicotine patch'' and lozenge, remind women that ''smoking'' can harm an unborn child. While the medicine is thought to be safer than ''smoking'', the risks of the medicine are not fully known. Pregnant ''smokers'' are told to try quitting without the medicine first.' "
What if I'm thinking about getting pregnant?,"'If you are not pregnant yet, you can help your chances for having a healthy baby by planning ahead. Schedule a pre-pregnancy checkup. At this visit, you can talk to your doctor about the medicines, ''vitamins'', and herbs you use. It is very important that you keep treating your health problems while you are pregnant. Your doctor can tell you if you need to switch your medicine. Ask about vitamins for women who are trying to get pregnant. All women who can get pregnant should take a daily vitamin with ''folic acid'' (a B vitamin) to prevent birth defects of the brain and spinal cord. You should begin taking these vitamins before you become pregnant or if you could become pregnant. It is also a good idea to discuss caffeine, ''alcohol'', and ''smoking'' with your doctor at this time.' "
Is it safe to use medicine while I am trying to become pregnant?,"'It is hard to know exactly when you will get pregnant. Once you do get pregnant, you may not know you are pregnant for 10 to 14 days or longer. Before you start trying to get pregnant, it is wise to schedule a meeting with your doctor to discuss medicines that you use daily or every now and then. Sometimes, medicines should be changed, and sometimes they can be stopped before a woman gets pregnant. Each woman is different. So you should discuss your medicines with your doctor rather than making medicine changes on your own.' Do not stop any prescribed medicines without first talking to your doctor. 
	 Talk to your doctor before using any over-the-counter medicine.
	"
What if I get sick and need to use medicine while I am pregnant?,"'Whether or not you should use medicine during pregnancy is a serious question to discuss with your doctor. Some health problems need treatment. Not using a medicine that you need could harm you and your baby. For example, a ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI'') that is not treated may become a ''kidney infection''. Kidney infections can cause preterm ''labor'' and low birth weight. An antibiotic is needed to get rid of a ''UTI''. Ask your doctor whether the benefits of taking a certain medicine outweigh the risks for you and your baby.' "
Should you stop taking medications during pregnancy if you have health problems?,"'If you are pregnant or thinking about ''becoming pregnant'', you should talk to your doctor about your medicines. Do not stop or change them on your own. This includes medicines for ''depression'', ''asthma'', ''diabetes'', ''seizures'' (''epilepsy''), and other health problems. Not using medicine that you need may be more harmful to you and your baby than using the medicine.''For women living with ''HIV'', the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends using ''zidovudine'' (AZT) during pregnancy. Studies show that ''HIV'' positive women who use AZT during pregnancy greatly lower the risk of passing ''HIV'' to their babies. If a diabetic woman does not use her medicine during pregnancy, she raises her risk for ''miscarriage'', ''stillbirth'', and some birth defects. If ''asthma'' and ''high blood pressure'' are not controlled during pregnancy, problems with the fetus may result.' "
Are vitamins safe for me while I am pregnant?,"'Regular ''multivitamins'' and ''prenatal vitamins'' are safe to take during pregnancy and can be helpful. Women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant should take a daily multivitamin or ''prenatal'' vitamin that contains at least 400 micrograms (µg) of folic acid. It is best to start taking these vitamins before you become pregnant or if you could become pregnant. Folic acid reduces the chance of a baby having a neural tube defect, like ''spina bifida'', where the spine or brain does not form the right way. See our information on Folic Acid. Iron can help prevent a low blood count (''anemia'""). It's important to take the vitamin dose prescribed by your doctor. Too many vitamins can harm your baby. For example, very high levels of ""'vitamin A'' have been linked with severe birth defects.''''Vaccines'' and Pregnancy''''''Vaccines'' protect your body against dangerous diseases. Some ''vaccines'' are not safe to receive during pregnancy. For some vaccines, the decision to give a ''vaccine'"" during pregnancy depends on a pregnant woman's own situation. Her doctor may consider these questions before giving a vaccine:""'The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that ''Hepatitis B'' vaccination should be considered when women are at risk for developing''Hepatitis B'' during pregnancy, and inactivated ''influenza'' vaccine  should be considered for women who are pregnant during ''flu'' season. On the other hand, a pregnant woman who is not immune to ''rubella'' (''German measles'') is not given a ''rubella'' vaccine until after pregnancy. Talk with your doctor to make sure you are fully protected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides ''vaccine guidelines for pregnant women''.'   Is there is a high chance she will be exposed to the disease?  Would the infection pose a risk to the mother or fetus?  Is the vaccine unlikely to cause harm? "
Are herbal remedies or natural products safe for me when I am pregnant?,"'Except for some vitamins, little is known about using ''dietary supplements'' while pregnant. Some herbal remedy labels claim they will help with pregnancy. But, most often there are no good studies to show if these claims are true or if the herb can cause harm to or your baby. Talk with your doctor before using any herbal product or dietary supplement. These products may contain things that could harm you or your growing baby during your pregnancy.''In the United States, there are different laws for medicines and for dietary ''supplements''. The part of the FDA that controls dietary ''supplements'' is the same part that controls foods sold in the United States. Only dietary supplements containing new dietary ingredients that were not marketed before October 15, 1994, submit safety information for review by the FDA. However, unlike medicines, herbal remedies and ""natural products"" are not approved by the FDA for safety or for what they say they will do. Most have not even been evaluated for their potential to cause harm to you or the growing fetus, let alone shown to be safe for use in pregnancy. Before a company can sell a medicine, the company must complete many studies and send the results to the FDA. Many scientists and doctors at the FDA check the study results. The FDA allows the medicine to be sold only if the studies show that the medicine works and is safe to use.' "
"In the future, will there be better ways to know if medicines are safe to use during pregnancy?","'At this time, drugs are rarely tested for safety in pregnant women for fear of harming the unborn baby. Until this changes, pregnancy exposure registries help doctors and researchers learn how medicines affect pregnant mothers and their growing baby. A pregnancy exposure registry is a study that enrolls pregnant women who are using a certain medicine. The women sign up for the study while pregnant and are followed for a certain length of time after the baby is born. Researchers compare babies with mothers who used the medicine while pregnant to babies with mothers who did not use the medicine. This type of study compares large groups of pregnant mothers and babies to look for medicine effects. A woman and her doctor can use registry results to make more informed choices about using medicine while pregnant.''If you are pregnant and are using a medicine or were using one when you got pregnant, check to see if there is a pregnancy exposure registry for that medicine. The Food and Drug Administration has a list of pregnancy exposure registries (http://www.fda.gov/womens/registries/default.htm) that pregnant women can join.' "

What is dry eye syndrome?,"'Dry eye syndrome (DES) -- also called dry eye, dry eye disease, or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) -- is a common condition of the tear film that affects a significant percentage of the population, especially those older than 40 years of age. Dry eye syndrome can affect any race and is more common in women than in men. Another term used for dry eye is ocular surface disease.' "
What is the impact of dry eye syndrome?,"'More than 3 million American women over the age of 50 have moderate to severe ''dry eyes'', while more than 1.5 million American men over the age of 50 are similarly afflicted. Millions of others have mild dry eyes. In the majority of these people, this health condition is benign and easily treated with artificial tears.''Many wearers of ''contact lenses'' experience dry eyes at some point with many discontinuing or limiting ''lens'' wear. Dry eye is a significant finding in patients having undergone refractive surgery, especially ''LASIK''.''In addition to affecting ocular health, the discomfort and irritation of dry eyes can cause deterioration of general well-being, emotional health, and social functioning. Studies have demonstrated that people with dry eye syndrome are three times more likely than those without dry eyes to have difficulty with reading, computer work, watching TV, and driving. Direct costs of dry eyes, such as frequent physician visits, diagnostic tests, and charges for medication and surgery impact our health care resources. In addition, there are immeasurable indirect costs related to decreased productivity and efficiency and lost work time.' "
What causes dry eye syndrome? What are the types of dry eye disease?,"""Dry eye syndrome is a common disorder of the normal tear film that results from decreased tear production, excessive tear evaporation, and an abnormality in the production of mucus or lipids normally found in the tear layer, or a combination of these. Aqueous (watery) tear deficiency is caused by either poor production of watery tears or excessive evaporation of the watery tear layer. Poor production of tears by the tear glands may be a result of age, hormonal changes, or various autoimmune diseases, such as primary Sjögren's syndrome, ""'rheumatoid arthritis'', or ''systemic lupus erythematosus''. Evaporative loss of the watery tear layer is usually a result of an insufficient overlying lipid layer.''Some medications, such as ''antihistamines'', ''antidepressants'', ''beta-blockers'', and ''oral contraceptives'', may decrease tear production.''If blinking decreases or if the eyelids cannot be closed, the eyes may dry out because of tear evaporation. While reading, watching TV, or performing a task that requires close attention with the eyes, a person may not blink as often. This decreased blinking allows excessive evaporation of the tears. Certain health conditions, such as ''stroke'"" or Bell's palsy, make it difficult to close the eyes. As a result, the eyes may become dry from tear evaporation.""'Abnormal production of mucin by the conjunctiva may occur. This can result from chemical (alkali) ''burns'' to the eye or because of different autoimmune diseases, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and cicatricial pemphigoid. This abnormal production leads to poor spreading of the tears over the surface of the eye. The surface of the eye can dry out and even become damaged despite the presence of sufficient watery tears.''Insufficient lipid layers are the result of meibomian gland dysfunction, ''rosacea'', or following oral ''isotretinoin'' medication. Meibomian glands are the oil glands in the eyelids that produce the lipid layer. If these oil glands become blocked or if the oil is too thick, there may not be enough oil to cover the watery tear layer to prevent its evaporation.''In addition, if an infection is present along the eyelids or the eyelashes (called ''blepharitis'') the bacteria may break down the oil, so there may not be enough oil. This may lead to evaporative loss of tears and dry eyes.'  "
What are the risk factors for dry eye syndrome?,"'Dry eye syndrome is more common with increasing age, female sex, and Asian ethnicity. ''Menopause'' can increase the risk of dry eye syndrome. Paradoxically, ''postmenopausal'' women on ''hormone replacement therapy'', especially ''estrogens'"" alone, have a higher prevalence of dry eyes than postmenopausal women who don't take hormones.""'Occupational and environmental factors increasing risk include low humidity, high room temperature, wind exposure, pollution and poor air quality, ''smoking'', and decreased blink rates due to sustained computer use or reading.''Diseases associated with dry eyes include ''vitamin A'' deficiency (historically known as xerophthalmia), ''acne rosacea'', autoimmune/connective tissue disease, ''hepatitis C'' infection, ''HIV'"" infection, Sjögren's syndrome, ""'sarcoidosis'', ''diabetes mellitus'', and ''androgen'' or estrogen deficiency.''Wearing contact lenses increases the risk of dry eye syndrome. Refractive surgery, especially ''LASIK'', frequently causes dry eyes.''A ''diet'' low in ''omega-3 fatty acids'' or a ''diet'' with a relatively high amount of omega-6 fatty acids relative to ''omega-3 fatty acids'' can also increase the risk of dry eye syndrome.''Various types of medications, including systemic ''chemotherapy'', diuretics, antidepressants, antihistamines and beta-adrenergic blockers, may cause dry eyes as a side effect of the medication.''Irregularities of the ''conjunctival'' surface as seen with pingueculae or pterygia, can cause dry eye symptoms. Abnormalities of the blink mechanism or mechanical lid abnormalities can also produce DES symptoms.' "
What are dry eye syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'A person with dry eye syndrome may experience dry, gritty/scratchy, or filmy feeling, burning or ''itching'', ''redness of the eyes'' (''conjunctivitis''), ''blurred vision'', foreign body sensation, and light sensitivity.''Dry eye symptoms seem to worsen in dry or windy climates and with higher temperatures and lower humidity. Symptoms may also be worse with prolonged use of the eyes (for example, while reading and watching TV) and toward the end of the day.''Sometimes a symptom of dry eye syndrome may actually be intermittent excessive tearing. With dry eye, when the eyes becomes slightly dry and irritated, it may initiate reflex tearing with the production of a large amount of tears all at once to try to get moist and comfortable again. Unfortunately, the eyes can only handle so many tears at any one time; the rest pour over the eyelids and down the cheeks. A short time later, the eyes will become slightly dry and irritated again and the whole process may repeat itself.'  "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose dry eye syndrome?,"'During an eye examination, an ''eye care'' specialist (ophthalmologist) will most likely be able to diagnose dry eye syndrome just by ''hearing'"" the patient's complaints about his or her eyes. A health care professional can confirm the diagnosis of dry eyes by observing signs of dry eyes. As part of the eye examination, a doctor may""""An ophthalmologist may use different dyes during a patient's eye examination. An eye care specialist will place the dyes into the tears in the form of a drop. Fluorescein is a yellow dye that stains the cornea where epithelial (surface) cells have been worn away because of the lack of an adequate protective tear film. Rose Bengal is a red dye that stains the cornea and the conjunctiva where the cells are dead or dying as well as where healthy cells are inadequately protected by the tear film. Lissamine Green is a green dye that can help differentiate between normal and abnormal surface cells of the cornea and conjunctiva.""'Schirmer tests measure the amount of tears produced by the eyes. The ophthalmologist places the end of a thin strip of filter paper just inside the lower ''eyelid''. After a minute, the doctor removes the filter paper, and the amount of wetting is measured. Less wetting of the filter paper is more indicative of dry eye syndrome.''The osmolarity (salt content) of the tears may be measured. This is a new test that aids in the diagnosis of dry eye syndrome, in which tear osmolarity is increased over normal levels.'""Another new test on the tears can detect the presence of MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9), a substance which, when present in the tears, is a reliable marker for the presence of early ocular surface disease and dry eye. This test may be helpful to identify patients with ocular surface inflammation and autoimmune disease and may facilitate the decision to institute anti-inflammatory treatment in these patients. If autoimmune diseases or Sjögren's syndrome are suspected as a cause of a patient's dry eye syndrome, blood tests may be performed. These blood tests check for the presence of different autoantibodies that may be associated with dry eye syndrome.""""Rarely, a doctor may perform a biopsy of the salivary glands. Certain disease processes, such as Sjögren's syndrome, affect both the salivary glands, which produce saliva in your mouth, and the lacrimal glands, which produce tears."" examine the front of the eyes is examined using a special microscope, called a slit lamp; inspect the amount and thickness of the tear film; assess the stability of the tear film by checking the tear breakup time; inspect the eyelids for signs of inflammation; examine the Meibomian glands of the lids and their openings into the tear film; assess the conjunctiva to determine if it is too dry or inflamed; and check the cornea to see if it has dried out or become damaged. If both the cornea and conjunctiva are involved, the condition is known as keratoconjunctivitis."
What are over-the-counter medical treatments for dry eye syndrome?,"'Although no cure exists for dry eye syndrome, many medical treatments are available. Treatment is dependent on the severity of the condition; some people may only require a humidifier or occasional eye drops while others may require surgery to help decrease dry eyes.''Over-the-counter'' lubricating eye drops, commonly referred to as artificial tears, may help relieve dry eyes. Some examples of these products include 20/20 Tears, Celluvisc, Comfort Tears, Dry Eyes, Murine, Refresh, Genteal, Soothe, TheraTears, Systane and Tears Naturale. Most of these are available in a preservative free packaging, which reduces the possibility of irritation from preservatives. One should avoid tear substitutes containing a vasoconstrictor such as naphazoline, tetrahydrozoline, phenylephrine, and oxymetazoline. A doctor may also prescribe medications to help a patient with dry eye syndrome.'  "
What types of medications (prescriptions) are used in the medical treatment of dry eye syndrome?,"""A major portion of the ophthalmologist's decision about prescription treatment of DES is based on determining whether the problem is primarily evaporative or aqueous-deficient, or a combination of both. There is a great deal of overlap between evaporative and aqueous-deficient dry eye.""'Certain prescription medications may help with dry eye syndrome. An eye care professional may prescribe eye lubricants, such as ''Lacrisert'', an artificial tear insert. The insert is similar to a contact lens, and the patient will need to insert the eye lubricant one to two times per day. Cellulose is contained in the insert and acts to stabilize and thicken the film of tears over the eyes and to prolong the time the tear film works. ''Corneal abrasion'"" may occur if the artificial tear insert isn't inserted properly.""'Certain prescription medications may help with dry eye syndrome. ''Cyclosporine'' A 0.5% (''Restasis'') helps decrease any inflammation on the surface of the eye. This inflammation decreases the ability of the eyes to maintain a healthy tear film. Used twice a day, cyclosporine 0.5% helps people make more, healthier tears on their own. Lifitegrast 5% (Xiidra) is another approved prescription eye drop that reduces inflammation in the tear glands. ''Corticosteroid'' drops (Lotemax, Alrex, ''FML'', ''Vexol'""), either alone or used in conjunction with cyclosporine or Lifitegrast, reduce the signs and symptoms of dry eye. Although the FDA has not yet approved this group of drops for the medical treatment of dry eye syndrome, many ophthalmologists use them. Corticosteroid drops, if used in excess, may have some side effects, but new formulations with fewer side effects have become available. Like all medications, patients should only use these under a doctor's supervision and according to her or his instructions. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drops (""'Voltaren'', ''Acular'', Nevanac, and Xibrom) likewise reduce the inflammation associated with dry eye syndrome.''People with ''blepharitis'' or meibomian gland dysfunction need antibiotics. The patient will use antibiotic ophthalmic drops or ointments, such as ''erythromycin'', ''azithromycin'' and bacitracin, among others, for about seven to 10 days to decrease the number of bacteria that break down the lipid layer of the tear film. In ointment form, these also lubricate the eyes overnight. Oral antibiotics, particularly azithromycin and ''doxycycline'' or other ''tetracycline'', not only help to decrease the number of bacteria, but also help to make the oil more fluid so it flows out of the oil glands more easily. This is often used if a person has ''rosacea''. There are many people who have ''rosacea'' of the eyelids, suffer from dry eye syndrome, and do not have the typical changes of rosacea on the rest of the face.''Other physician prescribed medications may include drops prepared by a compounding pharmacy such as autologous serum or hormonal drops.' "
Can self-care treatments and remedies help alleviate dry eyes?,"'To help alleviate the symptoms of dry eye syndrome, certain self-care tips at home may help. A humidifier puts more moisture into the air. With more moisture in the air, tears evaporate more slowly, keeping the eyes more comfortable. Both furnaces in the winter and air conditioning in the summer decrease the humidity in the air. Excessive air movement dries out the eyes. Avoid having excessive air movement by decreasing the speed of ceiling fans and/or oscillating fans. Large amounts of dust or other particulate matter in the air may worsen the symptoms of dry eye. In those situations, an air filter may be helpful.''Warm compresses and eyelid scrubs/''massage'' with baby shampoo help by providing a thicker, more stable lipid layer. This is especially helpful if a person has meibomian gland dysfunction, rosacea, or blepharitis. The heat (careful, warm compresses should not be too hot; the compress should be comfortable if placed on your wrist) warms up the oil in the oil glands, making it flow more easily; the mild massaging action helps get the oil out of the glands. The cleansing action decreases the number of bacteria that break down the oil.''Artificial tears and lubricating eyedrops and gels (available over the counter) help provide more moisture and lubrication for the surface of the eye. Individuals typically use lubricating eyedrops about four times a day, but they can be used as often as needed. Doctors recommend preservative-free solutions for those who wish to use tears more than six times a day. There is no single over-the-counter drop that is best for everybody. Each individual will determine which drop provides the most relief from symptoms. Some drops may have a longer time effect than others.''Lubricating eye ointments are much thicker than eye drops and gels. Because ointments are so thick, they last much longer than eye drops and gels. However, because of their thickness, ointments may blur vision if people use them during the day. Therefore, people typically use ointments to lubricate the eyes overnight during ''sleep''.''If the eyes are dry mainly while reading or watching TV, taking frequent breaks to allow the eyes to rest and become moist and comfortable again is helpful. Closing the eyes for 10 seconds every five to 10 minutes will increase comfort, as will blinking more frequently.''Taking a ''fish oil'' (or other high quality source of ''omega-3'' fatty acids) supplement every day can often be helpful in alleviating symptoms of dry eye.' "
What is chronic dry eye syndrome?,'Chronic dry eye syndrome is a persistent condition of dry eyes that may wax and wane over an extended period of time. Removing environmental influences or reducing contact lens wear does not provide relief.' 
Can surgery treat dry eye syndrome?,"'Different minor surgical procedures may help decrease dry eye syndrome. Near the inner corner of each eyelid are tiny openings, called punctae, that are the beginning of the normal tear drainage system. From there, tears normally flow through naso-lacrimal ducts into the nose. Punctal occlusion helps by decreasing the normal drainage of the tears from the ocular surface and down the tear drainage system, into the back of the nose, and down the throat. This occlusion is usually done by a very simple office procedure and only takes a few minutes. An eye care professional can place different punctal plugs or lacrimal canalicular plugs at or just inside these openings to block the normal drainage of tears down the tear drainage system. Just like a stopper placed in the drain of a sink keeps the water from flowing down the drain, these plugs keep the tears from flowing down the tear drainage system. Therefore, the eyes stay more moist and comfortable, even if one has fewer tears. Ophthalmologists can remove these plugs very easily, if necessary. Sometimes, in severe cases of dry eye syndrome, eye care professionals permanently close these openings, usually by cautery (burning) or laser. This accomplishes the same thing as the plugs, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to reverse.'""If a person has difficulty closing the eyes for any reason, such as Bell's palsy, the eyes may dry out because of tear evaporation. Lateral tarsorrhaphy is a procedure during which the lateral (outside) one-third of the eyelids are sewn together to decrease the ability of the eye to open widely and to help the eyes close more easily. If ""'stroke'' or nerve damage keeps the eyelids from closing properly, a doctor may implant a small gold weight into the upper eyelid to help it close.' "
What are other therapies that treat dry eye syndrome?,"'Sometimes, people ''sleep'' with their eyes slightly open. If a person sleeps this way, he or she might want to tape the eyes shut at night.''Moisture chambers are ''plastic'' shields (similar to swim goggles) that help keep the eyes from drying out by decreasing the evaporation of tears off the eye. A person may use the moisture chambers just at night if he or she sleeps with his or her eyes slightly open, or they may be used all day, if necessary.' "
What are the health complications of dry eye syndrome?,"'Most people with dry eye syndrome have nothing to worry about aside from an annoying inconvenience. Although the symptoms might make activities of daily living (for example, reading, watching TV, driving) miserable, no long-term ''vision loss'' is to be expected.''For those with more severe dry eye syndrome, significant drying of the surface of the eye can lead to an increased risk of serious infections. Ultimately, scarring, thinning, and even perforation of the cornea may occur. As a result, vision, or even the eye itself, may be permanently damaged or function lost.'  "
What is the prognosis of dry eye syndrome?,"'Although dry eye syndrome can be very symptomatic, it is seldom a cause of significant visual loss. Most cases are benign and easily treated with artificial tears. Although ulcers of the cornea can occur, they are extremely rare.' "
Is it possible to prevent dry eye syndrome?,"'Avoiding environmental causes of dry eye can be helpful in ''prevention''. If the eyes are dry mainly while reading or watching TV, taking frequent breaks to allow the eyes to rest and become moist and comfortable again is helpful. Closing the eyes for 10 seconds every five to 10 minutes will increase comfort, as will blinking more frequently.''Taking a fish oil (or other high quality source of omega-3 fatty acids) supplement every day can often be helpful in alleviating symptoms of dry eye.' "
What is dry mouth?,"'Dry mouth'' is a condition that results from a decreased volume of saliva in the mouth. ''Dry mouth'' is also called xerostomia. Xerostomia can make it difficult to speak, eat, and digest food and can lead to malnutrition. Extreme dry mouth and salivary gland dysfunction can produce significant ''anxiety'"", permanent mouth, and throat disorders, and can impair a person's quality of life.""  "
How common is dry mouth?,'Dry mouth affects about 10% of all people and tends to be more prevalent in women than men. Disorders of saliva production affect elderly people and those who are taking prescription and nonprescription medications most frequently.' 
What are the benefits of saliva?,"'Saliva is an essential part of a healthy mouth and is often taken for granted. The lubricating properties of saliva provide comfort and help protect the oral tissues against ulcers, sores, and other frictional movements that accompany normal eating and speaking. Saliva neutralizes acids and helps defend against ''tooth decay'', and bacterial, viral, or fungal threats. Saliva helps digest food and helps ''teeth'"" in remineralization. Saliva is also a very essential contributor to a person's ability to taste, as it acts as a solvent for the taste stimuli. When saliva volume is insufficient, all of these functions are impaired."" "
What causes dry mouth?,"'There are many causes of dry mouth. Dry mouth most commonly occurs as a side effect of medications that cause decreased saliva production, including ''high blood pressure'' medications, ''antihistamines'', ''antidepressants'' (such as ''Wellbutrin'', ''Lexapro'' and ''Zoloft''), diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, steroids (such as ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone''), ''amphetamines'' (such as ''Adderall''), and many others. There are over 400 commonly used medications that can cause dry mouth. Sometimes the dry mouth goes away, but usually it continues as long as the medication is being used. Other causes of dry mouth include ''dehydration'', ''radiation'' treatments to treat cancerous tumors of the head and neck, salivary gland diseases, removal of salivary glands, ''diabetes'', ''smoking'', using ''chewing tobacco'', hormonal imbalances, ''sinusitis'', mouth ''breathing'', ''sleep apnea'', ''cystic fibrosis'', ''mumps'', ''hypothyroidism'"", and autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren's syndrome, ""'rheumatoid arthritis'', ''HIV/AIDS'', and ''systemic lupus erythematosus''. ''Eating disorders'', such as ''bulimia'' and ''anorexia'', are other risk factors for developing xerostomia. Salivary production can be decreased if a major salivary duct becomes blocked, such as from a salivary stone or infection. Other risk factors include ''stress'', ''anxiety'', and ''depression''. '""Alzheimer's""' disease and '""Parkinson's""' disease often lead to ''dehydration'', making a person constantly at risk for dry mouth. These along with ''stroke'' can cause a perception of dry mouth even if salivary function is adequate, due to the diminished ability to perceive oral sensations.''Nerve damage or ''trauma'' to the head and neck can affect the nerves that provide sensation to the mouth and result in a feeling of dry mouth.''Shortness of breath'' may be caused by a ''panic attack'', or ''anxiety'', which can cause dry mouth. But shortness of breath may also be an indicator of serious respiratory or circulatory problems (such as a ''heart attack'').''Dry mouth often occurs in ''pregnancy'' or ''breastfeeding'' due to dehydration and hormonal changes and is often accompanied by ''nausea''.''Those undergoing treatment for obstructive ''sleep apnea'', including ''CPAP'', may experience dry mouth. This is typically due to any of the following:''Consultation with the physician managing the ''sleep'' apnea can be helpful.'   A mask leak Sleeping with an open mouth Non-humidified air"
What are dry mouth symptoms and signs?,"'People complaining of dry mouth may exhibit some or all of the following symptoms:''Fungal infections'"" occurring in an individual with dry mouth may be associated with another underlying disease or disorder such as Addison's disease, ""'HIV'', or ''diabetes''. The most common sign of fungal infection of the mouth is burning tongue or white or dark plaque on the tongue or soft tissues of the mouth. Frequently, a dry mouth may manifest mostly at night during sleeping, especially in mouth-breathers.' Dry feeling in mouth Dry feeling in throat, sore throat Frequent thirst Difficulty speaking, chewing, and swallowing (dysphagia) Increased need to drink liquids in order to swallow Diminished or altered sense of taste Chapped or cracked lips Hoarseness Dry eyes Pale gums Headaches, dizziness Bad breath Persistent cough Dry nasal passages Dry corners of mouth Nausea Mouth sores, ulcers Difficulty wearing dentures White tongue indicative of a fungal infection like yeast (candidiasis) Burning, sore, or tingling sensation in mouth, tongue, or throat Red, bleeding gums, gingivitis, and periodontitis Tooth decay -- especially around the gum line or on the root surfaces"
What specialists treat dry mouth?,"'The type of doctor who should treat dry mouth depends on the cause. A person noticing symptoms of dry mouth should first consult with their dentist for a consult and exam. A general dentist will do a review of medications, health history, lifestyle, ''diet'', and other things that could contribute to dry mouth. They will then perform an intraoral examination to confirm diminished salivary flow and to determine the effects it has had on the dentition and oral tissues. The management and maintenance of ''oral health'' will be the most important element of this relationship.''If it is determined that there is salivary gland dysfunction, the dentist may partner with an ENT physician who specializes in salivary gland disorders to help improve the condition.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose dry mouth?,"'When dry mouth is observed, the dentist can be helpful in determining the cause of dry mouth and obtaining a proper diagnosis. The diagnosis will help in developing a plan for management and treatment. The dentist will inspect the main salivary glands and ducts to check for blockages and may measure both stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow. The lips, tongue, and oral tissues will all be inspected for dryness. Sometimes a patient will still complain of dry mouth even if salivary flow is adequate. Since the symptoms of dry mouth vary greatly from individual to individual, treatments vary. Sometimes treatments are given for prolonged, chronic complaint of dry mouth, even without clinical signs of changes within the mouth. The dentist can be an important resource for specific information to manage dry mouth.' "
What are home remedies and treatment options for dry mouth?,"'Those seeking treatment for dry mouth will most likely want something to provide comfort and relief. Most are ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) remedies. Treatment for dry mouth can be divided into the following four categories: saliva preservation, saliva substitution, saliva stimulation, and ''prevention'' of ''caries'', and yeast (''Candida'') infection.''Saliva preservation'': If salivary content is low, one must do as much as possible to keep the oral tissues as moist as possible and limit the things that can dry the mouth out. Those experiencing dry mouth should try to breathe through their nose as much as possible, and limit mouth breathing. Avoiding ''caffeine'', ''alcohol'"", and tobacco is very important. Using a humidifier to introduce more moisture to a room or at bedside can be helpful, especially while sleeping. Don't use OTC antihistamines or decongestants, as they can dry the mouth out as well.""'Saliva substitution'"": There are many home remedies to help replace the moisture that saliva provides to the mouth. These include drinking water more frequently throughout the day, especially while eating. Sucking ice chips throughout the day will help the mouth remain as moist as possible. A mouthwash can be helpful, but it can also be harmful. When selecting a mouthwash, the person must choose a product that doesn't contain alcohol, such as Biotene, for alcohol-based products will only cause further mouth dryness. Closys mouthwash can be extremely beneficial due to its absence of alcohol and excellent germ-killing properties. Artificial OTC saliva substitutes and oral lubricants containing ""'glycerin'"" will provide help during eating and speaking. They won't cure xerostomia, but will provide some relief. Moisturizing the lips with a balm or Vaseline can also be helpful.""'Saliva stimulation'': Chewing gum can help stimulate salivary flow, but it is important to remember not to use gum or candies that have ''sugar'' in them or the person will be placed at greater risk for developing ''cavities''. ''Sugar''-free lemon drops, lozenges, or other hard candies can also help stimulate the salivary glands. Other remedies include medications that help increase salivary flow such as ''pilocarpine'' (''Salagen'') and ''cevimeline'' (''Evoxac''). These prescription medications are to be avoided by people with ''asthma'' or ''glaucoma''.''Prevention of caries and ''Candida'' infection'': ''Cavities'', ''gingivitis'', periodontal disease, and fungal infections are common complications of dry mouth. A dry oral environment makes plaque control more difficult, so meticulous oral care and hygiene becomes essential in preventing rampant caries, ''gingivitis'', and periodontal disease. The affected individual should incorporate a low-sugar ''diet'' and begin daily use of fluoride treatments and antimicrobial rinses to combat the effects oral dryness has on the ''teeth'' and oral tissues. Prescription toothpastes that contain more fluoride, calcium, and phosphate will help protect and remineralize teeth where necessary. Frequent visits to the dentist are necessary to help manage these complications. Since people with dry mouth often develop fungal infections such as ''thrush'' (''oral candidiasis''), they may require topical antifungal treatment such as rinses and dissolving tablets. ''Dentures'' often harbor fungal infections, so they should be soaked daily in chlorhexidine or 1% bleach.'  "
Is it possible to prevent dry mouth?,"'There is really no prevention of dry mouth, only the side effects of dry mouth. It is vital to detect, diagnose, and treat xerostomia as early as possible to avoid the devastating consequences of chronic dry mouth on dental and overall health.' "
What is the prognosis of dry mouth?,"'The prognosis (outlook) depends on the underlying cause of the dry mouth. Management should be focused on eliminating the cause when possible, such as with dehydration, ''anemia'', and ''stress'"". If the cause can't be eliminated, then it is necessary to keep the affected person as comfortable and free from caries and ""'Candida'' ''yeast infection'' as possible. By using simple techniques to help stimulate saliva, substitute for saliva, and protect the teeth and surrounding tissues, one can expect a very good prognosis for avoiding the side effects of dry mouth.' "
What is dandruff?,"'The exact origin of the term is rather obscure. ''Dander'' consists of white to tan flakes found on fur or feathers. ''Ruff'', the second syllable, probably originates from the word ''scurfy'', which means scale arising from the most superficial layer of the skin. In any case, ''dandruff'' ''is the popular term for the small white flakes that conspicuously appear on the shoulders of your black sweater or blouse after your scratch your ''flaky scalp''. This is distinctly different from the much larger white flakes and dead skin cells that can result from ''psoriasis'', a skin disease that can respond to coal tar treatments. ''Dandruff'' is also not from a fungal infection that could respond to ''ketoconazole''. ''Dandruff'' is also distinctly different from ''eczema'' that responds to cortisone creams and ''contact dermatitis'', which is an immune reaction to a chemical or metal.' "
What is dry scalp?,"'Dry ''scalp'' is simply ''dry skin'"" in the densely haired area on the top of one's head. ""'Dry ''scalp'"" is not a medical term and really shouldn't be used to describe any disease involving excess scale noted in the hair. Unlike other parts of the body, the scalp is naturally very oily and greasy. This is true for two reasons:""'I do not believe that dry scalp is a common problem. The belief that excess scale in the scalp is ever due to dryness is almost always incorrect and can lead to mistreatment of the real cause. So for the remainder of the article, I will refrain from using the term ''dry scalp''.' The skin in the scalp area produces more skin grease (sebum) that originates from hair follicles and the skin than any other anatomical region. Realistically, the most anyone washes their hair is once a day, and frequently much less often than that. Shampooing with soap is responsible for removing moisturizing fats (lipids) that naturally accumulate on the scalp and hair to prevent dryness and flaking. It would require multiple washes per day of a hairless scalp to achieve significant drying (xerosis). Dry skin (xerodermatitis) does not just happen because of dry air, but it can occur because of hormones out of balance (such as hypothyroidism) and with increasing age."
What are causes and risk factors for dandruff?,"'The presence of ''dandruff'"" in abundance is a clue to either the presence of an inflammatory skin disease affecting the scalp or a relative lack of shampooing. All skin constantly sheds dead skin cells, if one does not remove them, they will accumulate, appearing as white to yellow flakes on one's clothing. Alternatively, an inflammatory skin disease affecting the scalp, such as ""'seborrhea'' ''dermatitis'' (''eczema''), ''psoriasis'', or a fungal infection, can cause rapid growth of skin cells, producing excess scaling so abundant that it is often impossible to remove it even by shampooing frequently.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of dandruff?,"'Dandruff'"" is a sign of a potential scalp problem if it is present in excess. If one neglects washing one's hair, it is perfectly reasonable to expect to see ""'dandruff''. Simple regular shampooing will resolve the problem. On the other hand, if there is an inflammatory disease that is responsible for the production of excessive scaling, then treatment of this underlying problem can control the production of those unsightly flakes of skin. If a disease is present, dandruff is frequently accompanied by ''itching''.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose dandruff?,"'A physical examination of the scalp skin is necessary to determine if a disease is present. Occasionally, a doctor may remove a portion of the scalp skin surgically so a pathologist can examine it to aid the physician in arriving at the correct diagnosis. Dermatologists have the most expertise in correctly diagnosing and treating scalp diseases.' "
What are treatments and medications for dandruff?,"'The most common scalp disease producing excessive dandruff is ''seborrheic dermatitis''. The cause is unclear (it is believed by some to be due to excess growth of the skin yeasts ''Pityrosporum'' or ''Malassezia''), but a disturbance in the balance between normal scalp microbes has been postulated. It is easily controlled with safe, effective topical medications. ''Seborrheic dermatitis'' is characterized by exacerbations and remissions and recurs if treatment is stopped. There is no known cure.''Medicated, anti-dandruff shampoos containing zinc pyrithione, coal tar, salicylic acid, selenium sulfide, or ''ketoconazole'' are effective at controlling seborrheic dermatitis. It is not unusual to supplement these shampoos with a medium potency topical steroid lotion, solution, or foam applied to the scalp once or twice a day. There is little compelling evidence to suggest that either ''tea tree oil'' products (a single Australian study funded by the ''Tea Tree Oil'' Institute in 2002 using a 5% tea tree oil shampoo reduced dandruff in healthy individuals) or apple cider vinegar is of any benefit in controlling dandruff. Since a variety of other skin diseases can affect the scalp, an examination by a physician with special expertise in treating and diagnosing skin diseases is recommended if nonprescription shampoos are ineffective.' "
What is the prognosis for dandruff?,"'If the dandruff is related to the infrequent use of shampoo, it often can be controlled entirely by more frequent washing. If it is due to seborrheic dermatitis, it is easily controlled with a variety of shampoos and the use of topical steroids products. These products do not cure the problem. If treatment is discontinued, the disease will eventually return. They should use effective treatment just frequently enough to control the problem. Excessive use is just a waste of money and will not improve the long-term outlook. Other scalp diseases causing dandruff require more specific treatments.' "
Is it possible to prevent dandruff?,"'The best ''prevention'' is probably to use an anti-dandruff shampoo (medicated shampoo, such as selenium sulfide shampoo) as your regular shampoo frequently and regularly.' "
What should I know about dry skin?," Dry skin is a very common condition that causes small fine flakes, cracking, and dry patches. Itching is one of the most common symptoms of dry skin. Scratching may be hard to resist. Dry skin is more common in colder winter months and drier climates. The elderly are more prone to dry skin than younger people. Dry skin is more common in individuals with a history of eczema. Dry skin may rarely be a side effect of certain medications. Dry skin is more common in those with hypothyroidism. Repeat itch-scratch cycles may lead to skin thickening and darkening. Possible complications include rashes, eczema, and bacterial infections. Extreme dryness can cause the skin to crack, producing fissures. Medications including topical corticosteroids and lubricating lotions and creams can help ease itching. Secondary infections may result from scratches and skin breakdown. Several home remedies, such as decreasing bathing frequency and lubricating the skin with moisturizers after showers, can help control and prevent dry skin."
What is dry skin?,"'Dry skin is a very common skin condition characterized by a lack of the appropriate amount of water in the most superficial layer of the skin, the ''epidermis''. While dry skin tends to affect males and females equally, older individuals are typically much more prone to dry skin. The skin in elderly individuals tends to have diminished amounts of natural skin oils and lubricants. Areas such as the arms, hands, and particularly lower legs tend to be more affected by dry skin. Environmental factors, such as humidity and temperature, have a profound effect on the amount of water retained within the skin. For example, ''cold'', dry air when heated by a furnace will produce dry skin by evaporating moisture on the skin. Frequent hand-washing and sanitizing causes evaporation and dryness. Dry skin may also be a side effect of some medications as well as a byproduct of certain skin diseases.''The ''epidermis'' is normally composed of fat (''lipid'') and protein. The ''lipid'' portion of the epidermis along with specific epidermal proteins (for example, filaggrin) help prevent skin ''dehydration''. When there are deficient proteins and/or ''lipids'', the skin moisture evaporates more easily. As skin becomes dry, it also may become more sensitive and prone to ''rashes'' and skin breakdown. The medical term for dry skin is ''xerosis''. Simple ''prevention'' and treatment measures are very effective in the treatment of dry skin. Basic dry skin ''prevention'' steps include avoidance of harsh soaps and chemical cleansers. Treatment generally requires more frequent and regular applications of bland emollients and moisturizers. Untreated, dry skin may result in complications, including, eczematous ''dermatitis'', secondary ''bacterial infections'', ''cellulitis'', and skin discoloration. Fortunately, dry skin is usually mild and can be easily remedied.' "
What are signs and symptoms of dry skin?,"'The key symptom of dry skin is ''itching''. People who have dry skin can often find rough, dry, red patches on their skin, and these patches are often ''itchy''. Typical skin areas affected include arms, hands, lower legs, abdomen, and areas of friction such as ankles and soles. As skin dryness becomes more severe, cracks and fissures may evolve.''Symptoms and signs:''The ''itchy'' feeling may worsen the severity of dry skin. ''Itching'' can lead to the development of the ""''itch''-scratch"" cycle. That is, as a person feels ''itchy'', he or she scratches in response, which exacerbates the ''itch'', and so on. The ''itch''-scratch cycle is often seen when conscious control of scratching is low or absent, for instance during ''sleep''.''Most common dry skin areas are:''Constantly scratching and rubbing the skin may cause the skin to become thick and leathery. For others, small, red, raised ''bumps'' may appear on their skin, and these bumpy spots can be irritated, opened, and infected if scratched.'   Itching Rough dry skin Red plaques of eczematous skin (nummular eczema) the lower legs, hands, arms."
What causes dry skin?,"'There is no single cause of dry skin. Dry skin causes can be classified as external and internal. External factors are the most common underlying cause and are the easiest to address. External factors include cold temperatures and low humidity, especially during the winter when central heaters are used. Internal factors include overall health, age, genetics, family history, and a personal history of other medical conditions like ''atopic dermatitis''. In particular, those with certain ''thyroid diseases'' are more prone to developing dry skin.''External factors that cause dry skin include:''Although bathing and showering adds water to skin, it is the evaporation of this water after the completion of the immersion that results in dry skin. Skin that feels overly tight after bathing may indicate excess removal of water and natural skin oils.''One of the most common factors causing dry skin is frequent application of harsh soaps. The type of soap may have a large impact on dry skin. Soap is an emulsifier that removes oils on the skin. The more often skin is scrubbed with soap, the more oil is removed, ultimately resulting in drier skin. Excessive use of soaps can worsen dry skin.''Moreover, dry skin may persist or worsen if using moisturizers improperly or choosing an inadequate moisturizer. Sometimes, the material of different clothing can also affect dry skin. Some materials such as wool or synthetic fibers tend to irritate the skin and worsen dry skin.''Dry skin condition may be caused by taking some medicines, as well. Some examples are ''high blood pressure'', ''high cholesterol'', ''allergy'', and ''acne'' medications. Occasionally, a dry skin problem can be a sign of an internal medical condition. For instance, ''aging'' may inherently make people more prone to dry skin. In addition, ''eczema'', ''psoriasis'', ''diabetes'', ''hypothyroidism'', and malnutrition are all associated with dry skin.'   over-washing with harsh soaps, overuse of sanitizers and lipid solvents (alcohol), cold temperature, low humidity."
Does dry skin cause winter itch?,"'Winter itch is a common name for the skin symptom of generalized ''itching'' in the winter. It is primarily caused by dry skin and is most common in the elderly. Winter itch caused by dry skin may also be seen in those with a history of ''eczema''. External factors, including cold temperatures, low humidity, and the use of central heat, tend to worsen dry skin during the winter season. Therefore, some people refer to the condition of dry skin in the winter as ""winter itch.""' "
Do genetics play a role in dry skin?,"'Dry skin may be mimicked by a genetic condition called ichthyosis. There are many types of ichthyosis. ''Ichthyosis vulgaris'' is the most common type, and it is a severe scaly skin condition, often of the front of the lower legs. ''Ichthyosis vulgaris'' causes dry, fishlike scales. This type of ichthyosis tends to run in families. Dry skin is a major manifestation of ''atopic dermatitis'', which has a genetic component.' "
What medical conditions cause dry skin?,"'Certain physiological changes and medical conditions may cause dry skin. The onset of dry skin may be due to ''aging'' or hormonal changes, as seen in menopausal women. In some cases, individuals who have medical conditions such as ''hypothyroidism'', ''diabetes'', or malnutrition (for example, deficiency of ''vitamin A'') may suffer from ''xerosis''.''The following medical conditions may cause dry skin:'   Hypothyroidism Diabetes Malnutrition Atopic dermatitis"
Do any medications cause dry skin?,"'Medications for medical conditions like ''high blood pressure'' (such as diuretics), ''cholesterol''-lowering ''drugs'', and ''acne'' (such as retinoids like ''Retin A'' and ''isotretinoin'') may also dry out the skin.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose dry skin?,"'Generally, dry skin can be easily diagnosed when the physician visually inspects the skin. While dry skin can appear on any type of skin at any age, the elderly and individuals who frequently expose their skin to soaps or detergents are more prone to developing this condition. In addition, a thorough medical history and review of the family history can help support the diagnosis of dry skin. Based on the medical history, other medical conditions may be ruled out or considered. In more difficult cases, a ''skin biopsy'' may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and direct the treatment plan.' "
What is the treatment for dry skin?,"'The best treatment for dry skin is daily lubrication with an emollient (a substance that inhibits the evaporation of water). Because most dry skin is due to external causes, external treatments like creams and lotions can be applied and effectively control the skin problem. Often, dry skin can be improved by applying a bland ''over-the-counter'' moisturizer. Once other causes of dry skin have been ruled out, the main goals of treatments are to stop the itching, prevent ''loss of water'', and restore skin hydration.''Light moisturizing lotions for mild dry skin include:''Highly moisturizing products (that characteristically do not flow out of the jar when inverted) for severe dry skin include:''Topical steroid creams include:''As a general rule, only mild ''corticosteroid'' creams like hydrocortisone should be used on the face, underarm, and groin areas. Long-term application of strong ''corticosteroid'' creams like fluocinonide may cause serious adverse effects, including skin thinning, ''stretch marks'', and skin breakdown.''Oral ''antihistamines'' such as ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl''), ''hydroxyzine'' (''Vistaril'', Atarax), and ''cetirizine'' (''Zyrtec'') may also alleviate generalized itching in dry skin by allowing one to ''sleep'' better at night. They do not have a direct effect on the itching itself.''Anti-itch oral medications include:' Cetaphil lotion Lubriderm lotion Curel lotion Vaseline Aquaphor hydrocortisone 1% cream (mild strength), Pramosone 2.5% cream (mild strength), triamcinolone 0.1% cream (medium strength), fluocinonide 0.05% cream (strong strength). hydroxyzine (Atarax) diphenhydramine (Benadryl)"
What are some home remedies for dry skin?,"'Apply an emollient cream two or three times daily to wet skin.''Dry skin may be improved by taking lukewarm showers or baths and avoiding excess skin scrubbing. Hot water and harsh scrubbing can take away the natural oils that protect skin and make the skin even drier.''Dry skin may be prevented by use of gentle cleansers. Mild cleansers or soap-free products like Aveeno, Cetaphil, Dove, or Neutrogena are recommended for dry and sensitive skin. Many scented, deodorant, and antibacterial soaps can be too harsh and wash off natural skin-protecting oils.''Special moisturizers containing lactic acid (''AmLactin'', ''Lac-Hydrin''), or urea (Urix or Carmol) are also effective in hydrating the skin.''Mild soaps and cleansers include:''Mild moisturizers without perfumes are good for dry skin. Thick and greasy emollients work best. Typically, moisturizers should be applied within three to five minutes of bathing when the skin is still damp.''The moisture on the skin and in the environment is very important to dry skin. Maintaining the skin at optimal hydration and using an indoor humidifier may help improve dry skin.'   Dove soapless cleanser, Aveeno cleanser, Cetaphil cleanser."
What are possible complications of dry skin?,"'An occasional complication of dry skin and itching is secondary bacterial infection. Infections may be mild and resolve spontaneously or may be more severe and necessitate antibiotic treatment. Severe itching leads to repeat scratching of lesions, hence the ""itch-scratch-''rash''-itch"" cycle. Because of the persistence of this itch-scratch cycle, the skin may become much thickened in these areas from rubbing. Repeat skin rubbing in the same area may lead to two localized chronic ''skin conditions'' called ''lichen simplex chronicus'' (LSC) and prurigo nodule.' "
Is it possible to prevent dry skin?,"'To prevent skin from drying out, it may be helpful to humidify the indoor environment especially during the drier, winter months. Sometimes decreasing bathing frequency and avoiding strong soaps, and decreasing exposure to detergents also may help improve dry skin. Harsh cleansers can strip away the natural oils and sebum from the skin. Limiting exposure to irritants such as solvents and wool clothing can prevent the dry skin condition from worsening.' Avoid strong soaps and detergents. Use indoor room humidifiers. Limit exposure to irritants such as solvents. Avoid wool clothing. Use cotton and natural fiber clothing. Move to a super-humid environment like New Orleans, Houston, Bangkok, Hong Kong, or Manila."
What are the best products for dry skin?,"'Top products for dry skin include mild cleansers and rich moisturizers. Non-scented, mild cleansers or soap-free products include Dove, Cetaphil, and Purpose soap. Thick, greasy, moisturizers include Aquaphor, Vaseline, Crisco, and SBR Lipocream.'  "
What is dry socket?,"'The typical scenario for dry socket is the occurrence of throbbing ''pain'' about two to four days after the tooth is extracted. Dry socket ''pain'' is often accompanied by ''bad breath'' and a foul taste in the mouth. With this onset of pain, it is obvious that proper healing has been interrupted.''Dry socket is a condition in which there is inflammation of the jawbone (or alveolar bone) after a tooth extraction. It is also referred to as ""alveolar osteitis"" and is one of the many complications that can occur from a tooth extraction. The occurrence of dry socket is relatively rare, occurring in about 2% of tooth extractions. However, that percentage rises to at least 20% when it involves the removal of mandibular impacted third molars (lower ''wisdom teeth'').' "
What causes dry socket?,"'A dry socket is caused by the partial or total loss of a ''blood clot'' in the tooth socket after a tooth extraction. Normally, after a tooth is extracted, a ''blood clot'' will form as the first step in healing to cover and protect the underlying jawbone. If the blood clot is lost or does not form, the bone is exposed and healing is delayed.''In general, a dry socket is a result of bacterial, chemical, mechanical, and physiologic factors. Below are examples for each:' Bacterial: Preexisting infection that is present in the mouth prior to a dental extraction such as periodontal disease (or periodontitis) can prevent proper formation of a blood clot. Certain oral bacteria can cause the breakdown of the clot. Chemical: Nicotine used by smokers causes a decrease in the blood supply in the mouth. As a result, the blood clot may fail to form at the site of a recent tooth extraction. Mechanical: Sucking through a straw, aggressive rinsing, spitting, or dragging on a cigarette causes dislodgement and loss of the blood clot. Physiologic: Hormones, dense jawbone, or poor blood supply are factors that prevent blood clot formation."
What are risk factors for getting dry socket?,"'Prior to a tooth extraction, risk factors for developing a dry socket include ''smoking'', presence of impacted wisdom tooth, being female, and being above the age of 30.''Smoking'' is a risk factor for developing a dry socket due to the nicotine found in cigarettes. Exposure to nicotine reduces the blood supply available to the healing socket and can prevent the proper formation of a blood clot at the extraction site.''Extraction of impacted third molars (''wisdom teeth'') can be traumatic as some surrounding gum tissue and jawbone may need to be removed or may be adversely affected during surgery. Although the extraction is necessary, the resulting ''trauma'' can increase the chances of dry socket.''Previous infections such as periodontal disease or ''pericoronitis'' at the site of the extraction can predispose an individual to dry socket.''Women have been found to develop a dry socket more so than men. This may be related to hormonal factors such as use of ''oral contraceptives'"" or normal hormonal changes during a woman's cycle.""'Patients older than 30 years of age with impacted third molars have an increased risk of dry socket. With age, the jawbone becomes more dense and has less blood supply available. A dense jawbone increases the risk of a traumatic extraction and less blood supply decreases the chances of blood clot formation and timely healing.' "
What are dry socket symptoms and signs?,'A tell-tale sign is a socket that has a partial or total loss of a blood clot. The jawbone may be visible in the socket and the surrounding tissue may appear gray due to poor healing.''Symptoms of a dry socket include a throbbing steady pain that presents a few days after a tooth extraction. The pain may radiate to other parts of the head such as the ears and eyes on the same side of the face. ''Bad breath'' and a bad taste may also be present due to the accumulation of food debris and bacteria in the socket.'  
How is dry socket diagnosed?,"""Diagnosis of a dry socket is based on history of dental treatment, clinical examination, and the individual's symptoms. Timing of when symptoms begin may be an indicator for a dry socket. During normal healing, the discomfort of an extraction should lessen over time. However, if the pain increases, this is an indication that healing is delayed and could possibly be due to a dry socket. Typically, symptoms for a dry socket develop two to four days after a tooth extraction. Most dry sockets happen within the first week after tooth extraction."" "
What is the treatment for dry socket?,"'Treatment usually involves symptomatic support while the socket heals. Initially, the dentist will gently irrigate to clear the socket of food debris. Next, an analgesic medicated dressing or packing is placed within the socket to cover the exposed bone. This usually provides immediate relief. This dressing may need to be replaced every few days during the healing process. The dressing is often coated with ""dry socket paste,"" which is made up of ingredients with pain-relieving properties, including eugenol (clove oil).''Additionally, medications can be prescribed to manage the pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (such as ''Advil'' or ''Aleve'') or narcotics (such as ''hydrocodone/acetaminophen'' [''Vicodin'']) are often used to relieve pain.'  "
Are there home remedies for dry socket?,"'Home treatment for a dry socket usually involves temporary management of pain until a dental professional can be seen for treatment. Methods to provide some relief include use of ''over-the-counter'' pain medications for ''pain management'', ''cold'' compress, or insulated ice pack on the affected side of face (15 minutes on and 15 minutes off), rinsing with saltwater to remove food debris and use of clove oil (place a one to two drops of clove oil on a clean cotton swab and gently apply to the affected area). Again, these methods are only for temporary relief of pain. Delaying a follow-up visit with the dentist or surgeon could prolong the pain as well as the recovery time.' "
What is the average healing time for dry socket?,"'Average healing time is seven to 10 days, as this is the amount of time it takes for new tissue to grow to cover the exposed socket.'  "
What is the prognosis for dry socket?,"'Prognosis is good as there usually are no long-term consequences. Once the tissue is able to cover the bone, the healing will progress normally.' "
Is it possible to prevent dry socket?,"'The ''prevention'' of developing a dry socket may be influenced by the methods used by the dentist or surgeon performing the tooth extraction. Such preventive methods include (1) placement of a packing at surgery with or without antibiotic (for example, ''tetracycline'') and/or (2) placement of ''sutures'' to protect the blood clot. These details can be discussed with the dentist or surgeon prior to the procedure to determine if these preventive methods would be recommended.''After extraction, there are a few day-to-day activities that should be avoided: ''smoking'', drinking with a straw, and vigorous spitting or rinsing. ''Diet'' should be a soft food ''diet''. The area should be kept as clean as possible with gentle rinsing with an antibacterial solution such as chlorhexidine rinse (''Peridex''). This oral rinse can be prescribed by your surgeon. It is important to follow any special instructions given by the dentist or surgeon in caring for the extraction site at home.''Lastly, recent studies have shown that the incidence of dry socket with women is significantly decreased when tooth extractions are performed during their ''menstrual period'' (menses). When ''teeth'' extractions can be electively planned, the recommendation is to perform this procedure during the menstrual period. In this way, the risk of dry socket due to cycle-related hormonal changes can be eliminated.' "
Facts you should know about vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy," Vaginal atrophy is the medical term that refers to the thinning of the wall of the vagina that occurs during the menopause (the time after menstrual periods have ceased) in women. Vaginal atrophy occurs due to falling estrogen levels. Vaginal atrophy may be associated with vaginal dryness, itching, irritation, and/or pain during sexual intercourse. Hormone therapy can be effective in treating vaginal atrophy and other menopausal symptoms, but hormone therapy carries its own risks. Local vaginal hormone creams or vaginal lubricants are alternatives to systemic hormone therapy."
What causes vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"'Vaginal atrophy is the medical term that refers to the thinning of the wall of the vagina that occurs during ''menopause'' (the time when menstrual periods have ceased) in women. Prior to ''menopause'', the vaginal lining appears plump, bright red, and moist. As estrogen levels decline, the lining of the vagina becomes thinner, drier, light pink to bluish in color, and less elastic. This is a normal change that is noticed by many perimenopausal and ''postmenopausal'' women.''Estrogen levels begin to fall as the ''menopause'' approaches. ''Estrogens'' are mainly produced by the ovaries. ''Estrogens'' control the development of female body characteristics such as the breasts, body shape, and body hair. Estrogens also play a significant role in the regulation of the ''menstrual cycle'' and ''pregnancy''.''Most women reach ''menopause'' between the ages of 45 and 55, but it can occur earlier or later in life. The ''menopause'' average age is 51 years old. Every woman is different, and there is no definitive way to predict when an individual woman will enter menopause. Also, women in the menopausal transition experience symptoms with varying degrees of severity. Not all perimenopausal and ''postmenopausal'' women will have the same symptoms or experience the same levels of severity.'  "
What symptoms can be associated with vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"'Other vaginal symptoms that are commonly associated with vaginal atrophy include ''vaginal dryness'', ''itching'', irritation, and/or ''pain'' with sexual intercourse (known as dyspareunia). The vaginal changes also lead to an increased risk of vaginal infections.''In addition to the vaginal symptoms, women may experience other symptoms of the menopausal transition. ''Hot flashes'', ''night sweats'', ''mood changes'', ''fatigue'',  ''urinary tract infections'', ''urinary incontinence'', ''acne'', memory problems, and unwanted hair growth. '  "
How do medical professionals diagnose vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"'Vaginal symptoms such as ''itching'', dryness, or ''pain'' with sexual intercourse are\xa0typically sufficient to assume that a woman is suffering from vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy if she is experiencing other symptoms consistent with the menopausal transition. Of course, a careful physical examination, including a pelvic examination, is necessary to rule out other conditions (such as infections) that may be causing vaginal symptoms.''There are no specific tests available to determine whether the vaginal wall has become thinner or less elastic.' "
What treatments are available for vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"'Vaginal dryness and atrophy do not need to be treated unless they cause symptoms or discomfort. Women who experience symptoms have several treatment options.''Hormone therapy (HT) is effective in treating vaginal dryness/vaginal atrophy. HT has also been referred to as ''hormone replacement therapy'' (''HRT'') or postmenopausal hormone therapy (PHT). HT has been shown to effectively reduce vaginal dryness as well as help control ''hot flashes'' associated with menopause.''However, HT is not without its risks. Long-term studies (the NIH-sponsored '""Women's Health""' Initiative, or WHI) of women who took oral combined hormone therapy containing both estrogen and ''progesterone'' showed that these women had an increased risk for ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''breast cancer'' when compared with women who did not receive it.''Women taking oral estrogen alone had an increased risk for ''stroke'', but not for ''heart attack'' or ''breast cancer''. Estrogen therapy alone, however, is associated with an increased risk of developing ''endometrial cancer'' (''cancer'' of the lining of the uterus) in postmenopausal women who have not had their uterus surgically removed.''HT may be administered in pill form or transdermally (patches or sprays from which the medication is absorbed through the skin). Transdermal\xa0estrogens enter the circulation directly, where oral estrogen products must first pass through the ''liver'' from the stomach. Since transdermal hormone products do not have effects on the ''liver'', this route of administration has become the preferred form for most women. A number of preparations are available for oral and transdermal forms of HT, varying in the both type and amount of hormones in the products.''So-called ""bioidentical"" hormone therapy for perimenopausal women has been a source of much attention in recent years. Bioidentical hormone preparations are hormones with the same chemical formula as those made naturally in the body but which are produced in a laboratory by altering compounds derived from naturally-occurring plant products. While some of these preparations are U.S. FDA-approved and manufactured by drug companies, others are made at special pharmacies called compounding pharmacies, which make the preparations on a case-by-case basis for each patient. Since individually compounded products cannot be standardized, these individual preparations are not regulated by the FDA. There is no evidence that bioidentical preparations provide superior symptom relief. Studies to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of these products have not yet been carried out.'""No matter what form of therapy is used, the decision about hormone therapy should take into account the inherent risks and benefits of the treatment along with each woman's own medical history and the severity of her symptoms. Current recommendations state that if hormone therapy is used, it should be used at the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible time.""'There are also local, topical (meaning applied directly to the vagina) low-dose hormonal treatments for the symptoms of vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy. Local treatments include the vaginal estrogen ring, vaginal estrogen cream, or vaginal estrogen tablets. Local (vaginal) estrogen treatments can be very effective in reducing vaginal dryness while having a minimal effect on other tissues in the body.''There is also now a product for vaginal dryness that consists of a daily pill which contains a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). These are theoretically safer than estrogens and can be alternative for some patients.''Vaginal moisturizing agents such as creams or lotions (for example, K-Y Silk-E Vaginal Moisturizer or KY Liquibeads Vaginal Moisturizer) as well as the use of lubricants during sexual intercourse are non-hormonal options for managing the discomfort of vaginal dryness. A longer acting moisturizer called Replens is also available over the counter.''Applying Betadine topically on the outer vaginal area, and soaking in a sitz bath or soaking in a bathtub of warm water may be helpful for relieving symptoms of burning and ''vaginal pain'' after intercourse.'  "
What is the prognosis for vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy?,"""Vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy are common complaints in postmenopausal women. While these conditions do not produce serious consequences, they are a source of significant discomfort for many women. Hormone treatments are available that are very effective in reducing vaginal dryness, but whether or not to use hormone therapy is an individual decision that must consider the inherent risks and benefits of the treatment along with each woman's own medical history. Women with only mild symptoms may experience relief by using vaginal moisturizing agents and/or lubricants during sexual intercourse."" "
What is osteoporosis?,"'Osteoporosis is a medical condition that is characterized by bones that are less dense than, and thus not as strong as, normal bone. Osteoporosis increases the risk of breaking a bone (fracture) with even minor ''trauma'', such as a fall from standing height, or even from a ''cough'' or sneeze. Unfortunately, people often do not realize they have osteoporosis until either they have a fracture or have a screening test ordered by their doctor to check for osteoporosis. Osteoporosis and low bone mass affect an estimated 44 million Americans. Of those, 10 million have osteoporosis, and the remaining 34 million have a lower than normal bone mass (medically termed ''osteopenia'') and are at higher risk of developing osteoporosis. Women are four times more likely to develop osteoporosis than men. Other health risk factors include older age, family history of osteoporosis, small and thin stature, inactive lifestyle, ''smoking'', ''alcohol'', and use of certain medications, including steroids.' "
How does osteoporosis occur?,"'In order to understand the role of bone mineral density scanning, it is important to know about how osteoporosis occurs. Bone is a living tissue and is constantly being remodeled. This is the natural, healthy state of continuous uptake of old bone (resorption) followed by the deposit of new bone. This turnover is important in keeping bones healthy and in repairing any minor damage that may occur with wear and tear. The cells that lay new bone down are called osteoblasts, and the cells responsible for resorption of old bone are called osteoclasts. Osteoporosis occurs as a result of a mismatch between osteoclast and osteoblast activity. This mismatch can be caused by many different disease states or hormonal changes. It is also commonly a result of ''aging'', change in normal hormones as occurs after ''menopause'', and with diets low in calcium and ''vitamin D''. In osteoporosis, osteoclasts outperform osteoblasts so that more bone is taken up than is laid down. The result is a thinning of the bone with an accompanying loss in bone strength and a greater risk of fracture. A thinning bone results in a lower bone density or bone mass.''There are two major types of bone. Cancellous bone (also known as trabecular bone) is the inner, softer portion of the bone, and cortical bone is the outer, harder layer of bone. Cancellous bone undergoes turnover at a faster rate than cortical bone. As a result, if osteoclast and osteoblast activity become mismatched, cancellous bone is affected more rapidly than cortical bone. Certain areas in the body have a higher ratio of cancellous bone to cortical bone such as the spine (vertebrae), the wrist (distal radius), and the hips (femoral neck).'""Most of a person's bone mass is achieved by early adulthood. After that time, the bone mass gradually declines throughout the rest of a person's life. There is a normal rate of decline in bone mass with age in both men and women. For women, in addition to age, the ""'menopause transition'' itself causes an extra degree of bone loss. This bone loss is greatest in the first three to six years after ''menopause''. Women can lose up to 20% of the total bone mass during this time. Since women generally have a lower bone mass to begin with in comparison with men, the ultimate result is a higher risk of fracture in postmenopausal women as compared to men of the same age. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that men may also be at risk for osteoporosis, especially if they have certain illnesses, a ''low testosterone'' level, are ''smokers'', take certain medications, or are sedentary. The best method to prevent osteoporosis is to achieve as high a bone mass by early adulthood with a proper ''diet'' and regular ''exercise'"". Unfortunately, osteoporosis is not often considered during this time in a person's life."" "
What is bone mineral density (BMD)?,"'The absolute amount of bone as measured by bone mineral density (BMD) testing generally correlates with bone strength and its ability to bear weight. The BMD is measured with a dual energy low-dose X-ray absorptiometry test (referred to as a DXA scan). By measuring BMD, it is possible to predict fracture risk in the same manner that measuring blood pressure can help predict the risk of ''stroke''.''It is important to remember that BMD testing cannot predict the certainty of developing a fracture. It can only predict risk. It is also important to note that a bone density scan, or test, should not be confused with a ''bone scan'', which is a nuclear medicine test in which a radioactive tracer is injected that is used to detect tumors, ''cancer'', ''fractures'', and infections in the bone.'""The World Health Organization has developed definitions for low bone mass (osteopenia) and osteoporosis. These definitions are based on a T-score. The T-score is a measure of how dense a patient's bone is compared to a normal, healthy 30-year-old adult.""'Normal'': A bone BMD is considered normal if the T-score is within 1 standard deviation of the normal young adult value. Thus a T-score between 0 and -1 is considered a normal result. A T-score below -1 is considered an abnormal result.''Low bone mass (medically termed osteopenia)'': A BMD defines osteopenia as a T-score between -1 and -2.5. This signifies an increased fracture risk but does not meet the criteria for osteoporosis.''Osteoporosis'': A BMD more than 2.5 standard deviations from the normal (T score less than or equal to -2.5) defines osteoporosis.''Based on the above medical criteria, it is estimated that 40% of all postmenopausal Caucasian women have osteopenia and that an additional 7% have osteoporosis.' "
Who invented the bone density scan?,"'The bone density scan was invented by the late John R. Cameron (1922-2005), professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. He earned a PhD in physics. He invented bone densitometry in the late 1960s. Bone densitometry, which uses precise, very small ''radiation'' measurements to determine the mineral content of bone, was one of his many important contributions to medical physics.' "
Who performs bone density scans?,"'Bone density scans, or DXA scans, are performed by a trained technician using a DXA machine. The results are then interpreted by a physician. Many different specialist interpret bone density scans, including radiologists, endocrinologists, ''rheumatologists'', gynecologists, and internists.' "
Where is a bone density test done?,"""Bone density tests can be done in a physician's office or in a radiology center in or out of the hospital where other tests such as mammograms, ""'CT scans'', and ''X-rays'' are performed.' "
What information is on a DXA report?,"'There is some variation in DXA reports depending on the facility performing the test. All reports should include the following:' The date of the test, location, and medical equipment used for the test (manufacturer and model of the densitometer) The reason the test was performed The overall diagnosis (normal bone density, osteopenia, or osteoporosis) based on the results of the scan It should mention the results of the test at each site tested. The hip and lumbar spine are always tested. Many medical facilities also measure bone density at the forearm. The bone density is usually reported with three different numbers. First, the actual bone density is reported. This is measured in grams per centimeter squared (g/cm2). Because the exact bone density varies based on the manufacturer and model of the densitometer, the bone density is also reported as a T-score and a Z-score. The T-score is a measure of how dense a patient's bone is compared to a normal, healthy 30-year-old adult. The Z-score is a measure of how dense a patient's bone is compared to the average person of the same age and gender. Comparison of the bone density to any prior tests performed at the same medical facility Many reports include a calculation estimate of the patient's risk of bone fracture based on the results of the bone density scan. This is reported as the risk over the following 10 years of breaking a bone. Some reports also include a vertebral fracture assessment, which uses the DXA to see if there are any bones in the spine that have already fractured. A notation suggesting how long before a follow-up test is needed"
Why is bone mineral density measurement important?,"""Determining a person's BMD helps a health care professional decide if a person is at increased risk for osteoporosis-related fracture. The purpose of BMD testing is to help predict the risk of future fracture so that the treatment program can be optimized. The information from a BMD is used to aid a decision as to whether nonprescription and/or prescription medicine therapy is needed to help reduce the risk of fracture. Additionally, if a patient has a fracture or is planning orthopedic surgery, a diagnosis of osteoporosis might affect the surgical plan. A fracture that could potentially heal in a cast with normal bone mass might require either a longer period of casting or even surgery if the patient has osteoporosis. Sometimes spinal surgeons treat patients with low bone density with bone building medication prior to surgery in order to improve the surgical outcome of bone that is operated on."" "
What is the relationship between BMD and fracture risk?,"'In patients with low bone mass at the hip or the spine (the two areas traditionally measured with DXA [formerly referred to as DEXA] scanning), there is a two- to threefold increase in the incidence of any osteoporotic fracture. In other words, low bone density at the measured areas of the spine and hip can even predict future osteoporotic fractures at other parts of the body besides the spine and hip. In subjects with a BMD in the osteoporosis range, there is approximately a five times increase in the occurrence of osteoporotic fractures.' "
Who should have BMD testing?,"'BMD testing is recommended for all women over the age of 65. Additionally, postmenopausal women under 65 years who have risk factors for osteoporosis other than ''menopause'' (these include a previous history of fractures, low body weight, ''cigarette smoking'', and a family history of fractures) should be tested. Finally, men or women with strong risk factors as listed below should discuss the benefit of DXA scanning with their health care professional to see if testing is indicated.''The following are potential risk factors for osteoporosis that might suggest the need for DXA scanning:' Personal history of fracture as an adult History of fracture in first-degree relative Low body weight or thin body stature Advanced age Current cigarette smoking Use of corticosteroid therapy for more than three months Impaired vision Estrogen deficiency at early age Dementia Poor health/frailty Recent falls Lifelong low calcium intake Low physical activity Alcohol intake of more than two drinks/day Thyroid disease Rheumatoid arthritis Excessive caffeine consumption Use of oral contraceptive (birth control pills)"
How is BMD measured?,"""Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, or DXA, is the most common method to measure a patient's BMD. DXA, or densitometry, is relatively easy to perform and the amount of radiation exposure is low. A DXA scanner is a machine that produces two X-ray beams, each with different energy levels. One beam is high energy while the other is low energy. The amount of X-rays that pass through the bone is measured for each beam. This will vary depending on the thickness of the bone. Based on the difference between the two X-ray beams, the bone density can be measured. The radiation exposure from a DXA scan is actually much less than that from a traditional ""'chest X-ray''.''At present, DXA scanning gives information on the BMD two main areas, the hip and spine. Another bone that is often evaluated is the bone of the forearm. Although osteoporosis involves the whole body, measurements of BMD at one site can be predictive of fractures at other sites. Scanning generally takes 10 to 20 minutes to complete and is painless. The patient needs to be able to lie still on the table during the testing. There is no IV or other injection needed for this test. In preparation for a DXA, on the day of the test, you may eat a normal meal, but you should not take any ''calcium supplements'' for 24 hours prior to the test.''Certain conditions can alter the results of the DXA scan, making result less reliable. These include a lumbar spinal deformity (''scoliosis''), extensive ''degenerative arthritis'', a large amount of calcium in the blood vessels (''atherosclerosis''), or multiple fractures. These conditions can falsely elevate the measured BMD with the DXA scan.' "
What are other methods of measuring BMD?,"'There are small DXA scanners called peripheral DXA machines. These machines often measure BMD at the heel (calcaneus), shin bone (distal tibia), or kneecap (''patella''). Regular DXA machines have a standard reference (called NHANES III) that can be used for all machines, no matter the manufacturer. However, peripheral DXA machines do not yet have a uniform reference standard for the normal peak young adult bone mass that can apply to all machines and all manufacturers. This is necessary for peripheral DXA to be ready for more widespread use. Efforts are in progress to make the peripheral DXA technique more standardized. At present, it is best used as a screening test to consider whether or not a patient would benefit from further bone density testing.''Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) can be used to assess BMD. A standard CT scanner is used in this method. However, the amount of radiation exposure is higher than with DXA and the cost is greater. For these reasons, QCT is not in general clinical use.''Ultrasound'"" is a relatively new diagnostic tool to measure BMD. There is no radiation source with this procedure. An ultrasound beam is directed at the area being analyzed. The scattering and absorption of the waves allow for an assessment of bone density. The results are not as precise as with the other methods mentioned. This technique is relatively new, and there is considerable research being conducted in this area. Since ultrasounds can easily be performed in a physician's office, this method may become valuable for screening larger populations if its accuracy becomes more refined. If the BMD is low on the ultrasound test, you might be asked to have a DXA scan to confirm the results.""'New techniques that are being developed to measure both the BMD and even the quality of the bone are micro CT and MR, which use technologies related to CT and ''MRI'' scans. These are not yet available for clinical use.' "
How often should DXA scans be repeated to monitor treatment?,"'The frequency of monitoring osteoporosis treatment using DXA scans is highly controversial. Some health care professionals recommend DXA scanning at one- to two-year intervals to monitor changes in bone density during treatment. But recent scientific evidence questions the usefulness of such interval monitoring. Reasons why repeating bone density scans is extremely tricky include:' Bone density changes so slowly that the changes may be smaller than the measurement error of the machine. In other words, repeat DXA scans cannot distinguish between a ""real"" increase in bone density or a mere variation in measurement from the machine itself. Typically, BMD changes 1% per year, which is less than the error of a DXA machine (usually in the range of 3%). Changes of less than 2%-4% in the vertebrae and 3%-6% at the hip from test to test can be due to the precision error of the method. Whereas the real purpose of prescription osteoporosis treatment is to decrease future bone fractures, there is no good correlation between increases in bone density as measured by DXA with decreases in fracture risks with treatment. There are multiple examples of this in recent clinical studies. For example, the improvement in BMD only accounted for 4% of the reduction in spine fracture risk with raloxifene (Evista), 16% of the reduction in spine fracture risk with alendronate (Fosamax), and 18% of the reduction in spine fracture risk with risedronate (Actonel, Atelvia). Thus, improvement in BMD does not indicate the amount of the antifracture benefit of osteoporosis medication. Prescription medication may decrease a person's risk of fracture even when there is no apparent increase in BMD. Physicians and nonphysicians alike are often surprised to learn this information! Even if the DXA scan shows continued deterioration in bone density during treatment, no research data exists demonstrating that changing a medication, combining medications, or increasing medication doses will be safe and helpful in decreasing the future risk of fractures compared to just continuing the same medication. Even if a person's bone density deteriorates during treatment, it is quite likely that the person would have lost even more bone density without treatment. Recent research has shown that women who lose bone density after the first year of menopausal hormone therapy will gain bone density in the next two years, whereas women who gain in the first year will tend to lose density in the next two years of therapy. Therefore, bone density during treatment naturally fluctuates and may not be indicative of the fracture protection of the medication."
What is the cost of DXA?,"'The cost for DXA scanning varies depending on insurance policies and coverage. In general, a patient without health care coverage paying cash can expect to pay approximately $200-$300 U.S. for the procedure.' "
What about the accuracy of BMD testing in the doctor's office using smaller equipment?,"""There are several devices that are smaller than the standard DXA scanners that are being used in health care professional's offices to screen for low bone density. Very little scientific data is available about these smaller units. Most of the information comes directly from the equipment manufacturers themselves. Many of these models test peripheral bones in the ""'feet'' or hands. Other units use ''ultrasonography''. These techniques can be less accurate than BMD testing performed with state of the art equipment. Additionally, office-testing equipment can range dramatically in price and quality.''In general, these devices may be reasonable to measure overall fracture risk but are not useful in monitoring therapy. Their use might be limited to screening and results would require confirmation using DXA. In addition, expertise in using the equipment and interpreting the data can vary. At present, it is difficult to comment on these other methods of BMD testing. Interpretation of the results of these tests may be more difficult and not as reliable as the standard DXA scan. Some doctors use these as screening tools and recommend more formal DXA testing if they are abnormal.' "
Summary,"'Osteoporosis is a disease that results in a significant risk of fracture. The consequences of fracture can include hospitalization, immobility, a decrease in the quality of life, and even death.''From a larger perspective, it is a costly disease in terms of the health-care system and time lost from work. Early detection and therapy is the mainstay for trying to prevent these complications. BMD testing results correlate well with the risk of fracture, and the testing is easily performed in a time-efficient manner without any discomfort. Although many methods of BMD testing exist, the best currently is DXA scanning. It is imperative that testing ultimately be done using state-of-the-art equipment with capable highly trained personnel and a doctor well ''versed'' in interpreting the results.' "
What is the definition of duck syndrome?,"'Duck syndrome, also referred to as the Stanford duck syndrome or ugly duckling syndrome, is not formally recognized as a mental illness but refers to a phenomenon that has primarily been described in college students. Specifically, it is thought to afflict students who are overly invested in looking like they have it all together, and like a duck, appear to be calm and placid on a superficial level but are paddling frantically to ""stay above water"" in terms of meeting the academic, social, and community demands of getting a college education or beyond. Duck syndrome seems to be one way that depression, anxiety, or the initial stages of many mental illnesses can appear (manifest), usually in reaction to ''stress''. Due to the known potentially devastating consequences of depression or anxiety, duck syndrome should be taken quite seriously and aggressively treated.' "
What are causes and risk factors for duck syndrome?,"'Specific risk factors for duck syndrome are thought to include many aspects of the college experience, including living away from family for the first time, a significant increase in academic and extracurricular demands compared to high school, as well as the social pressure associated with attending college. Additional theories about potential risk factors and causes of duck syndrome include the pressure that social media can place on young adults to appear to be achieving effortless perfection as a student despite all of the pressures thereof. Family risk factors that are thought to be specific for duck syndrome include a tendency to be demanding and highly competitive, placing high value on perfection, and parents who are overly protective of children such that the children have minimal experience with disappointment, resilience, and at accepting their challenges as well as their strengths. Such a ''parenting'"" style is sometimes referred to as helicopter parenting, in that the parents tend to hover and excessively intervene in their children's lives.""'Given the likely relationship between duck syndrome and mental illnesses, particularly with depression and anxiety, the risk factors for those conditions should be considered to be predisposing factors for duck syndrome, as well. Like most emotional conditions, the depression and/or anxiety associated with duck syndrome does not tend to have one specific cause. Rather, people with this condition usually have a number of biological, psychological, and environmental contributors to its development. Biologically, depression, anxiety, and therefore perhaps duck syndrome can be associated with abnormal levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, a smaller size of some areas of the brain, and increased activity in other parts of the brain. Girls and women are more likely to be given a diagnosis of depression and many anxiety disorders compared to boys and men, but that is thought to be due to, among other things, biological differences based on gender and differences in how females are encouraged to interpret their experiences and respond to them compared to males. There is thought to be at least a partially genetic component, and people with a ''depressed'' or anxious parent are more likely to also develop the disorders. These issues are therefore likely to pertain to the development of duck syndrome.''As with the previously described contributors to the development of duck syndrome, psychological contributors to depression and anxiety include perfectionism, low self-esteem, negative ''body image'', being excessively self-critical, and often feeling helpless when dealing with negative events. People who suffer from conduct disorder, ''attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'') or who have cognitive or learning problems, as well as trouble engaging in social activities also are have more risk of developing depression and anxiety so should be considered at potentially higher risk for developing duck syndrome.''Like other manifestations of depression and anxiety, duck syndrome may be a reaction to life stresses that predispose a person to developing any mental illness. Examples of such risk factors may include ''trauma'', like being the victim of verbal, physical, or sexual abuse; exposure to ''domestic violence'', the death of a loved one, school problems, being bullied, or being exposed to peer pressure. In addition to the more specific risk factors for depression and anxiety previously described, other potential contributors to this condition include poverty, exposure to community violence, social isolation, parental conflicts, divorce, and other causes of family disruptions. Children who have limited physical activity, poor school performance, or lose a relationship are at higher risk for developing depression, anxiety, and therefore to developing duck syndrome, as well.' "
What are duck syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'Due to the informality of this diagnosis, there are no formal diagnostic criteria associated with duck syndrome. However, symptoms that have often been described include appearing placid on a superficial level (""above water"") while frantically yet covertly (""underwater"") failing in one\'s attempts to keep up with the real or imagined excessive demands (to keep from ""''drowning''""). Other often-described symptoms associated with duck syndrome include feeling that everyone else is doing, feeling, or being well compared to oneself, or that others are scrutinizing or perhaps even designing the situation to test their performance.' "
How do health-care professionals diagnose duck syndrome?,"'Since duck syndrome is not a formal diagnosis, it is the underlying depression, anxiety, and any other mental health problem that would be assessed.''Depression or anxiety are associated with a number of other mental-health conditions, like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (''ADHD''), ''bipolar disorder'', ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), and thought disorders like ''schizophrenia'', so the evaluator will likely screen for signs and symptoms of manic depression (''bipolar disorder''), a history of trauma, and other mental-health symptoms. The depression or anxiety that is usually associated with duck syndrome also may be associated with a number of medical problems, or it can be a side effect of various medications, exposure to ''drugs'' of abuse, or other toxic substances. Therefore, routine laboratory tests are often done during the initial assessment to rule out other causes of symptoms. Sometimes, an X-ray, scan, or another imaging test may be needed. As part of the evaluation, the sufferer may be asked a series of questions from a standardized symptom survey or self-test to help determine the risk of ''suicide''.' "
What types of specialists treat duck syndrome?,"'A number of mental-health practitioners tend to evaluate an individual who is thought to have duck syndrome. Such professionals include licensed mental-health counselors, pediatricians, other primary-care providers, specialists who treat patients for a medical problem, emergency-department doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and social workers. These professionals will likely perform or refer for a thorough medical evaluation as part of assigning the correct diagnosis.' "
What is treatment for duck syndrome?,"'Treatment for duck syndrome may include alleviating any medical condition that causes or worsens the associated depression, anxiety, or other mental illness. For example, a person who is found to have largely fluctuating ''blood sugar'' levels might receive medication to keep their blood sugar levels stable. Other aspects of treatment may include supportive therapy, like lifestyle and behavioral changes, psychotherapy, and possibly medication for moderate to severe emotional symptoms. If symptoms are severe enough that treatment with medication is appropriate, the individual will likely improve faster, more robustly, and for longer when medication is combined with psychotherapy.''Psychotherapy (""talk therapy"") is a kind of mental health counseling that entails working with a trained therapist to figure out ways to solve problems and cope with depression. It can be a powerfully effective intervention, even resulting in positive biochemical changes in the brain. Two major kinds of psychotherapy are commonly used to treat depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions and are therefore likely an effective intervention for duck syndrome: interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. In general, these forms of treatment take weeks to months to complete and have a goal of alleviating depressive or anxiety symptoms. More intensive psychotherapy may be needed for longer when treating very severe mental-health symptoms.''Interpersonal therapy (IPT): This form of psychotherapy seeks to alleviate depressive or anxiety symptoms associated with duck syndrome by helping the sufferer develop more effective skills for coping with their emotions and relationships. IPT uses two strategies to achieve those goals:''Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): This approach to psychotherapy can help decrease the depression or anxiety that often presents as duck syndrome and the likelihood it will come back by helping a duck syndrome sufferer change his or her way of thinking about certain issues. In CBT, the therapist uses three techniques to achieve these goals.''The most commonly used group of ''antidepressant''/antianxiety medications prescribed is the selective ''serotonin'' reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRI medications influence the levels of serotonin in the brain. For many prescribing practitioners, these medications are the first choice because of the significant degree of effectiveness and safety of this group of medicines.''Other antidepressant/antianxiety medications work differently than the commonly used SSRIs. The following medications might be prescribed when SSRIs have not worked: ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin''), ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), or ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''). Older antidepressant/antianxiety medications that are sometimes considered when others are ineffective include ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil''), ''imipramine'' (''Tofranil''), or ''maprotiline'' (''Ludiomil''), but these require more intensive medical monitoring and are more prone to causing side effects than the medications previously described.'  Educating the person about the nature of their emotional symptoms: The therapist will reassure the sufferer that stress is a common phenomenon and that most people tend to improve with treatment. Defining problems (such low self confidence or relationship problems): Once problems are defined, the therapist can help the individual set realistic goals for solving these problems and work with him or her using different treatment techniques to reach these goals. Didactic component: This phase helps to establish positive expectations for treatment and promote the person's investment in the treatment process. Cognitive component: This encourages understanding the thoughts and assumptions that play a role in the individual's behaviors, especially those that may predispose the sufferer to be depressed, anxious, or otherwise stressed. Behavioral component: This uses behavior-modification techniques to teach the duck syndrome sufferer healthier, more effective ways of coping with problems."
What are complications of duck syndrome?,"'Without treatment, symptoms of anxiety, depression, most other mental illnesses tend to last much longer, may not improve, or may worsen. Given the association of duck syndrome with emotional problems, that is likely true of that phenomenon as well. With treatment, the chances of recovery are therefore likely significantly improved.''Depression and anxiety put sufferers at risk for developing a number of other mental-health issues. For example, individuals with either of those issues are also more likely to have poor academic or job performance, to engage in ''substance abuse'', and to experience family and other relationship problems.' "
What is the prognosis for duck syndrome?,"'Since duck syndrome is often a manifestation of depression or anxiety, the outcomes for those conditions need to be considered. Depression can be chronic, in that 85% of people who have one episode of the disorder will have another one within 15 years of the first episode. People with depression or anxiety are at greater risk for developing other forms of mental illness, disability, or even death.' "
Is it possible to prevent duck syndrome?,"'Ways to prevent stress and the effects thereof, including duck syndrome in college students, are thought to include a robust orientation for new students regarding ''stress management'' and mental health services; highly available peer outreach groups; increased attention for students who may be at higher risk for isolation (for example, those who are the first to attend college in their families, may not be involved with any organized activity through their college, or be a minority based on gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other basis); supportive relationships between college students and their dormitory staff; well-implemented procedures for helping students who are in crisis; and the availability of comprehensive mental-health services. Academic supports, including regular academic counseling and academic mentoring, as well as tutoring services are also potential ways to prevent the development of duck syndrome.' "

What is the definition of duck syndrome?,"'Duck syndrome, also referred to as the Stanford duck syndrome or ugly duckling syndrome, is not formally recognized as a mental illness but refers to a phenomenon that has primarily been described in college students. Specifically, it is thought to afflict students who are overly invested in looking like they have it all together, and like a duck, appear to be calm and placid on a superficial level but are paddling frantically to ""stay above water"" in terms of meeting the academic, social, and community demands of getting a college education or beyond. Duck syndrome seems to be one way that depression, anxiety, or the initial stages of many mental illnesses can appear (manifest), usually in reaction to ''stress''. Due to the known potentially devastating consequences of depression or anxiety, duck syndrome should be taken quite seriously and aggressively treated.' "
What are causes and risk factors for duck syndrome?,"'Specific risk factors for duck syndrome are thought to include many aspects of the college experience, including living away from family for the first time, a significant increase in academic and extracurricular demands compared to high school, as well as the social pressure associated with attending college. Additional theories about potential risk factors and causes of duck syndrome include the pressure that social media can place on young adults to appear to be achieving effortless perfection as a student despite all of the pressures thereof. Family risk factors that are thought to be specific for duck syndrome include a tendency to be demanding and highly competitive, placing high value on perfection, and parents who are overly protective of children such that the children have minimal experience with disappointment, resilience, and at accepting their challenges as well as their strengths. Such a ''parenting'"" style is sometimes referred to as helicopter parenting, in that the parents tend to hover and excessively intervene in their children's lives.""'Given the likely relationship between duck syndrome and mental illnesses, particularly with depression and anxiety, the risk factors for those conditions should be considered to be predisposing factors for duck syndrome, as well. Like most emotional conditions, the depression and/or anxiety associated with duck syndrome does not tend to have one specific cause. Rather, people with this condition usually have a number of biological, psychological, and environmental contributors to its development. Biologically, depression, anxiety, and therefore perhaps duck syndrome can be associated with abnormal levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, a smaller size of some areas of the brain, and increased activity in other parts of the brain. Girls and women are more likely to be given a diagnosis of depression and many anxiety disorders compared to boys and men, but that is thought to be due to, among other things, biological differences based on gender and differences in how females are encouraged to interpret their experiences and respond to them compared to males. There is thought to be at least a partially genetic component, and people with a ''depressed'' or anxious parent are more likely to also develop the disorders. These issues are therefore likely to pertain to the development of duck syndrome.''As with the previously described contributors to the development of duck syndrome, psychological contributors to depression and anxiety include perfectionism, low self-esteem, negative ''body image'', being excessively self-critical, and often feeling helpless when dealing with negative events. People who suffer from conduct disorder, ''attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'') or who have cognitive or learning problems, as well as trouble engaging in social activities also are have more risk of developing depression and anxiety so should be considered at potentially higher risk for developing duck syndrome.''Like other manifestations of depression and anxiety, duck syndrome may be a reaction to life stresses that predispose a person to developing any mental illness. Examples of such risk factors may include ''trauma'', like being the victim of verbal, physical, or sexual abuse; exposure to ''domestic violence'', the death of a loved one, school problems, being bullied, or being exposed to peer pressure. In addition to the more specific risk factors for depression and anxiety previously described, other potential contributors to this condition include poverty, exposure to community violence, social isolation, parental conflicts, divorce, and other causes of family disruptions. Children who have limited physical activity, poor school performance, or lose a relationship are at higher risk for developing depression, anxiety, and therefore to developing duck syndrome, as well.' "
What are duck syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'Due to the informality of this diagnosis, there are no formal diagnostic criteria associated with duck syndrome. However, symptoms that have often been described include appearing placid on a superficial level (""above water"") while frantically yet covertly (""underwater"") failing in one\'s attempts to keep up with the real or imagined excessive demands (to keep from ""''drowning''""). Other often-described symptoms associated with duck syndrome include feeling that everyone else is doing, feeling, or being well compared to oneself, or that others are scrutinizing or perhaps even designing the situation to test their performance.' "
How do health-care professionals diagnose duck syndrome?,"'Since duck syndrome is not a formal diagnosis, it is the underlying depression, anxiety, and any other mental health problem that would be assessed.''Depression or anxiety are associated with a number of other mental-health conditions, like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (''ADHD''), ''bipolar disorder'', ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), and thought disorders like ''schizophrenia'', so the evaluator will likely screen for signs and symptoms of manic depression (''bipolar disorder''), a history of trauma, and other mental-health symptoms. The depression or anxiety that is usually associated with duck syndrome also may be associated with a number of medical problems, or it can be a side effect of various medications, exposure to ''drugs'' of abuse, or other toxic substances. Therefore, routine laboratory tests are often done during the initial assessment to rule out other causes of symptoms. Sometimes, an X-ray, scan, or another imaging test may be needed. As part of the evaluation, the sufferer may be asked a series of questions from a standardized symptom survey or self-test to help determine the risk of ''suicide''.' "

What is duodenal biliary drainage?,'Duodenal biliary drainage is a little-used procedure that sometimes can be helpful in diagnosing ''gallstones''. This rare procedure has been out of common use since the late 1940s.' 
How is duodenal biliary drainage done?,"'For duodenal biliary drainage, a thin ''plastic'"" or rubber tube with several holes at its tip is passed through a patient's anesthetized nostril, down the back of the throat, through the ""'esophagus'' and stomach, and into the duodenum where the bile and pancreatic ducts enter the small intestine. This is accomplished with the help of fluoroscopy, a type of X-ray. Once the tube is in place, a synthetic hormone related to cholecystokinin is injected intravenously. The hormone causes the gallbladder to contract and squeeze out its concentrated bile into the duodenum. The bile then is sucked up through the tube and examined for the presence of ''cholesterol'' and pigment particles under a microscope.''A modification of duodenal biliary drainage involves collection of bile through an endoscope at the time of an upper gastrointestinal ''endoscopy'' - either by  ''EGD'' (''esophagogastroduodenoscopy'') or by ''ERCP'' (''endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography'').' "
Why might duodenal biliary drainage be done?,"'Gallstones'' begin as microscopic particles of cholesterol or pigment that grow in size. Once the particles grow large enough to become ''gallstones'', they can obstruct the bile ducts and cause problems. It is clear that some people who develop the symptoms and complications of gallstones -- ''biliary colic'', ''cholecystitis'', or ''pancreatitis'' - have only these microscopic particles in their gallbladders, particles too small to obstruct the bile ducts.''There are two possible explanations for how obstruction might be occurring in this situation. The first is that a small gallstone obstructed the bile ducts but finally passed through the bile ducts into the intestine. The second is that the particles passing through the bile ducts ""irritate"" the ducts, causing spasm of the muscle within the walls of the ducts (which obstructs the duct) or causing inflammation of the duct so that the wall of the duct  swells (which also obstructs the duct).' "
What are the risks of duodenal biliary drainage?,"'The risks to the patient of duodenal biliary drainage are almost nonexistent.  There have been no reports of reactions to the synthetic hormone.  Nevertheless, the presence of the tube in the throat is uncomfortable for the 30-60 minutes that are necessary to complete the test.' "
When is duodenal biliary drainage useful?,"""Once again, it's been decades since duodenal biliary drainage was the medical standard. Still, it can useful in diagnosing problems related to gallstones when other tests such as ""'ultrasonography'"" have not demonstrated gallstones, but suspicion is high that gallstones are the cause of the patient's problem. Cholesterol or pigment particles without gallstones may be present in individuals who have no medical problems or problems that are not due to gallstones. It is unclear whether these individuals ultimately are more likely to develop gallstones. Because such individuals exist, it also is important not to assume that particles mean that gallstones are the cause of a medical problem. The medical problem and its symptoms should be typical of the types of problems caused by gallstones."" "
What is a duodenal diverticulum?,"'A duodenal ''diverticulum'' (the plural of which is diverticula) is a pouch attached to the duodenum, the second part of the small intestine just past the stomach.''There are two types of duodenal diverticula. The common type which is present in some individuals, is one that sticks out from the duodenum, similar to the more common colonic diverticula. This is referred to as an ""extramural"" diverticulum. Extramural diverticula may vary in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters. They usually are located in the area around the Papilla of Vater where the bile and pancreatic ducts enter the duodenum.''A second, rare type of diverticulum is referred to as an ""intramural"" diverticulum. It does not protrude from the duodenum. Rather, it protrudes into the duodenal lumen (the hollow inside of the duodenum through which digesting food flows). Both types of diverticula, extramural and intramural, communicate with the lumen of the duodenum so that contents of the duodenum can enter the diverticulum.'  "
What causes a duodenal diverticulum?,"'The cause of extramural diverticula is not definitively known; however, they are believed to be acquired (not present from birth) due to a herniation (protrusion) of the duodenum through a defect in the muscle of the wall of the duodenum, perhaps in an area where arteries pass through the intestinal muscle to nourish the lining of the intestine.' "
What complications are caused by a duodenal diverticulum?,"'Extramural diverticula usually cause no symptoms. Occasionally, they may  rupture (just like colonic diverticula) and lead to a pocket of inflammation adjacent to the duodenum with or without infection. This may result in all the signs and symptoms of intra-abdominal inflammation including ''pain'', ''fever'', and abdominal tenderness. ''If the diverticulum is very close to the Ampulla of Vater, patients more frequently develop ''gallstones'', particularly in the bile duct, and may develop all of the complications of ''gallstones'':''Pancreatitis'' also may occur. These complications are believed to be due to interference by the diverticula with the normal function of the bile and pancreatic ducts.' biliary colic (the typical pain 
of obstruction of the bile ducts),  cholecystitis (inflammation of the 
gallbladder), and  cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts due to the spread 
of bacteria into the ducts from the duodenum). "
How is a duodenal diverticulum diagnosed?,"'Extramural duodenal diverticula are most commonly diagnosed by barium ''X-rays'' of the upper gastrointestinal tract. They also may be diagnosed at the time of ''endoscopy'' or, less frequently, with ''ultrasonography''. Finally, they also may show up by chance in computerized tomographic (CT) scans or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') studies of the abdomen.'  "
How is a duodenal diverticulum treated?,"'If treatment is necessary, extramural diverticula can be surgically removed from the outside of the duodenum. The diverticula also may be inverted into the lumen of the duodenum and removed through an incision in the wall of the duodenum. (Sometimes, the diverticulum is inverted but left attached to the wall of the duodenum and protruding into the duodenum.)'  "
What about intramural diverticula?,"'The cause of intramural diverticula is not clear; however, they are believed to be congenital, that is, present from birth, and may occur as a developmental abnormality of the intestine in the fetus.''Intramural duodenal diverticula most commonly cause obstruction of the duodenum when the diverticulum fills with ingested material. They are commonly diagnosed by barium X-ray studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract, but also are seen with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.''Intramural diverticula are surgically removed through an incision in the wall of the duodenum, although there are reports of treatment using non-surgical, endoscopic means to incise or open up the diverticula so that material does not collect within them.' "
What is upper endoscopy?,"'Upper endoscopy is a procedure that enables the examiner (usually a ''gastroenterologist'') to examine the ''esophagus'' (swallowing tube), stomach, and duodenum (first portion of small bowel) using a thin, flexible tube called the upper endoscope with a camera on the tip through which the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum can be viewed using a TV monitor.'  "
How do I prepare for endoscopy?,"'To accomplish a safe and complete examination, the stomach should be empty. The patient will most likely be asked to have nothing to eat or drink for six hours or more prior to the procedure.''Prior to scheduling the procedure, the patient should inform his or her physician of any medications being taken, any ''allergies'"", and all known health problems. This information will help the doctor determine whether the patient may need antibiotics prior to the procedure, and what potential medications should not be used during the exam because of the patient's ""'allergies''. The information will provide the individual scheduling the procedure an opportunity to instruct the patient whether any of the medications should be held or adjusted prior to the endoscopy.''Knowledge that the patient has any major health problems, such as ''heart'' or lung diseases, will alert the doctor of possible need for special attention during the procedure.'  "
Why has my doctor ordered an endoscopy?,"'Upper endoscopy usually is performed to evaluate possible problems with the esophagus, stomach or duodenum, and evaluate symptoms such as upper ''abdominal pain'', ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'', difficulty in swallowing, or intestinal bleeding ''anemia''. Upper endoscopy is more accurate than gastrointestinal ''X-rays'' for detecting inflammation or smaller abnormalities such as ulcers or tumors within the reach of the instrument. Its other major advantage over X-rays is the ability to perform biopsies (obtain small pieces of tissue) or cytology (obtain some cells with a fine brush) for microscopic examination to determine the nature of the abnormality and whether any abnormality is benign or ''malignant'' (cancerous).''Biopsies are taken for many reasons, and it may not mean that your doctor suspects ''cancer''.'"" Upper endoscopy also can be used to treat many conditions within its reach. The endoscope's channels permit passage of accessory instruments enabling the examiner to treat many of the conditions such as stretching areas of narrowing (strictures, Schatzki ring), removal of benign growths such as polyps, retrieving accidentally swallowed objects, or treating upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as seen in ulcers tears of the lining. These capabilities have markedly reduced the need for transfusions or surgery"" "
What can I expect before and during the procedure? Will I be awake?,"'Before the procedure, the doctor will discuss with you why the procedure is being done, whether there are alternative procedures or tests, and what possible complications may result from the endoscopy.''Practices vary amongst doctors, but the patient may have the throat sprayed with a numbing solution and will probably be given sedating and ''pain'' alleviating medications through a vein. You will be relaxed after receiving this medication, usually midazolam (''Versed'') for sedation and ''fentanyl'' for ''pain'' relief, and you may even go to ''sleep''. This form of sedation is called ''conscious sedation'', and usually is administered by a nurse who monitors you during the entire procedure.''You also may be sedated using propofol (Diprivan) called ""''deep sedation'',"" which usually is administered by a nurse anesthetist or anesthesiologist who monitors your vital signs (''blood pressure'' and pulse) as well as the amount of oxygen in your blood during the procedure.''After you are sedated while lying on your left side the flexible video endoscope, the thickness of a small finger, is passed through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This procedure will NOT interfere with your ''breathing''. Most people experience only minimal discomfort during the test, and many ''sleep'' throughout the entire procedure using conscious sedation. Deep sedation ensures that you feel no discomfort during the entire procedure.'  "
What happens after the procedure? Can I drive?,"'When the procedure has been completed, you will be observed and monitored by a qualified individual in the endoscopy room or a recovery area until much of the effects of the medications have worn off.''Occasionally, endoscopy may cause a mild ''sore throat'', which promptly responds to saline gargles, or a feeling of distention from the air that was used during the procedure. Both problems are mild and transient.''When fully recovered, the you will be instructed when to resume your usual ''diet'' (probably within a few hours), and the your driver will be allowed to take you home. (Because of the use of sedation, most facilities mandate that a driver take patients home and not drive, handle machinery, or make important decisions for the remainder of the day.)' "
What are the risks of endoscopy?,"'Endoscopy is a safe procedure and when performed by a physician with specialized training in these procedures, the complications are extremely rare. They may include localized irritation of the vein where the medication was administered, reaction to the medication or ''sedatives'' used, complications from pre-existing heart, lung, or ''liver disease'', bleeding may occur at the site of a biopsy or removal of a polyp (which if it occurs is almost always minor and rarely requires transfusions or surgery). Major complications such as perforation (punching a hole through the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum) are rare but usually require surgical repair.' "
When will I recevie the results of my endoscopy?,"'Under most circumstances, the examining physician will inform the patient of the test results or the probable findings prior to discharge from the recovery area. The results of biopsies or cytology usually take 72-96 hours and the doctor may only give the patient a presumptive diagnosis pending the definitive one, after the microscopic examination of the biopsies.'  "
What if I still have questions after the procedure?,"'If you have any questions or concerns about the exam, costs, whether your insurance will cover it, or methods of billing, talk to your doctor or another healthcare professional. Most endoscopists are highly trained specialists and will be happy to discuss their qualifications and answer any questions.' "
Facts you should know about a Dupuytren's contracture," A Dupuytren's contracture is a localized scar tissue formation in the palm. The precise cause of a Dupuytren's contracture is not known. A Dupuytren's contracture is sometimes inherited. A Dupuytren's contracture can limit extension of the affected finger. The treatment of a Dupuytren's contracture depends on the severity and the underlying condition of the affected individual. Treatments include stretching, heat, ultrasound, local cortisone injection, surgical procedures, and collagen injection."
What is a Dupuytren's contracture?,"""A Dupuytren's contracture is a localized formation of ""'scar'"" tissue around the tendons that flex the fingers beneath the skin of the palm of the hand. The scarring accumulates in a tissue (palmar fascia) that normally covers the tendons that pull the fingers to grip. As a Dupuytren's contracture progresses, more of the fascia becomes thickened and shortened. Dimpling and puckering of the skin over the area eventually occurs and ultimately can make it impossible to fully extend the fingers (as in laying the hand flat on a tabletop).""  "
How fast does a Dupuytren's contracture develop?,"""A Dupuytren's contracture usually progresses slowly over years. In rare cases, it can progress more rapidly."" "
What are the causes and risk factors of a Dupuytren's contracture?,"""The precise cause of a Dupuytren's contracture is not known. However, it is known that it occurs more frequently in patients with ""'diabetes mellitus'', ''seizure disorders'' (''epilepsy''), and ''alcoholism''.'""A Dupuytren's contracture can be inherited. In medical terms, the inherited form of a Dupuytren's contracture is transferred in the family as a so-called autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance and partial sex-limitation. This means that the gene for a Dupuytren's contracture is not on an X or Y chromosome (sex chromosome) but on one of the other 44 chromosomes. Consequently, one version of the gene is enough to cause the disorder (it is dominant), but not everyone who has the gene has the disorder (the gene is not fully penetrant), and the disorder is most frequent in males (the gene expression is partially limited to males).""""Typically, a Dupuytren's contractures occur in males over the age of 50. It is more common in males of Northern European descent. The ring and little finger are affected most commonly."" "
What are the symptoms and signs of a Dupuytren's contracture?,"""A Dupuytren's contracture initially may cause only a minor painless lump in the palm of the hand near the base of the finger(s). A Dupuytren's contracture most commonly affects the ring (fourth) finger and little finger, but it can affect any finger.

Facts you should know about a Dupuytren's contracture," A Dupuytren's contracture is a localized scar tissue formation in the palm. The precise cause of a Dupuytren's contracture is not known. A Dupuytren's contracture is sometimes inherited. A Dupuytren's contracture can limit extension of the affected finger.

Treatments include stretching, heat, ultrasound, local cortisone injection, surgical procedures, and collagen injection."
What is a Dupuytren's contracture?,"""A Dupuytren's contracture is a localized formation of ""'scar'"" tissue around the tendons that flex the fingers beneath the skin of the palm of the hand. The scarring accumulates in a tissue (palmar fascia) that normally covers the tendons that pull the fingers to grip. As a Dupuytren's contracture progresses, more of the fascia becomes thickened and shortened. Dimpling and puckering of the skin over the area eventually occurs and ultimately can make it impossible to fully extend the fingers (as in laying the hand flat on a tabletop).""  "

However, it is known that it occurs more frequently in patients with ""'diabetes mellitus'', ''seizure disorders'' (''epilepsy''), and ''alcoholism''.'""A Dupuytren's contracture can be inherited. In medical terms, the inherited form of a Dupuytren's contracture is transferred in the family as a so-called autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance and partial sex-limitation. This means that the gene for a Dupuytren's contracture is not on an X or Y chromosome (sex chromosome) but on one of the other 44 chromosomes. Consequently, one version of the gene is enough to cause the disorder (it is dominant), but not everyone who has the gene has the disorder (the gene is not fully penetrant), and the disorder is most frequent in males (the gene expression is partially limited to males).""""Typically, a Dupuytren's contractures occur in males over the age of 50.

What is a D&C procedure?,'D&C or dilation and curettage is a surgical procedure that involves the expansion of the cervical opening to remove the uterine lining (''endometrium'') with a spoon-shaped instrument known as a curette. D&C is mainly done to identify the cause of abnormal uterine bleeding.''Other related procedures used for diagnosing and treating endometrial issue include:' Endometrial ablation Hysteroscopy Hysterectomy
Why is D&C performed?,'D&C may be indicated:' To identify the causes of abnormal uterine bleeding To end an unwanted pregnancy To determine the intensity of the endometrial cancer To identify polyps or tissue overgrowth To identify scar tissue To remove abnormal tissue
What are the reasons not to have a D&C?,"'Some of the reasons to avoid D&C include:' Women unfit for surgery Arthritis (in this condition, the woman cannot move their legs apart) Pregnancy unless it is an unwanted one"
How to prepare for a D&C procedure?,"'For a D&C procedure, you must follow these instructions:' The physician might obtain your consent before the procedure Inform the physician about your current medications Eat light meals the evening before the surgery Do not eat or drink anything after midnight before the procedure day You might be given an enema on the previous night Stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve), clopidogrel (Plavix), and other blood thinners or any other herbal supplement Ask the doctor about the drugs that you can continue till the day of surgery Inform about any bleeding disorders or other medical conditions Avoid smoking to help you recover quickly"
How is a D&C procedure performed?,"'D&C mostly follows this process:' You will be positioned on an operating table. A urinary catheter may be placed before entering the operating room. An IV catheter will be started in the arm or hand. The hair around the surgical site may be shaved. The cervix will be cleaned with an antiseptic solution. You may get regional anesthesia, either an epidural or spinal block to numb you from the waist down. The doctor uses a type of forceps, called a tenaculum, to hold the cervix throughout the procedure. For dilation or opening of the cervix, the doctor may either insert slender rods (laminaria) into the cervix or use medication beforehand to soften and widen the cervix. Each rod will be wider than the previous one. This helps to gradually open the cervix or mouth of the uterus. Once the cervix is opened to a suitable size, the doctor inserts curette to reach the uterus. Next, the doctor scrapes the endometrium or the uterine lining, which will be removed by suction. A hysteroscopy may help the physician to view the uterus as the procedure progresses. The collected samples are sent for further investigation."
What are the complications of D&C?,'The complications of D&C includes:' Heavy or prolonged bleeding Blood clots Fever Pain Abdominal tenderness Foul-smelling discharge from the vagina Asherman syndrome (formation of scar tissue in the uterus) Infertility Changes in menstrual flow
What are the different types of a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus (womb) and usually the cervix (neck of the womb). Depending on the reason for a hysterectomy, the surgeon may also remove the tubes (salpingectomy) and ovaries (''oophorectomy''). A hysterectomy is performed under general anesthesia. The different types of hysterectomy include:''There are three possible methods of doing a hysterectomy:' Total hysterectomy: The most common type of hysterectomy, this surgery removes the entire uterus, including the cervix. The ovaries and fallopian tubes may or may not be removed. Partial hysterectomy: It is also called a subtotal or supracervical hysterectomy. In this procedure, only the upper part of the uterus is removed. The cervix is left in place. The ovaries may or may not be removed. Radical hysterectomy: All of the uterus, cervix, tissue on both sides of the cervix, and upper part of the vagina are removed. This is often used to treat certain types of cancer such as cervical cancer. The fallopian tubes and ovaries may or may not be removed. Abdominal hysterectomy: The uterus, cervix, (plus or minus) fallopian tubes, and ovaries may be removed through a vertical (standing direction) or horizontal (sleeping direction) incision in the abdomen. Hospital stay will be for –four to five days. Vaginal hysterectomy: The uterus and cervix will be removed through an incision made at the top of the vagina. The fallopian tubes and ovaries may also be removed if there are risk factors. The vagina gets loose approximately 1-2 cm in length as a result of the surgery. A hospital stay may be for –two to three days. Laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy: This hysterectomy is performed under the guidance of a special camera passed through a “keyhole” in the abdomen and with other instruments passed through separate “keyholes.” The uterus is most commonly removed through the vagina, although sometimes it might be morcellated (removed in small pieces) through the keyholes. In some cases, the entire operation is performed through the keyholes (total laparoscopic hysterectomy)."
What to expect after a hysterectomy?,"'In general, patients may need to be mentally and physically ready to accept the after-effects of a hysterectomy:''The physician should be immediately notified if patients experience' The first 24 hours after a hysterectomy, patients may experience some vaginal bleeding that slowly tapers off. If the bleeding seems to be getting heavier rather than lighter, the physician should be notified immediately. Patients may feel extremely tired afterward; tiredness may last for up to several weeks. Try to take frequent rest breaks to gradually regain strength. For several weeks, patients may have a vaginal discharge that appears bloody at first, then gradually becomes thinner and lighter over time. If both the ovaries are removed, patients may experience symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. If necessary, the physician may recommend hormone replacement therapy to help alleviate discomfort. Patients may have a sense of loss that causes depression and decreased appetite, concentration, and sleep. These feelings and reactions are normal and should diminish with time. If they persist or significantly disrupt life, patients are encouraged to talk with the physician or supportive care provider such as a psychologist. Fever or other signs of infection Heavy bleeding (soaking through a pad in less than one hour) Severe pain that does not respond to medications Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea or constipation Difficulty urinating or a foul odor from the vagina"
What is deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,"'Deep vein thrombosis'' or ''DVT'"" describes a blood clot (thrombosis) that forms in the deep veins located in the arm or leg. It is important to know the body's anatomy and function to understand why clots form in veins and why they can be dangerous."" Arteries have thin muscles within their walls to be able to withstand the pressure of the heart pumping blood to the far reaches of the body. Veins don't have a significant muscle lining, and there is nothing pumping blood back to the heart except physiology. Blood returns to the heart because the body's large muscles squeeze the veins as they contract in their normal activity of moving the body. The normal activities of moving the body returns the blood back to the heart. Being mobile causes this blood return system to fail, and the resulting stagnated blood may clot. There are two types of veins in the arm or leg; superficial veins and deep veins. Superficial veins lie just below the skin and are easily seen on the surface. Deep veins, as their name implies, are located deep within the muscles of the extremity. Blood flows from the superficial veins into the deep venous system through small perforator veins. Superficial and perforator veins have one-way valves within them that allow blood to flow only in the direction of the heart when the veins are squeezed. A blood clot (thrombus) in the deep venous system of the leg or arm, in itself, is not dangerous. It becomes potentially life threatening when a piece of the blood clot breaks off and embolizes, travels through the circulation system through the heart, and enters into one of the pulmonary arteries and becomes lodged. This can prevent blood from flowing properly through the lung and decreasing the amount of oxygen absorbed and distributed back to the body. Diagnosis and treatment of a DVT is meant to prevent pulmonary embolism. Blood clots in the superficial veins do not pose a danger of causing pulmonary emboli because the perforator vein valves act as a sieve to prevent clots from entering the deep venous system. They are usually not at risk of causing pulmonary embolism."
7 early warning signs and symptoms of DVT,"'The signs and symptoms of DVT are related to obstruction of blood returning to the heart and causing a backup of blood in the leg. Classic symptoms include:''You may or may not have all of these symptoms, or your may have none. The symptoms of the condition may mimic an infection or ''cellulitis'' of the arm or leg.'""In the past, doctors and other healthcare professionals performed simple tests on patients to make a diagnosis of a blood clot in the leg; however, they have not been effective. For example, pulling the patient's toes toward the nose (Homans' sign), and squeezing the calf to produce pain (Pratt's sign). Today, doctors and health care professionals usually do not rely upon whether these signs and symptoms are present to make the diagnosis or decide that you have DVT."" Pain Swelling Warmth Redness Leg cramps, often starting in the calf Leg pain that worsens when bending the foot Bluish or whitish skin discoloration"
What are the signs and symptoms of superficial blood clots?,"'Blood clots in the superficial vein system (closer to the surface of the skin), most often occur due to ''trauma'' to the vein, which causes a small blood clot to form. Inflammation of the vein and surrounding skin causes the symptoms similar to any other type of inflammation, for example,''You often can feel the vein as a firm, thickened cord. There may be inflammation that follows the course of part of the leg vein. Although there is inflammation, there is no infection.''Varicosities ''can predispose to superficial thrombophlebitis and ''varicose veins''. This occurs when the valves of the larger veins in the superficial system fail (the greater and lesser saphenous veins), which allows blood to back up and cause the veins to swell and become distorted or tortuous. The valves fail when veins lose their elasticity and stretch. This can be due to age, prolonged standing, ''obesity'', ''pregnancy'', and genetic factors.'   Redness Warmth Tenderness Swelling"
How do you get deep vein thrombosis?,"'Blood is meant to flow. If it becomes stagnant, there is a potential for it to clot. The blood in veins constantly forms microscopic clots that are routinely broken down by the body. If the balance of clot formation and clot breakdown is altered, significant clotting may occur. A thrombus can form if one or a combination of the following situations.'   Prolonged travel and sitting, such as long airplane flights (""economy class syndrome""), car, or train travel Hospitalization Surgery Trauma to the lower leg with or without surgery or casting Pregnancy, including 6-8 weeks post-partum after delivery of the baby Obesity Medications such as birth control pills (oral contraceptives), for example, Ortho-Novum, Yaz, Yasmin, Microgestin, Kelnor, and other estrogens Smoking Genetic or hereditary predisposition to clot formation Increased number of red blood cells (Polycythemia) Cancer Trauma to the vein Fracture to the leg or arm Bruised leg or arm Complication of an invasive procedure of the vein"
What are the risk factors for DVT?,"'Many people are at risk for developing blood clots, for example:' Immobility, including prolonged bed rest due to illness or injury and long travel in a car or airplane Pregnancy Birth control pills or hormone therapy Smoking Cancer Surgery that damages the veins in an arm or leg Family history or genetic predisposition to forming blood clots Obesity"
What tests diagnose DVT?,"'The diagnosis of ''superficial'' thrombophlebitis usually is made by the doctor at the bedside of the patient, based upon history, potential risk factors present, and findings from the physical examination. Further risk stratification tools may include scoring systems that can help decide whether a DVT is likely.''If the probability of a leg thrombosis is low, a D-Dimer blood test may be ordered.''D-Dimer is a blood test that may be used as a screening test to determine if a blood clot exists. D-Dimer is a chemical that is produced when a blood clot in the body gradually dissolves. The test is used as a positive or negative indicator. If the result is negative, then in most cases no blood clot exists. If the D-Dimer test is positive, it does not necessarily mean that a deep vein thrombosis is present since many situations will have an expected positive result. Any bruise or blood clot will result in a positive D-Dimer result (for example, from surgery, a fall, in ''cancer'' or in pregnancy). For that reason, D-Dimer testing must be used selectively.'   If the D-Dimer is negative, then it is unlikely that a DVT is the diagnosis. If the D-dimer is elevated, then the possibility of a DVT exists and an imaging study, usually ultrasound, is required to look for the DVT Ultrasound is the standard method of diagnosing the presence of a deep vein thrombosis. The ultrasound technician may be able to determine whether a clot exists, where it is located in the leg or arm, and how large it is. It also may be possible to know whether the blood clot is new or chronic. If necessary, ultrasounds may be compared over time to see whether a clot has grown or resolved. Ultrasound is better at ""seeing"" the veins above the knee as compared to the small veins below the knee joint. Clots in the chest or pelvis may not be identified on ultrasound. Venography, injecting dye into the veins to look for a thrombus, is not usually performed anymore and has become more of a historical footnote. Other blood testing may be considered based on the potential cause for the deep vein thrombosis."
What are the treatment and management guidelines for DVT? Does it go away?,"'The treatment for deep venous thrombosis is anticoagulation or ""thinning the blood"" with medications.'""The recommended length of treatment for an uncomplicated DVT is three months. Depending upon the patient's situation, underlying medical conditions, and the reason for developing a blood clot, a longer duration of anticoagulation may be required. At three months, the doctor or otherhealth care professional should evaluate the patient in regard to the potential for future blood clot formation.""'If the decision is made to continue with anticoagulation therapy for the long term, the risk/reward for preventing clots versus bleeding risks should be evaluated by your doctor.'  "
What is the treatment of superficial blood clots?,"'Treatment for superficial thrombophlebitis treating the symptoms with:''If the thrombophlebitis occurs near the groin where the superficial and deep systems join together, there is potential that the thrombus could extend into the deep venous system. These patients may require anticoagulation or blood thinning therapy.' Warm compresses Leg compression Anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen (Mortin) or naproxen (Naprocen)."
What are the side effects and risks of anticoagulation therapy?,"'People who take anticoagulation medications are at risk for bleeding. The decision to use these medications must balance the risk and rewards of the treatment. Should bleeding occur, there are strategies available to reverse the anticoagulation effects.''Some people may have contraindications to anticoagulation therapy, for example a patient with bleeding in the brain, major trauma, or recent significant surgery. An alternative may be to place a filter in the inferior vena cava (the major vein that collects blood from both legs) to prevent emboli, should they arise, from reaching the heart and lungs. These filters may be effective but have the potential risk of being the source of new clot formation. An IVC filter is NOT recommended for patients who are also taking anticoagulation medications.' "
8 medications used for the treatment of DVT,"'Anticoagulation prevents further growth of the blood clot and prevents it from forming an embolus that can travel to the lung. The body has a complex mechanism to form blood clots to help repair blood vessel damage. There is a clotting cascade with numerous blood factors that have to be activated for a clot to form. There are difference types of medications that can be used for anticoagulation to treat DVT:''The American College of Chest Physicians has guidelines that give direction as to what medications might best be used in different situations. For example, a patient with a DVT, and no active cancer, treatment with a NOAC would be recommended. If active cancer exists, the treatment of DVT would be with enoxaparin as the drug of first choice.''NOACs work almost immediately to thin the blood and anticoagulate the patient. There is no need for blood tests to monitor dosing. The NOAC medications presently approved for deep vein thrombosis treatment include:'""All four are also indicated to treat pulmonary embolism. They also may be prescribed to patients' anticoagulated with nonvalvular ""'atrial fibrillation'' to prevent ''stroke'' and systemic embolus.' Unfractionated heparin Low molecular weight heparin: enoxaparin (Lovenox) Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) also known as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) Warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) apixaban (Eliquis) rivaroxaban (Xarelto) edoxaban (Savaysa) dabigatran (Pradaxa)"
"Warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven)","'Warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) is an anti-coagulation medication that acts as a ''Vitamin K'' antagonist, blocking blood-clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. Historically, it was a first-line medication for treating blood clots, but its role has been diminished because of the availability of newer ''drugs''. While warfarin may be prescribed immediately after the diagnosis of DVT, it takes up to a week or more for it to reach therapeutic levels in the blood so that the blood is appropriately thinned. Therefore, low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin [Lovenox)] is administered at the same time. Enoxaparin thins the blood almost immediately and is used as a ''bridge'' therapy until the warfarin has taken effect. Enoxaparin injections can be given on an outpatient basis. For those patients who have contraindications to the use of enoxaparin (for example, ''kidney failure'' does not allow the drug to be appropriately metabolized), intravenous heparin can be used as the first step in association with warfarin. This requires admission to the hospital. The dosage of warfarin is monitored by blood tests measuring the prothrombin time (PT), or INR (international normalized ratio).' "
Does DVT require surgery?,"'Surgery is a rare option in treating large deep venous thrombosis of the leg in patients who cannot take blood thinners or who have developed recurrent blood clots while on anti-coagulant medications. The surgery is usually accompanied by placing an IVC (inferior vena cava) filter to prevent future clots from embolizing to the lung.''Phlegmasia Cerulea Dolens describes a situation in which a blood clot forms in the iliac vein of the pelvis and the femoral vein of the leg, obstructing almost all blood return and compromising blood supply to the leg. In this case, surgery may be considered to remove the clot, but the patient will also require anti-coagulant medications. ''Stents'' may also be required to keep a vein open and prevent clotting. May Thurer Syndrome, also known as iliac vein compression syndrome, is a cause of phlegmasia, in which the iliac vein in the pelvis is compressed and a ''stent'' is needed.' "
What are the complications of DVT?,"'Pulmonary embolism is the major complication of deep vein thrombosis. With signs and symptoms such as ''chest pain'' and ''shortness of breath'', it is a life-threatening condition. Most often pulmonary emboli arise from the legs.''Post-phlebitic syndrome can occur after a deep vein thrombosis. The affected leg or arm can become chronically swollen and painful with skin color changes and ulcer formation around the foot and ankle.' "
Can DVT be prevented?,"   Minimize risk factors for DVT; for example, quit smoking (especially if the person also is taking birth control pills or hormone therapy). In the hospital setting, the staff works hard to provide DVT prophylaxis to minimize the potential for clot formation in immobilized patients. Surgery patients are out of bed walking (ambulatory) earlier and low dose heparin or enoxaparin is being used for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis (measures taken to prevent DVT). When traveling, it is recommended that you get up and walk every couple of hours during a long trip."
Which types of doctors treat DVT?,"'People with a swollen extremity or concern that a DVT exists may be cared for by a variety of health-care professionals. Both the primary care provider (including internal medicine and family medicine specialists) and a health care professional at in an urgent care (walk in) clinic or emergency department are able to recognize and diagnose the condition. Some people go to the hospital and the diagnosis is made there.'""Treatment is usually started by the doctor who makes the diagnosis, but long-term treatment decisions, risk stratification, and follow-up usually is be done by the person's primary care doctor. Depending upon the situation, a hematologist (specialist in ""'blood disorders'') may be consulted. If there is need for the clot to be removed or dissolved, an interventional radiologist may also be involved.''Depending upon the medication used to anticoagulate the blood, pharmacists and anticoagulation nurses may also be involved on your treatment team.' "
Facts you should know about DVT (deep vein thrombosis) and birth control pills,"  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the most common type of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and it refers to blood clots that form in the deep veins of the thigh, lower leg, pelvis, or arm. Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) can slightly increase the risk of developing blood clots, including DVT, but this increased risk remains less than the risk of blood clots associated with pregnancy. Some people with DVT may have no symptoms; however, when they do experience they may include:SwellingPainRednessWarmthLeg or calf painLarge veinsLeg crampsSkin discoloration Swelling Pain Redness Warmth Leg or calf pain Large veins Leg cramps Skin discoloration If DVT is not treated, it can cause complications including pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome.

What is deep vein thrombosis (DVT)?,"'A ''blood clot'' in a deep vein is called a venous thromboembolism (VTE). ''Deep vein thrombosis'' (''DVT'') is the most common type of VTE, and it refers to blood clots that form in the deep veins of the thigh, lower leg, pelvis, or arm. When clots form in these deep veins, blood can back up, causing swelling and ''pain''.''DVT can be dangerous because if the ''blood clot'' breaks off, it can travel through the bloodstream and block blood vessels in other parts of the body. ''Pulmonary embolism'' (PE) is a condition that can be fatal that occurs when blood clots break off from the legs or pelvis and travel to the ''lungs''.' "
What are the early warning signs and symptoms of DVT?,"'If a clot is small, there may be no ''symptoms of DVT''. Typical symptoms are related to the backup of blood in the leg and include:'  Swelling Pain or tenderness in the thigh, calf, or foot Redness Warmth Veins in the affected leg may appear larger than normal Leg cramps, especially at night Bluish or whitish discoloration of skin"
What are the later signs and symptoms of DVT?,"'If DVT is not treated, it can cause complications including ''pulmonary embolism'' (PE) and post-thrombotic syndrome.''If a ''blood clot'' breaks off and travels to the ''lungs'', it can block blood vessels, causing a pulmonary embolism, which can be fatal. A ''blood clot in the lung'' (pulmonary embolism) is a medical emergency. ''If you have any ''symptoms of DVT'' seek medical treatment immediately.''The later signs and symptoms ''of a blood clot in the lung include:''Another complication of DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome, which affects the tissues in the calf and can cause ''long-term symptoms'' including:' Shortness of breath Chest pain, worse with coughing or moving Cough, may be bloody or contain phlegm Back pain Increased sweating Lightheadedness or fainting Rapid heartbeat Blue lips or nails (cyanosis) Calf pain Dilated blood vessels in the leg Swelling Rash Skin discoloration Ulcers on the calf (in severe cases)"
Can birth control pills (oral contraceptives) cause DVT?,"'Birth control pills'' can slightly increase the risk of developing blood clots, including DVT. However, the increased risk of blood clots from ''birth control pills'' is less than the risk of blood clots associated with ''pregnancy''.''The risk of developing a blood clot is highest in the first year of oral ''contraceptive'' pill (OCP) use. The risk decreases after the first year, but still remains until the pills are stopped.' "
Which birth control methods have fewer risks of developing DVT?,"'Emergency contraception'' such as ''Plan B'' (or the morning after\xa0pill) is not meant to be used as ''birth control'', but it also does not contain estrogen and does not increase the risk of blood clots and DVT.' Implant: etonogestrel implant (Nexplanon) Intrauterine devices (IUDs): Paragard, Mirena, Skyla, and Liletta Contraceptive shots: medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) Progestin-only birth control pills Condoms Diaphragms"
What are the risk factors for DVTs and birth control pills?,"'If you have had blood clots in the past or have risk factors for blood clots, check with your doctor before taking any birth control pills.''Risk factors for blood clots include:''Other medical conditions that increase the risk of blood clots include:'  Smoking Obesity Genetic blood clotting disorders such as Factor V Leiden mutation Previous history of blood clots Family history of blood clots Age over 40 Heart disease Lung disease Inflammatory bowel disease or IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) Recent childbirth Being on bed rest or sitting for long periods of time"
Will a blood clot in the leg go away on its own? Is it serious?,"'Serious and even fatal complications such as pulmonary embolism can arise from untreated blood clots. ''If you think you may have symptoms of a blood clot, see your doctor right away.' "
What is DVT (deep vein thrombosis)?  ,"'A venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a ''blood clot'' in a deep vein. The most common type of VTE is ''deep vein thrombosis'' (DVT), which refers to blood clots in the deep veins of the leg, arm, or pelvis. When blood clots form in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, or pelvis, this can cause blood to back up, resulting in swelling and ''pain''.''DVT can be dangerous because if the blood clot breaks off, it can travel to other parts of the body and block blood vessels there. Blood clots can travel from the legs to the lungs causing ''pulmonary embolism'' (PE), which can be fatal.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of DVT?,'Common ''symptoms of DVT'' in the legs include:'  Swelling Pain Warmth Redness
What are the risk factors for developing DVT during pregnancy?,"'Pregnancy itself is a risk factor developing of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). ''Pregnant'' women have venous thromboembolism (VTE) at a rate 4 to 50 times higher than women who are not pregnant. The risk for venous thromboembolism is higher in the postpartum period, right after a woman has given birth, is two to five times greater.'  Varicose veins Diabetes Multiple gestation (carrying twins or multiples) Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Urinary tract infection (UTI) A body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater Over 35 years of age Hospitalization for non-delivery reasons (especially those lasting more than 3 days)"
What are the risk factors for developing DVT postpartum?,"'In the postpartum period, particularly within the first 6 weeks after delivery, risk factors for VTE/DVT include:' Cesarean section, particularly emergency C-sections Stillbirth High blood pressure (hypertension) Eclampsia or preeclampsia Postpartum infection Obstetric hemorrhage Preterm delivery at less than 36 weeks Other underlying medical conditions (such as cardiac disease, varicose veins, inflammatory bowel disease) A body mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater Age over 35 years Smoking"
What are the treatment and management guidelines for DVT during pregnancy?,'Anticoagulation therapy is the treatment for DVT diagnosed during pregnancy. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) usually are the first-line medications. ''Anticoagulant'' therapy may need to be continued into the postpartum period when the risk of DVT/VTE increases.''Warfarin'' should be avoided during pregnancy because it can harm a developing fetus.' 
Is DVT dangerous during pregnancy? Can it be fatal?,"'If a blood clot in the legs breaks off and travels to the lungs, this can result in a pulmonary embolism (PE), which can be fatal. PE is the seventh leading cause of maternal death (mortality), accounting for 9% of maternal deaths.' "
What is achondroplasia?,"'Achondroplasia is a genetic (inherited) condition that results in abnormally short stature and is the most common cause of short stature with disproportionately short limbs. The average height of an adult with achondroplasia is 131 cm (52 inches, or 4 foot 4 inches) in males and 124 cm (49 inches, or 4 foot 1 inch) in females.''Although achondroplasia literally means ""without cartilage formation,"" the defect in achondroplasia is not in forming cartilage but in converting it to bone, particularly in the long bones.''Achondroplasia is one of the oldest known ''birth defects''. The frequency of achondroplasia is estimated to range from about 1 in 10,000 births in Latin America to about 12 in 77,000 in Denmark. An average figure worldwide is approximately 1 in 25,000 births.' "
What are the characteristics of achondroplasia?,"'Achondroplasia is a distinctive condition that usually can be noted at birth.'   The baby with achondroplasia has a relatively long, narrow torso (trunk) with short extremities (arms and legs) and a disproportionate shortening of the proximal (near the torso) segments of the limbs (the upper arms and thighs). There is a typically large head with prominence of the forehead (frontal bossing), underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the midface with cheekbones that lack prominence, and a low nasal bridge with narrow nasal passages. The baby's fingers appear short and the ring and middle fingers may diverge, giving the hand a trident (three-pronged) appearance. Most joints can extend more than normal. For example, the knees can hyperextend beyond the normal stopping point. Not all joints are lax in this way. To the contrary, extension and rotation of the elbow are abnormally limited. Hip extension also tends to be limited. At birth there is often prominence of the mid-to-lower back with a small gibbus (a hump). With walking, the hump goes away and a pronounced sway (lordosis) of the lumbar region (the lower back) becomes apparent. The lumbar lordosis is persistent into adulthood.  The legs are bowed (genu varum). The baby exhibits some decrease in muscle tone (hypotonia). Because of the large head, especially compared to rest of the body, and the decreased muscle tone, the child with achondroplasia will run 
""behind schedule"" in reaching the usual motor developmental milestones. The schedule to which an achondroplastic child's development should be compared is not that for all children in the general population, but rather the growth charts and timetable followed by children with achondroplasia. Intelligence is generally normal in patients with achondroplasia. Enlargement of the brain (megalencephaly) is common and normal with achondroplasia."
How is achondroplasia diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of achondroplasia can be based on the typical physical features, the hallmarks of achondroplasia, evident at birth. Characteristic features are also seen by ''X-rays'', ''ultrasound'', and other imaging techniques. With ultrasound imaging, the diagnosis can sometimes be strongly suspected before birth.''The molecular diagnosis of achondroplasia before birth is possible if there is suspicion of the diagnosis or an increased risk (such as when a parent is affected by achondroplasia). In families in which both parents have achondroplasia, ''prenatal diagnosis'' may be particularly useful, the aim being to distinguish fatal homozygous achondroplasia (with two copies of the defective gene) from heterozygous achondroplasia (with one copy of the achondroplasia gene) from normal. Diagnosis before birth is accomplished by examining cells obtained by ''chorionic villus sampling'' (CVS) or ''amniocentesis''.' "
What can be done for patients with achondroplasia?,"'Children and adults with achondroplasia can lead normal lives provided they receive attentive, informed care by their physicians and parents. Considerations in monitoring children with achondroplasia include careful measurements of growth (length/height and weight) and head circumference using curves specially standardized for those with achondroplasia. Knowledgeable pediatric care and periodic orthopedic and neurologic examinations are critical.''When special problems complicate achondroplasia, prompt and expert intervention is important. For example:'   The foramen magnum (the large opening under the skull) may need to be surgically enlarged in cases of severe narrowing (stenosis) and compression of the spinal cord. When this opening is too narrow, the blood vessels and nerves are compressed, which can lead to central apnea (loss of breathing control). This is responsible for the risk of sudden death in infants 
(SIDS) with achondroplasia. The risk of sudden death for infants with achondroplasia is 2% 
to 5%. The back of individuals with achondroplasia can develop a marked sway (lordosis) to the lower back while abnormalities in the mid-back may cause a small hump (kyphosis) in infancy and compression of the spinal cord in adolescence. The spinal cord compression can require surgery to decompress it. Spinal stenosis is the most common medical complication of achondroplasia seen in adulthood. Orthopedic procedures may be performed for lengthening of the limb bones and correction of bowed legs (usually after full growth has been achieved). Surgery (lumbar laminectomy) is also indicated when spinal stenosis (narrowing) causes symptoms, which tends to be evident in young adults. Disproportion between the brain and the base of the skull can sometimes result in hydrocephalus (""water on the brain"") which needs to be promptly detected and treated by placement of a shunt to drain the excess fluid. The large head with achondroplasia increases the chance of bleeding within the baby's head during 
vaginal delivery. This should be taken into account in planning the birth and postnatal care, and Cesarean delivery 
(C-section) may be recommended for a fetus with achondroplasia. The brainstem (which contains a center for controlling respiration) may be compressed in achondroplasia and contribute to abnormal breathing. Pregnant women with achondroplasia should have their babies delivered by cesarean section, due to their characteristically small pelvis, and high risk of birth related trauma. Middle ear infections 
(otitis media) are frequent and can lead to mild to moderate hearing loss. Therefore, ear infections should be readily suspected and promptly and fully treated with antibiotics 
and/or ear tubes. Dental crowding is also common. Teeth should be straightened and, if necessary, removed to alleviate this problem. 
Control of obesity is essential, and obesity can be a significant problem in people with achondroplasia. The excessive weight gain usually occurs during childhood. When obesity is present, the back and joint problems that are characteristic of this condition worsen in severity. The child with achondroplasia must not be allowed to become overweight. Adults with achondroplasia should also monitor and control their weight. Treatment with human growth hormone, which is still considered experimental, has been preliminarily reported to increase the growth rate after treatment, but studies have not yet demonstrated that adult height is increased by this treatment."
How is achondroplasia inherited?,"'Achondroplasia is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait whereby only a single copy of the abnormal gene (mutation) is required to cause achondroplasia. The gene for achondroplasia is fully penetrant, meaning that everyone who possesses it has achondroplasia. No one with the gene escapes achondroplasia. However, there is some variation in the expression of the gene, meaning that children with achondroplasia are not carbon copies of each other, although they may look alike to the untutored eye.''In only about an eighth of cases is the gene inherited from a parent who has achondroplasia. Rather, about seven-eighths of cases are due to a new mutation (a new change in the gene). This means that most cases of achondroplasia occur sporadically (out of the blue) and are the result of a new mutation in a sperm or ovum of one of the normal- appearing parents. The chance of a new mutation rises with the age of the father. As early as 1912 it was noted that sporadic (new) cases were more often last-born than first-born children. This fits with the fact that the chance of an achondroplastic birth has been shown to increase with paternal age (age of the father).' "
What if someone with achondroplasia has children?,"'Although most children with achondroplasia do not have an achondroplastic parent but have a new mutant gene for achondroplasia, they can still transmit the gene to their children, and the risk for passing that gene down to a child is 50% in each ''pregnancy''.' "
What if two people with achondroplasia have children?,"'People with achondroplasia sometimes have children together. If so, each parent has a 50:50 chance of passing on the gene. Thus, with each ''conception'', there is a 25% chance for an average-size child, a 50% chance for a child (like them) with achondroplasia and a 25% chance for a conception with two achondroplasia genes. The combined presence of two genes for achondroplasia (called homozygous achondroplasia) causes a grievous skeletal disorder that leads to early death from breathing failure due to constriction by a tiny chest cage and neurologic problems from ''hydrocephalus''.' "
What gene causes achondroplasia?,"'Achondroplasia is caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene which codes for a protein (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) that is important for the maintenance of bone and brain tissues. Two specific mutations in this gene are responsible for almost all cases of achondroplasia. These mutations limit the process of ossification, or the formation of bone from cartilage. The FGFR3 gene is located on the short (p) arm of chromosome 4 in chromosome band 4p16.3.' "
What is campomelic dysplasia?,"'Campomelic dysplasia is a severe disorder that affects the development of the skeleton and reproductive system. This condition is often life-threatening in the ''newborn'' period. The term ""campomelic"" comes from the Greek words for ""bent limb."" Affected individuals are typically born with bowing of the long bones in the legs, and they are occasionally born with bowing in the arms. Bowing can cause characteristic skin dimples to form over the curved bone, especially on the lower legs. People with campomelic dysplasia also usually have short legs, dislocated hips, underdeveloped shoulder blades, 11 pairs of ribs instead of 12, bone abnormalities in the neck, and ''feet'' that are abnormally rotated (clubfeet). When affected individuals have features of this disorder but do not have bowed limbs, they are said to have acampomelic campomelic dysplasia.''Many people with campomelic dysplasia have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous genitalia). Approximately 75 percent of affected individuals with a typical male chromosome pattern (46,XY) have ambiguous genitalia or normal female genitalia. Internal reproductive organs may not correspond with the external genitalia; they can be male (testes), female (ovaries), or a combination of the two.''Affected individuals have distinctive facial features, including a small chin, prominent eyes, and a flat face. They also have a large head compared to their body size. A particular group of physical features, called Pierre-Robin sequence, is common in people with campomelic dysplasia. Pierre-Robin sequence includes an opening in the roof of the mouth (a ''cleft palate''), a tongue that is placed further back than normal (glossoptosis), and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). People with campomelic dysplasia are often born with weakened cartilage that forms the upper respiratory tract. This abnormality, called laryngotracheomalacia, partially blocks the ''airway'' and causes difficulty ''breathing''. Laryngotracheomalacia contributes to the poor survival of infants with campomelic dysplasia.''Only a few people with campomelic dysplasia survive past infancy. As these individuals age, they may develop an abnormal curvature of the spine (''scoliosis'') and other spine abnormalities that compress the spinal cord. People with campomelic dysplasia may also have ''short stature'' and ''hearing loss''.' "
How common is campomelic dysplasia?,"'The prevalence of campomelic dysplasia is uncertain; estimates range from 1 in 40,000 to 200,000 births.' "
What genes are related to campomelic dysplasia?,"'Mutations in or near the SOX9 gene cause campomelic dysplasia. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of many different tissues and organs during embryonic development. The SOX9 protein regulates the activity of other genes, especially those that are important for development of the skeleton and reproductive organs.''Most cases of campomelic dysplasia are caused by mutations within the SOX9 gene. These mutations prevent the production of the SOX9 protein or result in a protein with impaired function. About 5 percent of cases are caused by chromosome abnormalities that occur around the SOX9 gene. These chromosome abnormalities disrupt regions of DNA that normally regulate the activity of the SOX9 gene. All of these genetic changes prevent the SOX9 protein from properly controlling the genes essential for normal development of the skeleton, reproductive system, and other parts of the body. Abnormal development of these structures causes the signs and symptoms of campomelic dysplasia.' "
How do people inherit campomelic dysplasia?,"'Campomelic dysplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new mutations in or near the SOX9 gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Rarely, affected individuals inherit a chromosome abnormality from a parent who may or may not show mild signs and symptoms of campomelic dysplasia.' "
What other names do people use for campomelic dysplasia?, Campomelic dwarfism Campomelic syndrome Camptomelic dysplasia
What is osteoporosis?,"'Osteoporosis is a medical condition that is characterized by bones that are less dense than, and thus not as strong as, normal bone. Osteoporosis increases the risk of breaking a bone (fracture) with even minor ''trauma'', such as a fall from standing height, or even from a ''cough'' or sneeze. Unfortunately, people often do not realize they have osteoporosis until either they have a fracture or have a screening test ordered by their doctor to check for osteoporosis. Osteoporosis and low bone mass affect an estimated 44 million Americans. Of those, 10 million have osteoporosis, and the remaining 34 million have a lower than normal bone mass (medically termed ''osteopenia'') and are at higher risk of developing osteoporosis. Women are four times more likely to develop osteoporosis than men. Other health risk factors include older age, family history of osteoporosis, small and thin stature, inactive lifestyle, ''smoking'', ''alcohol'', and use of certain medications, including steroids.' "
How does osteoporosis occur?,"'In order to understand the role of bone mineral density scanning, it is important to know about how osteoporosis occurs. Bone is a living tissue and is constantly being remodeled. This is the natural, healthy state of continuous uptake of old bone (resorption) followed by the deposit of new bone. This turnover is important in keeping bones healthy and in repairing any minor damage that may occur with wear and tear. The cells that lay new bone down are called osteoblasts, and the cells responsible for resorption of old bone are called osteoclasts. Osteoporosis occurs as a result of a mismatch between osteoclast and osteoblast activity. This mismatch can be caused by many different disease states or hormonal changes. It is also commonly a result of ''aging'', change in normal hormones as occurs after ''menopause'', and with diets low in calcium and ''vitamin D''. In osteoporosis, osteoclasts outperform osteoblasts so that more bone is taken up than is laid down. The result is a thinning of the bone with an accompanying loss in bone strength and a greater risk of fracture. A thinning bone results in a lower bone density or bone mass.''There are two major types of bone. Cancellous bone (also known as trabecular bone) is the inner, softer portion of the bone, and cortical bone is the outer, harder layer of bone. Cancellous bone undergoes turnover at a faster rate than cortical bone. As a result, if osteoclast and osteoblast activity become mismatched, cancellous bone is affected more rapidly than cortical bone. Certain areas in the body have a higher ratio of cancellous bone to cortical bone such as the spine (vertebrae), the wrist (distal radius), and the hips (femoral neck).'""Most of a person's bone mass is achieved by early adulthood. After that time, the bone mass gradually declines throughout the rest of a person's life. There is a normal rate of decline in bone mass with age in both men and women. For women, in addition to age, the ""'menopause transition'' itself causes an extra degree of bone loss. This bone loss is greatest in the first three to six years after ''menopause''. Women can lose up to 20% of the total bone mass during this time. Since women generally have a lower bone mass to begin with in comparison with men, the ultimate result is a higher risk of fracture in postmenopausal women as compared to men of the same age. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that men may also be at risk for osteoporosis, especially if they have certain illnesses, a ''low testosterone'' level, are ''smokers'', take certain medications, or are sedentary. The best method to prevent osteoporosis is to achieve as high a bone mass by early adulthood with a proper ''diet'' and regular ''exercise'"". Unfortunately, osteoporosis is not often considered during this time in a person's life."" "
What is bone mineral density (BMD)?,"'The absolute amount of bone as measured by bone mineral density (BMD) testing generally correlates with bone strength and its ability to bear weight. The BMD is measured with a dual energy low-dose X-ray absorptiometry test (referred to as a DXA scan). By measuring BMD, it is possible to predict fracture risk in the same manner that measuring blood pressure can help predict the risk of ''stroke''.''It is important to remember that BMD testing cannot predict the certainty of developing a fracture. It can only predict risk. It is also important to note that a bone density scan, or test, should not be confused with a ''bone scan'', which is a nuclear medicine test in which a radioactive tracer is injected that is used to detect tumors, ''cancer'', ''fractures'', and infections in the bone.'""The World Health Organization has developed definitions for low bone mass (osteopenia) and osteoporosis. These definitions are based on a T-score. The T-score is a measure of how dense a patient's bone is compared to a normal, healthy 30-year-old adult.""'Normal'': A bone BMD is considered normal if the T-score is within 1 standard deviation of the normal young adult value. Thus a T-score between 0 and -1 is considered a normal result. A T-score below -1 is considered an abnormal result.''Low bone mass (medically termed osteopenia)'': A BMD defines osteopenia as a T-score between -1 and -2.5. This signifies an increased fracture risk but does not meet the criteria for osteoporosis.''Osteoporosis'': A BMD more than 2.5 standard deviations from the normal (T score less than or equal to -2.5) defines osteoporosis.''Based on the above medical criteria, it is estimated that 40% of all postmenopausal Caucasian women have osteopenia and that an additional 7% have osteoporosis.' "
Who invented the bone density scan?,"'The bone density scan was invented by the late John R. Cameron (1922-2005), professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. He earned a PhD in physics. He invented bone densitometry in the late 1960s. Bone densitometry, which uses precise, very small ''radiation'' measurements to determine the mineral content of bone, was one of his many important contributions to medical physics.' "
Who performs bone density scans?,"'Bone density scans, or DXA scans, are performed by a trained technician using a DXA machine. The results are then interpreted by a physician. Many different specialist interpret bone density scans, including radiologists, endocrinologists, ''rheumatologists'', gynecologists, and internists.' "
Where is a bone density test done?,"""Bone density tests can be done in a physician's office or in a radiology center in or out of the hospital where other tests such as mammograms, ""'CT scans'', and ''X-rays'' are performed.' "
What information is on a DXA report?,"'There is some variation in DXA reports depending on the facility performing the test. All reports should include the following:' The date of the test, location, and medical equipment used for the test (manufacturer and model of the densitometer) The reason the test was performed The overall diagnosis (normal bone density, osteopenia, or osteoporosis) based on the results of the scan It should mention the results of the test at each site tested. The hip and lumbar spine are always tested. Many medical facilities also measure bone density at the forearm. The bone density is usually reported with three different numbers. First, the actual bone density is reported. This is measured in grams per centimeter squared (g/cm2). Because the exact bone density varies based on the manufacturer and model of the densitometer, the bone density is also reported as a T-score and a Z-score. The T-score is a measure of how dense a patient's bone is compared to a normal, healthy 30-year-old adult. The Z-score is a measure of how dense a patient's bone is compared to the average person of the same age and gender. Comparison of the bone density to any prior tests performed at the same medical facility Many reports include a calculation estimate of the patient's risk of bone fracture based on the results of the bone density scan. This is reported as the risk over the following 10 years of breaking a bone. Some reports also include a vertebral fracture assessment, which uses the DXA to see if there are any bones in the spine that have already fractured. A notation suggesting how long before a follow-up test is needed"
Why is bone mineral density measurement important?,"""Determining a person's BMD helps a health care professional decide if a person is at increased risk for osteoporosis-related fracture. The purpose of BMD testing is to help predict the risk of future fracture so that the treatment program can be optimized. The information from a BMD is used to aid a decision as to whether nonprescription and/or prescription medicine therapy is needed to help reduce the risk of fracture. Additionally, if a patient has a fracture or is planning orthopedic surgery, a diagnosis of osteoporosis might affect the surgical plan. A fracture that could potentially heal in a cast with normal bone mass might require either a longer period of casting or even surgery if the patient has osteoporosis. Sometimes spinal surgeons treat patients with low bone density with bone building medication prior to surgery in order to improve the surgical outcome of bone that is operated on."" "
What is the relationship between BMD and fracture risk?,"'In patients with low bone mass at the hip or the spine (the two areas traditionally measured with DXA [formerly referred to as DEXA] scanning), there is a two- to threefold increase in the incidence of any osteoporotic fracture. In other words, low bone density at the measured areas of the spine and hip can even predict future osteoporotic fractures at other parts of the body besides the spine and hip. In subjects with a BMD in the osteoporosis range, there is approximately a five times increase in the occurrence of osteoporotic fractures.' "
Who should have BMD testing?,"'BMD testing is recommended for all women over the age of 65. Additionally, postmenopausal women under 65 years who have risk factors for osteoporosis other than ''menopause'' (these include a previous history of fractures, low body weight, ''cigarette smoking'', and a family history of fractures) should be tested. Finally, men or women with strong risk factors as listed below should discuss the benefit of DXA scanning with their health care professional to see if testing is indicated.''The following are potential risk factors for osteoporosis that might suggest the need for DXA scanning:' Personal history of fracture as an adult History of fracture in first-degree relative Low body weight or thin body stature Advanced age Current cigarette smoking Use of corticosteroid therapy for more than three months Impaired vision Estrogen deficiency at early age Dementia Poor health/frailty Recent falls Lifelong low calcium intake Low physical activity Alcohol intake of more than two drinks/day Thyroid disease Rheumatoid arthritis Excessive caffeine consumption Use of oral contraceptive (birth control pills)"
How is BMD measured?,"""Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, or DXA, is the most common method to measure a patient's BMD. DXA, or densitometry, is relatively easy to perform and the amount of radiation exposure is low. A DXA scanner is a machine that produces two X-ray beams, each with different energy levels. One beam is high energy while the other is low energy. The amount of X-rays that pass through the bone is measured for each beam. This will vary depending on the thickness of the bone. Based on the difference between the two X-ray beams, the bone density can be measured. The radiation exposure from a DXA scan is actually much less than that from a traditional ""'chest X-ray''.''At present, DXA scanning gives information on the BMD two main areas, the hip and spine. Another bone that is often evaluated is the bone of the forearm. Although osteoporosis involves the whole body, measurements of BMD at one site can be predictive of fractures at other sites. Scanning generally takes 10 to 20 minutes to complete and is painless. The patient needs to be able to lie still on the table during the testing. There is no IV or other injection needed for this test. In preparation for a DXA, on the day of the test, you may eat a normal meal, but you should not take any ''calcium supplements'' for 24 hours prior to the test.''Certain conditions can alter the results of the DXA scan, making result less reliable. These include a lumbar spinal deformity (''scoliosis''), extensive ''degenerative arthritis'', a large amount of calcium in the blood vessels (''atherosclerosis''), or multiple fractures. These conditions can falsely elevate the measured BMD with the DXA scan.' "
What are other methods of measuring BMD?,"'There are small DXA scanners called peripheral DXA machines. These machines often measure BMD at the heel (calcaneus), shin bone (distal tibia), or kneecap (''patella''). Regular DXA machines have a standard reference (called NHANES III) that can be used for all machines, no matter the manufacturer. However, peripheral DXA machines do not yet have a uniform reference standard for the normal peak young adult bone mass that can apply to all machines and all manufacturers. This is necessary for peripheral DXA to be ready for more widespread use. Efforts are in progress to make the peripheral DXA technique more standardized. At present, it is best used as a screening test to consider whether or not a patient would benefit from further bone density testing.''Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) can be used to assess BMD. A standard CT scanner is used in this method. However, the amount of radiation exposure is higher than with DXA and the cost is greater. For these reasons, QCT is not in general clinical use.''Ultrasound'"" is a relatively new diagnostic tool to measure BMD. There is no radiation source with this procedure. An ultrasound beam is directed at the area being analyzed. The scattering and absorption of the waves allow for an assessment of bone density. The results are not as precise as with the other methods mentioned. This technique is relatively new, and there is considerable research being conducted in this area. Since ultrasounds can easily be performed in a physician's office, this method may become valuable for screening larger populations if its accuracy becomes more refined. If the BMD is low on the ultrasound test, you might be asked to have a DXA scan to confirm the results.""'New techniques that are being developed to measure both the BMD and even the quality of the bone are micro CT and MR, which use technologies related to CT and ''MRI'' scans. These are not yet available for clinical use.' "
How often should DXA scans be repeated to monitor treatment?,"'The frequency of monitoring osteoporosis treatment using DXA scans is highly controversial. Some health care professionals recommend DXA scanning at one- to two-year intervals to monitor changes in bone density during treatment. But recent scientific evidence questions the usefulness of such interval monitoring. Reasons why repeating bone density scans is extremely tricky include:' Bone density changes so slowly that the changes may be smaller than the measurement error of the machine. In other words, repeat DXA scans cannot distinguish between a ""real"" increase in bone density or a mere variation in measurement from the machine itself. Typically, BMD changes 1% per year, which is less than the error of a DXA machine (usually in the range of 3%). Changes of less than 2%-4% in the vertebrae and 3%-6% at the hip from test to test can be due to the precision error of the method. Whereas the real purpose of prescription osteoporosis treatment is to decrease future bone fractures, there is no good correlation between increases in bone density as measured by DXA with decreases in fracture risks with treatment. There are multiple examples of this in recent clinical studies. For example, the improvement in BMD only accounted for 4% of the reduction in spine fracture risk with raloxifene (Evista), 16% of the reduction in spine fracture risk with alendronate (Fosamax), and 18% of the reduction in spine fracture risk with risedronate (Actonel, Atelvia). Thus, improvement in BMD does not indicate the amount of the antifracture benefit of osteoporosis medication. Prescription medication may decrease a person's risk of fracture even when there is no apparent increase in BMD. Physicians and nonphysicians alike are often surprised to learn this information! Even if the DXA scan shows continued deterioration in bone density during treatment, no research data exists demonstrating that changing a medication, combining medications, or increasing medication doses will be safe and helpful in decreasing the future risk of fractures compared to just continuing the same medication. Even if a person's bone density deteriorates during treatment, it is quite likely that the person would have lost even more bone density without treatment. Recent research has shown that women who lose bone density after the first year of menopausal hormone therapy will gain bone density in the next two years, whereas women who gain in the first year will tend to lose density in the next two years of therapy. Therefore, bone density during treatment naturally fluctuates and may not be indicative of the fracture protection of the medication."
What is the cost of DXA?,"'The cost for DXA scanning varies depending on insurance policies and coverage. In general, a patient without health care coverage paying cash can expect to pay approximately $200-$300 U.S. for the procedure.' "
What about the accuracy of BMD testing in the doctor's office using smaller equipment?,"""There are several devices that are smaller than the standard DXA scanners that are being used in health care professional's offices to screen for low bone density. Very little scientific data is available about these smaller units. Most of the information comes directly from the equipment manufacturers themselves. Many of these models test peripheral bones in the ""'feet'' or hands. Other units use ''ultrasonography''. These techniques can be less accurate than BMD testing performed with state of the art equipment. Additionally, office-testing equipment can range dramatically in price and quality.''In general, these devices may be reasonable to measure overall fracture risk but are not useful in monitoring therapy. Their use might be limited to screening and results would require confirmation using DXA. In addition, expertise in using the equipment and interpreting the data can vary. At present, it is difficult to comment on these other methods of BMD testing. Interpretation of the results of these tests may be more difficult and not as reliable as the standard DXA scan. Some doctors use these as screening tools and recommend more formal DXA testing if they are abnormal.' "
Summary,"'Osteoporosis is a disease that results in a significant risk of fracture. The consequences of fracture can include hospitalization, immobility, a decrease in the quality of life, and even death.''From a larger perspective, it is a costly disease in terms of the health-care system and time lost from work. Early detection and therapy is the mainstay for trying to prevent these complications. BMD testing results correlate well with the risk of fracture, and the testing is easily performed in a time-efficient manner without any discomfort. Although many methods of BMD testing exist, the best currently is DXA scanning. It is imperative that testing ultimately be done using state-of-the-art equipment with capable highly trained personnel and a doctor well ''versed'' in interpreting the results.' "
What is dyslexia?,"'Dyslexia has been around for a long time and has been defined in different ways. For example, in 1968, the World Federation of Neurologists defined dyslexia as ""a disorder in children who, despite conventional classroom experience, fail to attain the language skills of reading, writing, and spelling commensurate with their intellectual abilities."" The International Dyslexia Association offers the following definition of dyslexia:''""''Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is neurobiological in origin. It is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. These difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonological component of language that is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction. Secondary consequences may include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede growth of vocabulary and background knowledge.''""\t''Dyslexia is the most common learning disability in children and persists throughout life. The severity of dyslexia can vary from mild to severe. The sooner dyslexia is treated, the more favorable the outcome. However, it is never too late for people with dyslexia to learn to improve their language skills.''Dyslexia can go undetected in the early grades of schooling. Children can become frustrated by the difficulty in learning to read. It is important to note that other problems can disguise dyslexia such as a child may:'   Show signs of depression and low 
	self-esteem Have behavior problems at home, as 
	well as at school that often manifest Become unmotivated and develop a 
	dislike for school, and their success may be jeopardized if the problem 
	remains untreated"
What causes dyslexia?,"""Children with dyslexia have difficulty in learning to read despite traditional instruction, at least average intelligence, and adequate motivation and opportunity to learn. It is thought to be caused by impairment in the brain's ability to process phonemes (the smallest units of speech that make words different from each other). It does not result from vision or hearing problems. It is not due to mental retardation, ""'brain damage'', or a lack of intelligence.'' The causes of dyslexia vary with the type. In primary dyslexia, much research focuses on the hereditary factors.  Researchers have recently identified specific genes identified as possibly contributing to the signs and symptoms of dyslexia.  This research is very important because this may permit the identification of those children at risk for developing dyslexia and allow for earlier educational interventions and better outcomes.'  "
What are the six different types of dyslexia?,"'Here are the three main types of dyslexia.''Other types of learning disability include:' Primary dyslexia: This is the most common type of dyslexia, and is a dysfunction of, rather than damage to, the left side of the brain (cerebral cortex) and does not change with age. There is variability in the severity of the disability for Individuals with this type of dyslexia, and most who receive an appropriate educational intervention will be academically successful throughout their lives. Unfortunately, there are others who continue to struggle significantly with reading, writing, and spelling throughout their adult lives. Primary dyslexia is passed in family lines through genes (hereditary) or through new genetic mutations and it is found more often in boys than in girls. Secondary or developmental dyslexia: This type of dyslexia is caused by problems with brain development during the early stages of fetal development. Developmental dyslexia diminishes as the child matures. It is also more common in boys. Trauma dyslexia: This type of dyslexia usually occurs after some form of brain trauma or injury to the area of the brain that controls reading and writing. It is rarely seen in today's school-age population. The term visual dyslexia is sometimes used to refer to visual processing disorder, a condition in which the brain does not properly interpret visual signals. The term auditory dyslexia has been used to refer to auditory processing disorder. Similar to visual processing disorder, there are problems with the brain's processing of sounds and speech. Dysgraphia refers to the child's difficulty holding and controlling a pencil so that the correct markings can be made on the paper."
What are the signs and symptoms of dyslexia?,"'Classroom teachers may not be able to determine if a child has dyslexia. They may detect early signs that suggest further assessment by a psychologist or other healthcare professional in order to actually diagnose the disorder. ''Signs and symptoms of dyslexia''Auditory problems in dyslexia encompass a variety of functions. ''Many subtle signs can be observed in children with dyslexia. '   Delayed early language development
	 Problems recognizing the 
	differences between similar sounds or segmenting words.  Slow learning of new vocabulary 
	words Difficulty copying from the board 
	or a book.  Difficulty with learning reading, 
	writing, and spelling skills A child may not be able to 
	remember content, even if it involves a favorite video or storybook.  Problems with spatial 
	relationships can extend beyond the classroom and be observed on the 
	playground. The child may appear to be uncoordinated and have difficulty 
	with organized sports or games.  Difficulty with left and right is 
	common, and often dominance for either hand has not been established.  Commonly, a child may have 
	difficulty remembering or understanding what he hears.  Recalling sequences of things or 
	more than one command at a time can be difficult.  Parts of words or parts of whole 
	sentences may be missed, and words can come out sounding funny.  The wrong word or a similar word 
	may be used instead.  Children struggling with this 
	problem may know what they want to say but have trouble finding the actual 
	words to express their thoughts. Children may become withdrawn and 
	appear to be depressed.  They may begin to act out, drawing 
	attention away from their learning difficulty.  Problems with self-esteem can 
	arise, and peer and sibling interactions can become strained.  These children may lose their 
	interest in school-related activities and appear to be unmotivated or lazy.
	 The emotional symptoms and signs 
	are just as important as the academic and require equal attention."
What should parents or caregivers do if they suspect a child has the signs and symptoms of dyslexia?,"""It is important to consult your pediatrician if you are concerned about your child's development. Additionally, meeting with your child's teachers is an important step toward getting more answers.""'Ideally, every school has a team that meets on a regular basis to discuss problems a specific child might be having. These teams are made up of the principal, classroom teacher, and one or a combination of the following depending on the staffing of the school such as ''A parent should always be included as a part of this team. The teams are commonly referred to as '""Any parent or teacher who suspects a learning problem may request a meeting with this team to discuss the child's problem. The parent may request this even if the teacher feels the child is doing well. Sometimes a decision to test the child will be made. The parent or teacher may request testing, but it cannot be done without the parents' written permission.""'If the child attends a private school which lacks the appropriate professionals to evaluate a suspected learning problem, he should be referred to the public-school system for evaluation. If testing is not satisfactorily conducted in the public-school system for private or public school students, the parent will need to locate the appropriate health professionals for assessment. A list of resources is provided at the conclusion of this article.''Because testing can sometimes be stressful for children, especially if they are unhappy about their school performance, alternative strategies are usually tried before testing is done. Once the assessment plan has been discussed with the parent(s) and they have granted permission, the school team completes the testing and holds a meeting with the parent(s) to discuss the test results.''The assessment plan for each child depends on the specific problems the child is having. Each plan should include testing in five areas:  ''The testing will be done by the various members of the school team or the professionals consulted by the parent. Typically, the school or clinical psychologist determines whether or not the child has dyslexia. Since there are different forms of dyslexia, such as learning disability in reading, written language, or math, the psychologist diagnoses the specific type. Another form known as expressive language delay can be diagnosed by a speech therapist.' school psychologist,  nurse,  speech therapist,  reading specialist, and  other pertinent professionals.  Child Study Teams,  Student Study Teams, or  Student Support Teams.  cognition (intelligence),  academic performance,  communication,  sensory/motor, and  health and developmental. "
What tests diagnose dyslexia?,"""Dyslexia is a difficult disorder to diagnose. There are many factors the psychologist or other health professional reviews to diagnose the disability. The testing determines the child's functional reading level and compares it to reading potential, which is evaluated by an intelligence test. All aspects of the reading process are examined to pinpoint where the breakdown is occurring. The testing further assesses how a child takes in and processes information and what the child does with the information. The tests determine whether a child learns better by ""'They also assess whether a child performs better when allowed to give information (output), by saying something (oral), or by doing something with their hands (tactile-kinesthetic). The tests also evaluate how all of these sensory systems (modalities) work in conjunction with each other.''The tests administered are standardized and are considered highly reliable. ''A standard battery of tests can include, but is not limited to, the following:'   hearing information (auditory),  looking at information (visual), or  doing something (kinesthetic).  The child should not feel as if there is something wrong because testing is occurring. 
	 Many of the tests use a game-type or puzzle format which can help make the child feel more comfortable. 
	 Children should get a good night's
	sleep prior to the testing and have a good breakfast. 
	 If the testing is done in a school setting, the teacher can prepare the child by talking about the person who will come and do special work with the child. 
	 With young children, the psychologist may visit the child's classroom before the testing so that the child is familiar with him. 
	 Whether or not the testing is done at school, the parent may want to talk to their child about a new person coming to work with them. However, parents should not try to coach the child concerning the testing. It is recommended that parents not be present during the testing.

What type of treatment is available for dyslexia?,"""Before any treatment is started, an evaluation must be done to determine the child's specific area of disability. While there are many theories about successful treatment for dyslexia, there is no actual cure for it. The school will develop a plan with the parent to meet the child's needs.The plan may be implemented in a special education setting or in the regular classroom. An appropriate treatment plan will focus on strengthening the child's weaknesses while utilizing the strengths. A direct approach may include a systematic study of phonics. Techniques designed to help all the senses work together efficiently can also be used. Computers are powerful tools for these children and should be utilized as much as possible. The child should be taught compensation and coping skills. Attention should be given to optimum learning conditions and alternative avenues for student performance.""'In addition to what the school has to offer, there are alternative treatment options available outside the school setting. Although alternative treatments are commonly recommended, there is limited research supporting the effectiveness of these treatments. In addition, many of these treatments are very costly, and it may be easy for frustrated parents to be misled by something that is expensive and sounds attractive.''Perhaps the most important aspect of any treatment plan is attitude. Children will be influenced by the attitudes of the adults around them. Dyslexia should not become an excuse for a child to avoid written work. Because the academic demands on a child with dyslexia may be great and the child may tire easily, work increments should be broken down into appropriate chunks. Frequent breaks should be built into class and homework time. Reinforcement should be given for efforts as well as achievements. Alternatives to traditional written assignments should be explored and utilized. Teachers are learning to deliver information to students in a variety of ways that are not only more interesting but helpful to students who may learn best by different techniques. Interactive technology is providing interesting ways for students to get feedback on what they have learned, in contrast to traditional paper-pencil tasks.'  "
What is the prognosis for a person with dyslexia?,"""The prognosis for children with dyslexia is variable and dependent on the cause.  In the case of primary dyslexia, the earlier the diagnosis is made and intervention started, the better the outcome. It is also important to focus on the child's self-esteem, since dealing with dyslexia can be extremely frustrating.  Lastly it is important to recognize that many well-known and successful individuals have suffered from dyslexia, including Albert Einstein and Steven Spielberg, just to name a couple."" "

"What is indigestion (dyspepsia, upset stomach)?","'Dyspepsia (indigestion) is best described as a functional disease. (Sometimes, it is called functional dyspepsia.) The concept of functional disease is particularly useful when discussing diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. The concept applies to the muscular organs of the gastrointestinal tract, the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, gallbladder, and colon that are controlled by nerves. What is meant by the term, functional, is that either the muscles of the organs or the nerves that control the organs are not working normally, and, as a result, the organs do not function normally, and the dysfunction causes the symptoms. The nerves that control the organs include not only the nerves that lie within the muscles of the organs but also the nerves of the spinal cord and brain.''Some gastrointestinal diseases can be seen and diagnosed with the naked eye, such as ulcers of the stomach and can be seen at surgery, on ''X-rays'', and by ''endoscopy''. Other diseases cannot be seen with the naked eye but can be seen and diagnosed under the microscope. For example, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach) can be diagnosed by microscopic examination of biopsies of the stomach. In contrast, gastrointestinal functional diseases cannot be seen with the naked eye or the microscope. Accordingly, and by default, functional gastrointestinal diseases are those that involve abnormal function of gastrointestinal organs in which the abnormalities cannot be seen in the organs with either the naked eye or the microscope.''In some instances, the abnormal function can be demonstrated by tests (for example, gastric emptying studies or antro-duodenal motility studies). However, the tests often are complex, are not widely available, and do not reliably detect the functional abnormalities.''Occasionally, diseases that are thought to be functional are ultimately found to be associated with abnormalities that can be seen by the naked eye or under the microscope. Then, the disease moves out of the functional category. An example of this would be '' ''Helicobacter pylori'' (''H. pylori'')'' infection of the stomach. Some patients with mild upper gastrointestinal symptoms who were thought to have abnormal function of the stomach or intestines have been found to have stomachs infected with ''H. pylori''. This infection can be diagnosed under the microscope by identifying the bacterium in biopsies from the stomach. When patients are treated with antibiotics, the ''H. pylori'' and symptoms disappear. Thus, recognition of infections with ''Helicobacter pylori'"" has removed some patients' symptoms from the functional disease category.""""The distinction between functional disease and non-functional disease may, in fact, be blurry. Thus, even functional diseases probably have associated biochemical or molecular abnormalities that ultimately will be able to be measured. For example, functional diseases of the stomach and intestines may be shown ultimately to be associated with reduced or increased levels of normal chemicals within the gastrointestinal organs, the spinal cord, or the brain. Should a disease that is demonstrated to be due to a reduced or increased chemical still be considered a functional disease? In this theoretical situation, we can't see the abnormality with the naked eye or the microscope, but we can measure it. If we can measure an associated or causative abnormality, should the disease no longer be considered functional, even though the disease (symptoms) are being caused by abnormal function? The answer is unclear.""'Despite the shortcomings of the term, functional, the concept of a functional abnormality is useful for approaching many of the symptoms originating from the muscular organs of the gastrointestinal tract. To repeat, this concept applies to those symptoms for which there are no associated abnormalities that can be seen with the naked eye or the microscope.''While dyspepsia is a major functional disease(s), it is important to mention several other functional diseases. A second major functional disease is the ''irritable bowel syndrome'', or ''IBS''. The ''symptoms of IBS'' are thought to originate primarily from the small intestine and/or colon. The symptoms of ''IBS'' include abdominal ''pain'' that is accompanied by alterations in bowel movements (defecation), primarily ''constipation'' or ''diarrhea''. In fact, indigestion and ''IBS'' may be overlapping diseases since up to half of patients with ''IBS'' also have symptoms of indigestion. A third distinct functional disorder is non-cardiac ''chest pain''. This ''pain'' may mimic heart pain (''angina''), but it is unassociated with ''heart disease''. In fact, non-cardiac chest pain is thought to often result from a functional abnormality of the esophagus.''Functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract often are categorized by the organ of involvement. Thus, there are functional disorders of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, and gallbladder. The amount of research that has been done with functional disorders is greatest in the esophagus and stomach (for example, non-cardiac chest pain, indigestion), perhaps because these organs are easiest to reach and study. Research into functional disorders affecting the small intestine and colon (IBS) is more difficult to conduct, and there is less agreement among the research studies. This probably is a reflection of the complexity of the activities of the small intestine and colon and the difficulty in studying these activities. Functional diseases of the gallbladder (referred to as biliary ''dyskinesia''), like those of the small intestine and colon, are more difficult to study, and at present they are less well-defined. Each of the functional diseases is associated with its own set of characteristic symptoms.' "
How common is indigestion?,"'Indigestion is one of the most common ailments of the bowel (intestines), affecting an estimated 20% of persons in the United States. Perhaps only 10% of those affected actually seek medical attention for their indigestion. Indigestion is not a particularly good term for the ailment since it implies that there is ""dyspepsia"" or abnormal ''digestion'' of food, and this most probably is not the case. In fact, another common name for dyspepsia is indigestion, which, for the same reason, is no better than the term dyspepsia! Doctors frequently refer to the condition as non-ulcer dyspepsia to distinguish it from the more common acid or ulcer-related symptoms.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of indigestion or upset stomach?,"'We usually think of symptoms of indigestion as originating from the upper gastrointestinal tract, primarily the stomach and first part of the small intestine. These symptoms include:''The symptoms most often are provoked by eating, which is a time when many different gastrointestinal functions are called upon to work in concert. This tendency to occur after meals is what gave rise to the erroneous notion that indigestion might be caused by an abnormality in the digestion of food.' upper abdominal pain or discomfort (above or around the navel), belching, nausea (with or without vomiting), abdominal bloating (the sensation of abdominal fullness without visible distention), early satiety (the sensation of fullness after a very small amount of food), abdominal distention (visible swelling as opposed to bloating), and lower chest pain."
Abdominal discomfort and excessive air in the stomach,"'Everyone knows that when they have mild abdominal discomfort, belching often relieves the problem. This is because excessive air in the stomach often is the cause of mild abdominal discomfort; as a result, people force belches whenever mild abdominal discomfort is felt, whatever the cause. Unfortunately, if there is no excessive ''gas'' to be expelled, forced belches do nothing more than draw air into the esophagus. Usually this air is expelled during the same belch (referred to as a supradiaphragmatic belch), but the air also may enter the stomach, and itself result in excess gas that must be expelled with additional belching.''If the problem causing the discomfort is not excessive air in the stomach, then belching does not provide relief. As mentioned previously, it even may make the situation worse by increasing air in the stomach. When belching does not ease the discomfort, the belching should be taken as a sign that something may be wrong within the abdomen, and the cause of the discomfort should be sought. Belching by itself, however, does not help the physician determine what may be wrong because belching can occur in virtually any abdominal disease or condition that causes discomfort.' "
Is burping (belching) a symptom of indigestion?,"'It is appropriate to discuss belching in detail since it is a commonly misunderstood symptom associated with indigestion.''Excessive air in the stomach is not the only cause of belching.' The ability to belch is almost universal. Belching, also known as burping or eructating, is the act of expelling gas from the stomach out through the mouth. The usual cause of belching is a distended (inflated) stomach that is caused by swallowed air or gas. The distention of the stomach causes abdominal discomfort, and the belching expels the air and relieves the discomfort. The common reasons for swallowing large amounts of air (aerophagia) or gas aregulping food or drink too rapidly,anxiety, andcarbonated beverages. gulping food or drink too rapidly, anxiety, and carbonated beverages. People often are unaware that they are swallowing air. ""Burping"" infants during bottle or breastfeeding is important in order to expel air in the stomach that has been swallowed with the formula or milk. For some people, belching becomes a habit and does not reflect the amount of air in their stomachs. For others, belching is a response to any type of abdominal discomfort and not just to discomfort due to increased gas."
How long does indigestion (dyspepsia) last?,"'Indigestion is a chronic disease that usually lasts years, if not a lifetime. It does, however, display periodicity, which means that the symptoms may be more frequent or severe for days, weeks, or months and then less frequent or severe for days, weeks, or months. The reasons for these fluctuations are unknown. Because of the fluctuations, it is important to judge the effects of treatment over many weeks or months to be certain that any improvement is due to treatment and not simply to a natural fluctuation in the frequency or severity of the disease.' "
What other non-functional GI diseases mimic indigestion? How are they diagnosed?,"'A detailed history from the patient and a physical examination frequently will suggest the cause of dyspepsia. Routine screening blood tests often are performed looking for clues to unsuspected diseases. Examinations of ''stool'' are a part of the evaluation since they may reveal infection, signs of inflammation, or blood and direct further diagnostic testing. Sensitive ''stool'' testing (antigen/antibody) for ''Giardia lamblia'' would be reasonable because this parasitic infection is common and can be acute or chronic. Some physicians do blood testing for ''celiac disease'' (sprue), but the value of doing this is unclear. (Moreover, if an ''EGD'' is planned, biopsies of the duodenum usually will make the diagnosis of ''celiac disease''.) If bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine is being considered, breath hydrogen testing can be considered.''There are many tests to exclude non-functional gastrointestinal diseases. The primary issue, however, is to decide which tests are reasonable to perform. Since each case is individual, different tests may be reasonable for different patients. Nevertheless, certain basic tests are often performed to exclude non-functional gastrointestinal disease. These tests identify anatomic (structural) and histological (microscopic) diseases of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines.''Both X-rays and endoscopies can identify anatomic diseases. Only endoscopies, however, can diagnose histological diseases because biopsies (samples of tissue) can be taken during the procedure. The X-ray tests include:' The esophagram and video-fluoroscopic swallowing study for examining the esophagus The upper gastrointestinal series for examining the stomach and duodenum The small bowel series for examining the small intestine The barium enema for examining the colon and terminal ileum. The computerized tomography (CT) scan for examining the small intestine"
What causes of indigestion are non-digestive?,"""It's not surprising that many gastrointestinal (GI) diseases have been associated with indigestion. However, many non-GI diseases also have been associated with indigestion. Examples of non-GI causes of indigestion include""'It is not clear, however, how these non-GI diseases might cause indigestion.''Another important cause of indigestion is drugs. Many drugs are frequently associated with indigestion, for example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'' such as ''ibuprofen''), antibiotics, and ''estrogens''). In fact, most drugs are reported to cause indigestion in at least some people with functional symptoms.'   diabetes, thyroid disease, hyperparathyroidism (overactive parathyroid glands), and severe kidney disease."
Antidepressants for indigestion,"'Patients with functional disorders, including indigestion, are frequently found to be suffering from ''depression'' and/or ''anxiety''. It is unclear, however, if the ''depression'' and ''anxiety'' are the cause or the result of the functional disorders or are unrelated to these disorders. (''Depression'' and ''anxiety'' are common and, therefore, their occurrence together with functional disorders may be coincidental.) Several ''clinical trials'' have shown that ''antidepressants'' are effective in IBS in relieving abdominal pain. Antidepressants also have been shown to be effective in unexplained (non-cardiac) chest pain, a condition thought to represent a dysfunction of the esophagus. Antidepressants have not been studied adequately in other types of functional disorders, including indigestion. It probably is reasonable to treat patients with indigestion with psychotropic drugs if they have moderate or severe ''depression'' or anxiety.''The antidepressants work in functional disorders at relatively low doses that have little or no effect on depression. It is believed, therefore, that these drugs work not by combating depression, but in different ways (through different mechanisms). For example, these drugs have been shown to adjust (modulate) the activity of the nerves and to have analgesic (pain-relieving) effects as well.''Commonly used psychotropic drugs include the ''tricyclic antidepressants'', ''desipramine'' (Norpramine) and ''trimipramine'' (''Surmontil''). Although studies are encouraging, it is not yet clear whether the newer class of antidepressants, the serotonin-reuptake inhibitors such as ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), and ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), are effective in functional disorders, including indigestion.' "
Diet and indigestion,"'Dietary factors have not been well-studied in the treatment of indigestion. Nevertheless, people often associate their symptoms with specific foods (such as salads and ''fats''). Although specific foods might worsen the symptoms of indigestion, they usually are not the cause of indigestion. (Intolerance to specific foods, for example, ''lactose intolerance'' [milk] and ''allergies'' to wheat, eggs, ''soy'', and milk protein are not considered functional diseases like indigestion). The common placebo response in functional disorders such as indigestion also may explain the improvement of symptoms in some people with the elimination of specific foods.''Dietary ''fiber'' often is recommended for patients with IBS, but fiber has not been studied in the treatment of indigestion. Nevertheless, it probably is reasonable to treat patients with indigestion with fiber if they also have ''constipation''.''Intolerance to lactose (the ''sugar'' in milk) often is blamed for indigestion. Since indigestion and lactose intolerance both are common, the two conditions may coexist. In this situation, restricting lactose will improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance, but will not affect the symptoms of indigestion. Lactose intolerance is easily determined by a milk challenge testing the effects of lactose (hydrogen breath testing) or trying a strict lactose elimination ''diet''. If lactose is determined to be responsible for some or all of the symptoms, elimination of lactose-containing foods is appropriate. Unfortunately, many patients stop drinking milk or eating milk-containing foods without good evidence that it improves their symptoms. This often is detrimental to their intake of calcium which may contribute to ''osteoporosis''.'""One of the food substances most commonly associated with the symptoms of indigestion is fat. The scientific evidence that fat causes indigestion is weak. Most of the support is anecdotal (not based on carefully done, scientific studies). Nevertheless, fat is one of the most potent influences on gastrointestinal function. (It tends to slow down the gastrointestinal muscles while it causes the muscles of the gallbladder to contract.) Therefore, it is possible that fat may worsen indigestion even though it doesn't cause it. Moreover, reducing the ingestion of fat might relieve symptoms. A strict low fat ""'diet'' can be accomplished fairly easily and is worth trying. Additionally, there are other health-related reasons for reducing dietary fat.''Other dietary factors, fructose, and other ''sugar''-related foods (fermentable, oligo- di- and ''mono''-saccharides and polyols or ''FODMAPs''), have been suggested as a cause of indigestion since many people do not fully digest and absorb them before they reach the distal intestine. Fructose intolerance and perhaps also ''FODMAP'' intolerance can be diagnosed with a ''hydrogen breath test'' using fructose and treated by elimination of fructose and/or FODMAP containing foods from the diet. Unfortunately, fructose and FODMAPs are widespread among fruits and vegetables, and fructose is found in high concentrations in many food products sweetened with ''corn'' syrup. Thus, an elimination diet can be difficult to maintain.' "
Pro-motility medication for indigestion,"'One of the leading theories for the cause of indigestion is abnormalities in the way gastrointestinal muscles function. The function of muscles may be abnormally increased, abnormally decreased, or it may by uncoordinated. There are medications, called smooth muscle relaxants that can reduce the activity of the muscles and other drugs that can increase the activity of the muscles, called promotility drugs.''Many of the symptoms of indigestion can be explained on the basis of reduced activity of the gastrointestinal muscles that results in slowed transport (transit) of food through the stomach and intestine. (It is clear, as discussed previously, that there are other causes of these symptoms in addition to slowed transit.) Such symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating. When transit is severely affected, abdominal distention (swelling) also may occur and can result in abdominal pain. (Early satiety is unlikely to be a function of slowed transit because it occurs too early for slowed transit to have consequences.) Theoretically, drugs that speed up the transit of food should, in at least some patients, relieve symptoms of indigestion that are due to slow transit.''The number of promotility drugs that are available for use clinically is limited. Studies of their effectiveness in indigestion are even more limited. The most studied drug is cisapride (Propulsid), a promotility drug that was withdrawn from the market because of serious cardiac side effects. (Newer drugs that have similar effects but lack the toxicity are being developed.) The few studies with cisapride for indigestion were inconsistent in their results. Some studies demonstrated benefits whereas others showed no benefit. Cisapride was effective in patients with severe emptying problems of the stomach (''gastroparesis'') or severely slowed transit of food through the small intestine (chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction). These two diseases may or may not be related to indigestion.''Another promotility drug that is available is ''erythromycin'', an antibiotic that stimulates gastrointestinal smooth muscle as one of its side effects. Erythromycin is used to stimulate smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract at doses that are lower than those used for treating infections. There are no studies of erythromycin in indigestion, but erythromycin is effective in gastroparesis and probably also in chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.''Metoclopramide'' (''Reglan'') is another promotility drug that is available. It has not been studied, however, in indigestion. Moreover, it is associated with some troubling side effects. Therefore, it may not be a good drug to undergo further testing in indigestion.''Domperidone'' (Motilium) is a promotility drug that is available in the U.S., but requires a special permit from the US Food and Drug administration. As a result, it is not very commonly prescribed. It is an effective drug with minimal side effects.' "
How do you know if you have indigestion (diagnosis)?,"'Indigestion is diagnosed primarily based on typical symptoms and the exclusion of non-functional gastrointestinal diseases (including acid-related diseases), non-gastrointestinal diseases, and psychiatric illness. There are tests for identifying abnormal gastrointestinal function directly, but they are limited in their ability to do so.' "
What natural or home remedies are used to treat dyspepsia (indigestion)?,"'Studies of natural and home remedies for indigestion are few. Most recommendations for natural and home remedies have little evidence to support their use. Several potential remedies, however, deserve mention including:' Acid-suppressing remedies: The most common cause of dyspepsia is probably gastrointestinal reflux disease (acid reflux or GERD). That may be why remedies such as baking soda, which neutralizes stomach acid, have been recommended. Even if baking soda works, it is more effective (and probably safer) to use antacids in liquid or pill form for this purpose. Ginger: Ginger has been demonstrated to relieve nausea. One small study showed it to be ineffective in relieving dyspepsia, but ginger is harmless and worth a try if nausea is a component of the dyspepsia. Peppermint: Peppermint has been demonstrated to have effects on the function of the gastrointestinal tract; it is among the most potent inhibitors of intestinal muscles. It is effective in another functional disease, irritable bowel syndrome, but there is minimal evidence that it is effective in dyspepsia. Nevertheless, like ginger, it is harmless and worth a try. Meals: Eating smaller, more frequent meals. Lifestyle changes: Stay away from specific foods and drinks, smoking, and alcohol if they provoke symptoms."
What treatments relieve and cure indigestion (dyspepsia)?,"'The treatment of indigestion is a difficult and unsatisfying topic because so few drugs have been studied and have been shown to be effective. Moreover, the drugs that have been shown to be effective have not been shown to be very effective. This difficult situation exists for many reasons including:''The lack of understanding of the physiologic processes (mechanisms) that cause indigestion has meant that treatment usually cannot be directed at the mechanisms. Instead, treatment usually is directed at the symptoms. For example, nausea is treated with medications that suppress nausea but do not affect the cause of the nausea. On the other hand, the psychotropic drugs (antidepressants) and psychological treatments (such as ''cognitive behavioral therapy'') treat hypothetical causes of indigestion (for example, abnormal function of sensory nerves and the psyche) rather than causes or even the symptoms. Treatment for indigestion often is similar to that for ''irritable bowel'' syndrome (IBS) even though the causes of IBS and indigestion are likely to be different.'""It is important to educate patients with indigestion about their illness, particularly by reassuring them that the illness is not a serious threat to their physical health (though it may be to their emotional health). Patients need to understand the potential causes for the symptoms. Most importantly, they need to understand the medical approach to the problem and the reasons for each test or treatment. Education prepares patients for a potentially prolonged course of diagnosis and trials of treatment. Education also may prevent patients from falling prey to the charlatans who offer unproven and possibly dangerous treatments for indigestion. Many symptoms are tolerable if patients' anxieties about the seriousness of their symptoms can be relieved. It also helps patients deal with symptoms when they feel that everything that should be done to diagnose and treat, in fact, is being done. The truth is that psychologically healthy people can tolerate a good deal of discomfort and continue to lead happy and productive lives."" Life-threatening illnesses (for example, cancer, heart disease, and high blood pressure) are the illnesses that capture the public's interest and, more importantly, research funding. Indigestion is not a life-threatening illness and has received little research funding. Because of the lack of research, an understanding of the physiologic processes (mechanisms) that are responsible for indigestion has been slow to develop. Effective drugs cannot be developed until there is an understanding of these mechanisms. Research in indigestion is difficult. Indigestion is defined by subjective symptoms (such as pain) rather than objective signs (for example, the presence of an ulcer). Subjective symptoms are more unreliable than objective signs in identifying homogenous groups of patients. As a result, groups of patients with indigestion who are undergoing treatment are likely to contain some patients who do not have indigestion, which may dilute (negatively affect) the results of the treatment. Moreover, the results of treatment must be evaluated on the basis of subjective responses (such as improvement of pain). In addition to being more unreliable, subjective responses are more difficult to measure than objective responses (for example, healing of an ulcer). Different subtypes of indigestion (for example, abdominal pain and abdominal bloating) are likely to be caused by different physiologic processes (mechanisms). It also is possible, however, that the same subtype of indigestion may be caused by different mechanisms in different people. What's more, any drug is likely to affect only one mechanism. Therefore, it is unlikely that any one medication can be effective in all-even most-patients with indigestion, even patients with similar symptoms. This inconsistent effectiveness makes the testing of drugs particularly difficult. Indeed, it can easily result in drug trials that demonstrate no efficacy (usefulness) when, in fact, the drug is helping a subgroup of patients. Subjective symptoms are particularly prone to responding to placebos (inactive drugs). In fact, in most studies, 20% to 40% of patients with indigestion will improve if they receive placebo drugs. Now, all clinical trials of drugs for indigestion require a placebo-treated group for comparison with the drug-treated group. The large placebo response means that these clinical trials must utilize large numbers of patients to detect meaningful (significant) differences in improvement between the placebo and drug groups. Therefore, these trials are expensive to conduct."
Smooth muscle relaxants for indigestion,"'The most widely studied drugs for the treatment of abdominal pain in functional disorders are a group of drugs called smooth-muscle relaxants.''The gastrointestinal tract is primarily composed of a type of muscle called smooth muscle. (By contrast, skeletal muscles such as the biceps are composed of a type of muscle called striated muscle.) Smooth muscle relaxant drugs reduce the strength of contraction of the smooth muscles but do not affect the contraction of other types of muscles. They are used in functional disorders, particularly IBS, with the assumption (not proven) that strong or prolonged contractions of smooth muscles in the intestine-spasms-are the cause of the pain in functional disorders. There are even smooth muscle relaxants that are placed under the tongue, as is ''nitroglycerin'' for angina, so that they may be absorbed rapidly.''There are not enough studies of smooth muscle relaxants in indigestion to conclude that they are effective at reducing pain. Since their side effects are few, these drugs probably are worth trying. As with all drugs that are given to control symptoms, patients should carefully evaluate whether or not the smooth muscle relaxant they are using is effective at controlling the symptoms. If it is not clearly effective, the option of discontinuing the relaxant should be discussed with a physician.''Commonly used smooth muscle relaxants are ''hyoscyamine'' (''Levsin'', ''Anaspaz'', ''Cystospaz'', ''Donnamar'') and methscopolamine (''Pamine'', ''Pamine Forte''). Other drugs combine smooth muscle relaxants with a sedative ''chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide'' (''Donnatal'', ''Librax''), but there is no evidence that the addition of ''sedatives'' adds to the effectiveness of the treatment.' "
Psychological treatments for indigestion,"'Psychological treatments include cognitive-behavioral therapy, hypnosis, psychodynamic or interpersonal ''psychotherapy'', and relaxation/''stress management''. Few studies of psychological treatments have been conducted in indigestion, although more studies have been done in IBS. Thus, there is little scientific evidence that they are effective in indigestion, although there is some evidence that they are effective in IBS.''Hypnosis has been proposed as an effective treatment for IBS. It is unclear exactly how effective hypnosis is, or how it works.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat indigestion (dyspepsia)?,"'Since indigestion is very common, almost all doctors see and treat patients with indigestion, especially family practitioners, internists and even pediatricians. If these generalists are unable to provide adequate treatment, the patient usually is referred to a ''gastroenterologist'', an internist or pediatrician with specialty training in gastrointestinal diseases.' "
What are the complications of indigestion (dyspepsia)?,"'The complications of functional diseases of the gastrointestinal tract are relatively limited. Since symptoms are most often provoked by eating, patients who alter their diets and reduce their intake of calories may ''lose weight''. However, loss of weight is unusual in functional diseases. In fact, loss of weight should suggest the presence of non-functional diseases. Symptoms that awaken patients from ''sleep'' also are more likely to be due to non-functional than functional disease.'""Most commonly, functional diseases interfere with patients' comfort and daily activities. Individuals who develop nausea or pain after eating may skip breakfast or lunch because of the symptoms they experience. Patients also commonly associate symptoms with specific foods (for example, milk, fat, vegetables). Whether or not the associations are real, these patients will restrict their diets accordingly. Milk is the most common food that is eliminated, often unnecessarily, and this can lead to inadequate intake of calcium and ""'osteoporosis''. The interference with daily activities also can lead to problems with interpersonal relationships, especially with spouses. Most patients with functional disease live with their symptoms and infrequently visit physicians for diagnosis and treatment.'  "
What can a person expect during the diagnosis and treatment of indigestion (prognosis)?,"""The initial approach to dyspepsia, whether it be treatment or testing, depends on the patient's age, symptoms and the duration of the symptoms. If the patient is younger than 50 years of age and serious disease, particularly ""'cancer'', is not likely, testing is less important. If the symptoms are typical for dyspepsia and have been present for many years without change, then there is less need for testing, or at least extensive testing, to exclude other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases.''On the other hand, if the symptoms are of recent onset (weeks or months), progressively worsening, severe, or associated with ""warning"" signs, then early, more extensive testing is appropriate. Warning signs include loss of weight, nighttime awakening, ''blood in the stool'' or the material that is vomited (vomitus), and signs of inflammation, such as ''fever'' or abdominal tenderness. Testing also is appropriate if, in addition to symptoms of dyspepsia, there are other prominent symptoms that are not commonly associated with dyspepsia.''If there are symptoms that suggest conditions other than dyspepsia, tests that are specific for these diseases should be done first. The reason is that if these other tests disclose other diseases, it may not be necessary to do additional testing. Examples of such symptoms and possible testing include:''For a patient with typical symptoms of dyspepsia who requires testing to exclude other diseases, a standard screening panel of blood tests would reasonably be included. These tests might reveal clues to non-gastrointestinal diseases. Sensitive stool testing (antigen/antibody) for ''Giardia'' lamblia would be reasonable because this parasitic infection is common and can be acute or chronic. Some physicians do blood testing for ''celiac disease'' (sprue), but the value of doing this is unclear. Moreover, if an EGD is planned, biopsies of the duodenum usually will make the diagnosis of ''celiac disease'"". A plain X-ray of the abdomen might be done during an episode of abdominal pain (to look for intestinal blockage or obstruction). Testing for lactose intolerance or a trial of a strict lactose-free diet should be considered. The physician's clinical judgment should determine the extent to which initial testing is appropriate.""'Once testing has been done to an extent that is appropriate for the clinical situation, it is reasonable to first try a therapeutic trial of stomach acid suppression to see if symptoms improve. Such a trial probably should involve a PPI (proton pump inhibitor) for 8 to 12 weeks. If there is no clear response of symptoms, the options then are to discontinue the PPI or confirm its effectiveness in suppressing acid with 24 hour acid testing. If there is a clear and substantial decrease in symptoms with the PPI, then decisions need to be made about continuing acid suppression and which drugs to use.''Another therapeutic approach is to test for ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection of the stomach (with blood, breath or stool tests) and to treat patients with infection to eradicate the infection. It may be necessary to retest patients after treatment to prove that treatment has effectively eradicated the infection, particularly if dyspeptic symptoms persist after treatment.''If treatment with a PPI has satisfactorily suppressed acid according to acid testing (or acid suppression has not been measured) and yet the symptoms have not improved, it is reasonable to conduct further testing as described above. Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy, or EGD, (and, possibly, ''colonoscopy'') would be the next consideration, probably with multiple biopsies of the stomach and duodenum (and colon if colonoscopy is done). Finally, small intestinal x-rays and an ''ultrasound'' examination of the gallbladder might be done. An abdominal ultrasound examination, ''CT scan'', or ''MRI'' scan can exclude non-gastrointestinal diseases. Once appropriate testing has been completed, empiric trials of other drugs (for example, smooth muscle relaxants, psychotropic drugs, and promotility drugs) can be done. (An empiric trial of a drug is a trial that is not based on an understanding of the exact cause of the symptoms)''If all of the appropriate testing reveals no disease that could be causing the symptoms and the dyspeptic symptoms have not responded to empiric treatments, other, more specialized tests should be considered. These tests include hydrogen breath testing to diagnose bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine, gastric emptying studies, ''EGG'', small intestinal transit studies, antro-duodenal motility and barostatic studies, and possibly ''capsule endoscopy''. These specialized studies probably should be done at centers that have experience and expertise in diagnosing and treating functional diseases.' Vomiting: upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to diagnose inflammatory or obstructing diseases; gastric emptying studies and/or electrogastrography to diagnose impaired emptying of the stomach. Abdominal distention with or without increased flatulence: upper gastrointestinal and small intestinal x-rays to diagnose obstructing diseases; hydrogen breath testing to diagnose bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine."
What research is ongoing for treatments to cure indigestion (dyspepsia)?,"'The future of dyspepsia will depend on our increasing knowledge of the processes (mechanisms) that cause dyspepsia. Acquiring this knowledge, in turn, depends on research funding. Because of the difficulties in conducting research in dyspepsia, this knowledge will not come quickly. Until we have an understanding of the mechanisms of dyspepsia, newer treatments will be based on our developing a better understanding of the normal control of gastrointestinal function, which is proceeding more rapidly. Specifically, there is intense interest in intestinal neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that the nerves of the intestine use to communicate with each other. The interactions of these neurotransmitters are responsible for adjusting (modulating) the functions of the intestines, such as contraction of muscles and secretion of fluid and ''mucus''.''5-hydroxytriptamine (5-HT or serotonin) is a neurotransmitter that stimulates several different receptors on nerves in the intestine. Examples of experimental drugs for intestinal neurotransmission are ''sumatriptan'' (''Imitrex'') and ''buspirone'"" (Buspar). These drugs are believed to reduce the responsiveness (sensitivity) of the sensory nerves to what's happening in the intestine by attaching to a particular 5-HT receptor, the 5-HT1 receptor. The 5-HT1 receptor drugs, however, have received only minimal study so far and their role in the treatment of dyspepsia, if any, is unclear.""'Promotility drugs similar to cisapride, as previously discussed, are being pursued actively.''Another area of active research is relaxation of the muscles of the stomach for the treatment of dyspepsia. Normally when food enters the stomach, the stomach relaxes to accommodate the food and the secretions it stimulates. Many patients with dyspepsia have been found to have reduced relaxation of the stomach when food enters, and it is possible that this results in discomfort. Drugs that specifically relax the muscles of the stomach are being developed, but more clinical trials showing their benefit are needed.' "
What is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)?,"'Other diseases and conditions can aggravate indigestion and other functional diseases.' Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO): A potential cause of indigestion is bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or SIBO), although the frequency with which this condition causes indigestion has not been determined, and there is little research in the area. The relationship between overgrowth and indigestion needs to be pursued, however, since many of the symptoms of indigestion are also symptoms of bacterial overgrowth. Overgrowth can be diagnosed by hydrogen breath testing and is treated primarily with antibiotics. Anxiety and/or depression are probably the most commonly-recognized exacerbating factors for patients with functional diseases. The menstrual cycle: During their periods, women often note that their functional symptoms are worse. This corresponds to the time during which the female hormones, estrogen and progesterone, are at their highest levels. Furthermore, it has been observed that treating women who have indigestion with leuprolide (Lupron), an injectable drug that shuts off the body's production of estrogen and progesterone, is effective at reducing symptoms of indigestion in premenopausal women. These observations support a role for hormones in the intensification of fun"
What endoscopy tests help exclude other diseases?,"'The endoscopic tests include:' Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy or EGD) to examine the esophagus, stomach and duodenum Colonoscopy to examine the colon and terminal ileum Endoscopy also is available to examine the small intestine, but this type of endoscopy is complex, not widely available, and of unproven value in indigestion. To examen the small intestine, a capsule containing a tiny camera and transmitter that can be swallowed (capsule endoscopy). As the capsule travels through the intestines, it transmits pictures of the inside of the intestines to an external recorder for later review. The capsule is not widely available and its value, particularly in indigestion, has not yet been proven. Newer endoscopes, similar to those used for EGD and colonoscopy are available that allow the entire small intestine to be examined. Unlike the capsule, however, the endoscope has channels in it that allow instruments to be passed into the intestine to collect samples of tissue (biopsies) and to treat abnormal findings such as polyps. X-rays are easier to perform and less costly than endoscopies. The skills necessary to perform gastrointestinal X-rays, however, are becoming rare among radiologists because they are doing them less often. Therefore, the quality of the X-rays often is not as high as it used to be, and, as a result, CT scans of the small intestine are replacing small intestinal X-rays. As noted previously, endoscopies have an advantage over X-rays since at the time of endoscopies, biopsies can be taken to diagnose or exclude histological diseases, something that X-rays cannot do."
"What is indigestion (dyspepsia, upset stomach)?","'Dyspepsia (indigestion) is best described as a functional disease. (Sometimes, it is called functional dyspepsia.) The concept of functional disease is particularly useful when discussing diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. The concept applies to the muscular organs of the gastrointestinal tract, the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, gallbladder, and colon that are controlled by nerves. What is meant by the term, functional, is that either the muscles of the organs or the nerves that control the organs are not working normally, and, as a result, the organs do not function normally, and the dysfunction causes the symptoms. The nerves that control the organs include not only the nerves that lie within the muscles of the organs but also the nerves of the spinal cord and brain.''Some gastrointestinal diseases can be seen and diagnosed with the naked eye, such as ulcers of the stomach and can be seen at surgery, on ''X-rays'', and by ''endoscopy''. Other diseases cannot be seen with the naked eye but can be seen and diagnosed under the microscope. For example, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach) can be diagnosed by microscopic examination of biopsies of the stomach. In contrast, gastrointestinal functional diseases cannot be seen with the naked eye or the microscope. Accordingly, and by default, functional gastrointestinal diseases are those that involve abnormal function of gastrointestinal organs in which the abnormalities cannot be seen in the organs with either the naked eye or the microscope.''In some instances, the abnormal function can be demonstrated by tests (for example, gastric emptying studies or antro-duodenal motility studies). However, the tests often are complex, are not widely available, and do not reliably detect the functional abnormalities.''Occasionally, diseases that are thought to be functional are ultimately found to be associated with abnormalities that can be seen by the naked eye or under the microscope. Then, the disease moves out of the functional category. An example of this would be '' ''Helicobacter pylori'' (''H. pylori'')'' infection of the stomach. Some patients with mild upper gastrointestinal symptoms who were thought to have abnormal function of the stomach or intestines have been found to have stomachs infected with ''H. pylori''. This infection can be diagnosed under the microscope by identifying the bacterium in biopsies from the stomach. When patients are treated with antibiotics, the ''H. pylori'' and symptoms disappear. Thus, recognition of infections with ''Helicobacter pylori'"" has removed some patients' symptoms from the functional disease category.""""The distinction between functional disease and non-functional disease may, in fact, be blurry. Thus, even functional diseases probably have associated biochemical or molecular abnormalities that ultimately will be able to be measured. For example, functional diseases of the stomach and intestines may be shown ultimately to be associated with reduced or increased levels of normal chemicals within the gastrointestinal organs, the spinal cord, or the brain. Should a disease that is demonstrated to be due to a reduced or increased chemical still be considered a functional disease? In this theoretical situation, we can't see the abnormality with the naked eye or the microscope, but we can measure it. If we can measure an associated or causative abnormality, should the disease no longer be considered functional, even though the disease (symptoms) are being caused by abnormal function? The answer is unclear.""'Despite the shortcomings of the term, functional, the concept of a functional abnormality is useful for approaching many of the symptoms originating from the muscular organs of the gastrointestinal tract. To repeat, this concept applies to those symptoms for which there are no associated abnormalities that can be seen with the naked eye or the microscope.''While dyspepsia is a major functional disease(s), it is important to mention several other functional diseases. A second major functional disease is the ''irritable bowel syndrome'', or ''IBS''. The ''symptoms of IBS'' are thought to originate primarily from the small intestine and/or colon. The symptoms of ''IBS'' include abdominal ''pain'' that is accompanied by alterations in bowel movements (defecation), primarily ''constipation'' or ''diarrhea''. In fact, indigestion and ''IBS'' may be overlapping diseases since up to half of patients with ''IBS'' also have symptoms of indigestion. A third distinct functional disorder is non-cardiac ''chest pain''. This ''pain'' may mimic heart pain (''angina''), but it is unassociated with ''heart disease''. In fact, non-cardiac chest pain is thought to often result from a functional abnormality of the esophagus.''Functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract often are categorized by the organ of involvement. Thus, there are functional disorders of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, and gallbladder. The amount of research that has been done with functional disorders is greatest in the esophagus and stomach (for example, non-cardiac chest pain, indigestion), perhaps because these organs are easiest to reach and study. Research into functional disorders affecting the small intestine and colon (IBS) is more difficult to conduct, and there is less agreement among the research studies. This probably is a reflection of the complexity of the activities of the small intestine and colon and the difficulty in studying these activities. Functional diseases of the gallbladder (referred to as biliary ''dyskinesia''), like those of the small intestine and colon, are more difficult to study, and at present they are less well-defined. Each of the functional diseases is associated with its own set of characteristic symptoms.' "
How common is indigestion?,"'Indigestion is one of the most common ailments of the bowel (intestines), affecting an estimated 20% of persons in the United States. Perhaps only 10% of those affected actually seek medical attention for their indigestion. Indigestion is not a particularly good term for the ailment since it implies that there is ""dyspepsia"" or abnormal ''digestion'' of food, and this most probably is not the case. In fact, another common name for dyspepsia is indigestion, which, for the same reason, is no better than the term dyspepsia! Doctors frequently refer to the condition as non-ulcer dyspepsia to distinguish it from the more common acid or ulcer-related symptoms.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of indigestion or upset stomach?,"'We usually think of symptoms of indigestion as originating from the upper gastrointestinal tract, primarily the stomach and first part of the small intestine. These symptoms include:''The symptoms most often are provoked by eating, which is a time when many different gastrointestinal functions are called upon to work in concert. This tendency to occur after meals is what gave rise to the erroneous notion that indigestion might be caused by an abnormality in the digestion of food.' upper abdominal pain or discomfort (above or around the navel), belching, nausea (with or without vomiting), abdominal bloating (the sensation of abdominal fullness without visible distention), early satiety (the sensation of fullness after a very small amount of food), abdominal distention (visible swelling as opposed to bloating), and lower chest pain."
Abdominal discomfort and excessive air in the stomach,"'Everyone knows that when they have mild abdominal discomfort, belching often relieves the problem. This is because excessive air in the stomach often is the cause of mild abdominal discomfort; as a result, people force belches whenever mild abdominal discomfort is felt, whatever the cause. Unfortunately, if there is no excessive ''gas'' to be expelled, forced belches do nothing more than draw air into the esophagus. Usually this air is expelled during the same belch (referred to as a supradiaphragmatic belch), but the air also may enter the stomach, and itself result in excess gas that must be expelled with additional belching.''If the problem causing the discomfort is not excessive air in the stomach, then belching does not provide relief. As mentioned previously, it even may make the situation worse by increasing air in the stomach. When belching does not ease the discomfort, the belching should be taken as a sign that something may be wrong within the abdomen, and the cause of the discomfort should be sought. Belching by itself, however, does not help the physician determine what may be wrong because belching can occur in virtually any abdominal disease or condition that causes discomfort.' "
Is burping (belching) a symptom of indigestion?,"'It is appropriate to discuss belching in detail since it is a commonly misunderstood symptom associated with indigestion.''Excessive air in the stomach is not the only cause of belching.' The ability to belch is almost universal. Belching, also known as burping or eructating, is the act of expelling gas from the stomach out through the mouth. The usual cause of belching is a distended (inflated) stomach that is caused by swallowed air or gas. The distention of the stomach causes abdominal discomfort, and the belching expels the air and relieves the discomfort. The common reasons for swallowing large amounts of air (aerophagia) or gas aregulping food or drink too rapidly,anxiety, andcarbonated beverages. gulping food or drink too rapidly, anxiety, and carbonated beverages. People often are unaware that they are swallowing air. ""Burping"" infants during bottle or breastfeeding is important in order to expel air in the stomach that has been swallowed with the formula or milk. For some people, belching becomes a habit and does not reflect the amount of air in their stomachs. For others, belching is a response to any type of abdominal discomfort and not just to discomfort due to increased gas."
How long does indigestion (dyspepsia) last?,"'Indigestion is a chronic disease that usually lasts years, if not a lifetime. It does, however, display periodicity, which means that the symptoms may be more frequent or severe for days, weeks, or months and then less frequent or severe for days, weeks, or months. The reasons for these fluctuations are unknown. Because of the fluctuations, it is important to judge the effects of treatment over many weeks or months to be certain that any improvement is due to treatment and not simply to a natural fluctuation in the frequency or severity of the disease.' "
What other non-functional GI diseases mimic indigestion? How are they diagnosed?,"'A detailed history from the patient and a physical examination frequently will suggest the cause of dyspepsia. Routine screening blood tests often are performed looking for clues to unsuspected diseases. Examinations of ''stool'' are a part of the evaluation since they may reveal infection, signs of inflammation, or blood and direct further diagnostic testing. Sensitive ''stool'' testing (antigen/antibody) for ''Giardia lamblia'' would be reasonable because this parasitic infection is common and can be acute or chronic. Some physicians do blood testing for ''celiac disease'' (sprue), but the value of doing this is unclear. (Moreover, if an ''EGD'' is planned, biopsies of the duodenum usually will make the diagnosis of ''celiac disease''.) If bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine is being considered, breath hydrogen testing can be considered.''There are many tests to exclude non-functional gastrointestinal diseases. The primary issue, however, is to decide which tests are reasonable to perform. Since each case is individual, different tests may be reasonable for different patients. Nevertheless, certain basic tests are often performed to exclude non-functional gastrointestinal disease. These tests identify anatomic (structural) and histological (microscopic) diseases of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines.''Both X-rays and endoscopies can identify anatomic diseases. Only endoscopies, however, can diagnose histological diseases because biopsies (samples of tissue) can be taken during the procedure. The X-ray tests include:' The esophagram and video-fluoroscopic swallowing study for examining the esophagus The upper gastrointestinal series for examining the stomach and duodenum The small bowel series for examining the small intestine The barium enema for examining the colon and terminal ileum. The computerized tomography (CT) scan for examining the small intestine"
What causes of indigestion are non-digestive?,"""It's not surprising that many gastrointestinal (GI) diseases have been associated with indigestion. However, many non-GI diseases also have been associated with indigestion. Examples of non-GI causes of indigestion include""'It is not clear, however, how these non-GI diseases might cause indigestion.''Another important cause of indigestion is drugs. Many drugs are frequently associated with indigestion, for example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'' such as ''ibuprofen''), antibiotics, and ''estrogens''). In fact, most drugs are reported to cause indigestion in at least some people with functional symptoms.'   diabetes, thyroid disease, hyperparathyroidism (overactive parathyroid glands), and severe kidney disease."
Antidepressants for indigestion,"'Patients with functional disorders, including indigestion, are frequently found to be suffering from ''depression'' and/or ''anxiety''. It is unclear, however, if the ''depression'' and ''anxiety'' are the cause or the result of the functional disorders or are unrelated to these disorders. (''Depression'' and ''anxiety'' are common and, therefore, their occurrence together with functional disorders may be coincidental.) Several ''clinical trials'' have shown that ''antidepressants'' are effective in IBS in relieving abdominal pain. Antidepressants also have been shown to be effective in unexplained (non-cardiac) chest pain, a condition thought to represent a dysfunction of the esophagus. Antidepressants have not been studied adequately in other types of functional disorders, including indigestion. It probably is reasonable to treat patients with indigestion with psychotropic drugs if they have moderate or severe ''depression'' or anxiety.''The antidepressants work in functional disorders at relatively low doses that have little or no effect on depression. It is believed, therefore, that these drugs work not by combating depression, but in different ways (through different mechanisms). For example, these drugs have been shown to adjust (modulate) the activity of the nerves and to have analgesic (pain-relieving) effects as well.''Commonly used psychotropic drugs include the ''tricyclic antidepressants'', ''desipramine'' (Norpramine) and ''trimipramine'' (''Surmontil''). Although studies are encouraging, it is not yet clear whether the newer class of antidepressants, the serotonin-reuptake inhibitors such as ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), and ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), are effective in functional disorders, including indigestion.' "
Diet and indigestion,"'Dietary factors have not been well-studied in the treatment of indigestion. Nevertheless, people often associate their symptoms with specific foods (such as salads and ''fats''). Although specific foods might worsen the symptoms of indigestion, they usually are not the cause of indigestion. (Intolerance to specific foods, for example, ''lactose intolerance'' [milk] and ''allergies'' to wheat, eggs, ''soy'', and milk protein are not considered functional diseases like indigestion). The common placebo response in functional disorders such as indigestion also may explain the improvement of symptoms in some people with the elimination of specific foods.''Dietary ''fiber'' often is recommended for patients with IBS, but fiber has not been studied in the treatment of indigestion. Nevertheless, it probably is reasonable to treat patients with indigestion with fiber if they also have ''constipation''.''Intolerance to lactose (the ''sugar'' in milk) often is blamed for indigestion. Since indigestion and lactose intolerance both are common, the two conditions may coexist. In this situation, restricting lactose will improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance, but will not affect the symptoms of indigestion. Lactose intolerance is easily determined by a milk challenge testing the effects of lactose (hydrogen breath testing) or trying a strict lactose elimination ''diet''. If lactose is determined to be responsible for some or all of the symptoms, elimination of lactose-containing foods is appropriate. Unfortunately, many patients stop drinking milk or eating milk-containing foods without good evidence that it improves their symptoms. This often is detrimental to their intake of calcium which may contribute to ''osteoporosis''.'""One of the food substances most commonly associated with the symptoms of indigestion is fat. The scientific evidence that fat causes indigestion is weak. Most of the support is anecdotal (not based on carefully done, scientific studies). Nevertheless, fat is one of the most potent influences on gastrointestinal function. (It tends to slow down the gastrointestinal muscles while it causes the muscles of the gallbladder to contract.) Therefore, it is possible that fat may worsen indigestion even though it doesn't cause it. Moreover, reducing the ingestion of fat might relieve symptoms. A strict low fat ""'diet'' can be accomplished fairly easily and is worth trying. Additionally, there are other health-related reasons for reducing dietary fat.''Other dietary factors, fructose, and other ''sugar''-related foods (fermentable, oligo- di- and ''mono''-saccharides and polyols or ''FODMAPs''), have been suggested as a cause of indigestion since many people do not fully digest and absorb them before they reach the distal intestine. Fructose intolerance and perhaps also ''FODMAP'' intolerance can be diagnosed with a ''hydrogen breath test'' using fructose and treated by elimination of fructose and/or FODMAP containing foods from the diet. Unfortunately, fructose and FODMAPs are widespread among fruits and vegetables, and fructose is found in high concentrations in many food products sweetened with ''corn'' syrup. Thus, an elimination diet can be difficult to maintain.' "
Pro-motility medication for indigestion,"'One of the leading theories for the cause of indigestion is abnormalities in the way gastrointestinal muscles function. The function of muscles may be abnormally increased, abnormally decreased, or it may by uncoordinated. There are medications, called smooth muscle relaxants that can reduce the activity of the muscles and other drugs that can increase the activity of the muscles, called promotility drugs.''Many of the symptoms of indigestion can be explained on the basis of reduced activity of the gastrointestinal muscles that results in slowed transport (transit) of food through the stomach and intestine. (It is clear, as discussed previously, that there are other causes of these symptoms in addition to slowed transit.) Such symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating. When transit is severely affected, abdominal distention (swelling) also may occur and can result in abdominal pain. (Early satiety is unlikely to be a function of slowed transit because it occurs too early for slowed transit to have consequences.) Theoretically, drugs that speed up the transit of food should, in at least some patients, relieve symptoms of indigestion that are due to slow transit.''The number of promotility drugs that are available for use clinically is limited. Studies of their effectiveness in indigestion are even more limited. The most studied drug is cisapride (Propulsid), a promotility drug that was withdrawn from the market because of serious cardiac side effects. (Newer drugs that have similar effects but lack the toxicity are being developed.) The few studies with cisapride for indigestion were inconsistent in their results. Some studies demonstrated benefits whereas others showed no benefit. Cisapride was effective in patients with severe emptying problems of the stomach (''gastroparesis'') or severely slowed transit of food through the small intestine (chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction). These two diseases may or may not be related to indigestion.''Another promotility drug that is available is ''erythromycin'', an antibiotic that stimulates gastrointestinal smooth muscle as one of its side effects. Erythromycin is used to stimulate smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract at doses that are lower than those used for treating infections. There are no studies of erythromycin in indigestion, but erythromycin is effective in gastroparesis and probably also in chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.''Metoclopramide'' (''Reglan'') is another promotility drug that is available. It has not been studied, however, in indigestion. Moreover, it is associated with some troubling side effects. Therefore, it may not be a good drug to undergo further testing in indigestion.''Domperidone'' (Motilium) is a promotility drug that is available in the U.S., but requires a special permit from the US Food and Drug administration. As a result, it is not very commonly prescribed. It is an effective drug with minimal side effects.' "
How do you know if you have indigestion (diagnosis)?,"'Indigestion is diagnosed primarily based on typical symptoms and the exclusion of non-functional gastrointestinal diseases (including acid-related diseases), non-gastrointestinal diseases, and psychiatric illness. There are tests for identifying abnormal gastrointestinal function directly, but they are limited in their ability to do so.' "
What natural or home remedies are used to treat dyspepsia (indigestion)?,"'Studies of natural and home remedies for indigestion are few. Most recommendations for natural and home remedies have little evidence to support their use. Several potential remedies, however, deserve mention including:' Acid-suppressing remedies: The most common cause of dyspepsia is probably gastrointestinal reflux disease (acid reflux or GERD). That may be why remedies such as baking soda, which neutralizes stomach acid, have been recommended. Even if baking soda works, it is more effective (and probably safer) to use antacids in liquid or pill form for this purpose. Ginger: Ginger has been demonstrated to relieve nausea. One small study showed it to be ineffective in relieving dyspepsia, but ginger is harmless and worth a try if nausea is a component of the dyspepsia. Peppermint: Peppermint has been demonstrated to have effects on the function of the gastrointestinal tract; it is among the most potent inhibitors of intestinal muscles. It is effective in another functional disease, irritable bowel syndrome, but there is minimal evidence that it is effective in dyspepsia. Nevertheless, like ginger, it is harmless and worth a try. Meals: Eating smaller, more frequent meals. Lifestyle changes: Stay away from specific foods and drinks, smoking, and alcohol if they provoke symptoms."
What treatments relieve and cure indigestion (dyspepsia)?,"'The treatment of indigestion is a difficult and unsatisfying topic because so few drugs have been studied and have been shown to be effective. Moreover, the drugs that have been shown to be effective have not been shown to be very effective. This difficult situation exists for many reasons including:''The lack of understanding of the physiologic processes (mechanisms) that cause indigestion has meant that treatment usually cannot be directed at the mechanisms. Instead, treatment usually is directed at the symptoms. For example, nausea is treated with medications that suppress nausea but do not affect the cause of the nausea. On the other hand, the psychotropic drugs (antidepressants) and psychological treatments (such as ''cognitive behavioral therapy'') treat hypothetical causes of indigestion (for example, abnormal function of sensory nerves and the psyche) rather than causes or even the symptoms. Treatment for indigestion often is similar to that for ''irritable bowel'' syndrome (IBS) even though the causes of IBS and indigestion are likely to be different.'""It is important to educate patients with indigestion about their illness, particularly by reassuring them that the illness is not a serious threat to their physical health (though it may be to their emotional health). Patients need to understand the potential causes for the symptoms. Most importantly, they need to understand the medical approach to the problem and the reasons for each test or treatment. Education prepares patients for a potentially prolonged course of diagnosis and trials of treatment. Education also may prevent patients from falling prey to the charlatans who offer unproven and possibly dangerous treatments for indigestion. Many symptoms are tolerable if patients' anxieties about the seriousness of their symptoms can be relieved. It also helps patients deal with symptoms when they feel that everything that should be done to diagnose and treat, in fact, is being done. The truth is that psychologically healthy people can tolerate a good deal of discomfort and continue to lead happy and productive lives."" Life-threatening illnesses (for example, cancer, heart disease, and high blood pressure) are the illnesses that capture the public's interest and, more importantly, research funding. Indigestion is not a life-threatening illness and has received little research funding. Because of the lack of research, an understanding of the physiologic processes (mechanisms) that are responsible for indigestion has been slow to develop. Effective drugs cannot be developed until there is an understanding of these mechanisms. Research in indigestion is difficult. Indigestion is defined by subjective symptoms (such as pain) rather than objective signs (for example, the presence of an ulcer). Subjective symptoms are more unreliable than objective signs in identifying homogenous groups of patients. As a result, groups of patients with indigestion who are undergoing treatment are likely to contain some patients who do not have indigestion, which may dilute (negatively affect) the results of the treatment. Moreover, the results of treatment must be evaluated on the basis of subjective responses (such as improvement of pain). In addition to being more unreliable, subjective responses are more difficult to measure than objective responses (for example, healing of an ulcer). Different subtypes of indigestion (for example, abdominal pain and abdominal bloating) are likely to be caused by different physiologic processes (mechanisms). It also is possible, however, that the same subtype of indigestion may be caused by different mechanisms in different people. What's more, any drug is likely to affect only one mechanism. Therefore, it is unlikely that any one medication can be effective in all-even most-patients with indigestion, even patients with similar symptoms. This inconsistent effectiveness makes the testing of drugs particularly difficult. Indeed, it can easily result in drug trials that demonstrate no efficacy (usefulness) when, in fact, the drug is helping a subgroup of patients. Subjective symptoms are particularly prone to responding to placebos (inactive drugs). In fact, in most studies, 20% to 40% of patients with indigestion will improve if they receive placebo drugs. Now, all clinical trials of drugs for indigestion require a placebo-treated group for comparison with the drug-treated group. The large placebo response means that these clinical trials must utilize large numbers of patients to detect meaningful (significant) differences in improvement between the placebo and drug groups. Therefore, these trials are expensive to conduct."
Smooth muscle relaxants for indigestion,"'The most widely studied drugs for the treatment of abdominal pain in functional disorders are a group of drugs called smooth-muscle relaxants.''The gastrointestinal tract is primarily composed of a type of muscle called smooth muscle. (By contrast, skeletal muscles such as the biceps are composed of a type of muscle called striated muscle.) Smooth muscle relaxant drugs reduce the strength of contraction of the smooth muscles but do not affect the contraction of other types of muscles. They are used in functional disorders, particularly IBS, with the assumption (not proven) that strong or prolonged contractions of smooth muscles in the intestine-spasms-are the cause of the pain in functional disorders. There are even smooth muscle relaxants that are placed under the tongue, as is ''nitroglycerin'' for angina, so that they may be absorbed rapidly.''There are not enough studies of smooth muscle relaxants in indigestion to conclude that they are effective at reducing pain. Since their side effects are few, these drugs probably are worth trying. As with all drugs that are given to control symptoms, patients should carefully evaluate whether or not the smooth muscle relaxant they are using is effective at controlling the symptoms. If it is not clearly effective, the option of discontinuing the relaxant should be discussed with a physician.''Commonly used smooth muscle relaxants are ''hyoscyamine'' (''Levsin'', ''Anaspaz'', ''Cystospaz'', ''Donnamar'') and methscopolamine (''Pamine'', ''Pamine Forte''). Other drugs combine smooth muscle relaxants with a sedative ''chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride and clidinium bromide'' (''Donnatal'', ''Librax''), but there is no evidence that the addition of ''sedatives'' adds to the effectiveness of the treatment.' "
Psychological treatments for indigestion,"'Psychological treatments include cognitive-behavioral therapy, hypnosis, psychodynamic or interpersonal ''psychotherapy'', and relaxation/''stress management''. Few studies of psychological treatments have been conducted in indigestion, although more studies have been done in IBS. Thus, there is little scientific evidence that they are effective in indigestion, although there is some evidence that they are effective in IBS.''Hypnosis has been proposed as an effective treatment for IBS. It is unclear exactly how effective hypnosis is, or how it works.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat indigestion (dyspepsia)?,"'Since indigestion is very common, almost all doctors see and treat patients with indigestion, especially family practitioners, internists and even pediatricians. If these generalists are unable to provide adequate treatment, the patient usually is referred to a ''gastroenterologist'', an internist or pediatrician with specialty training in gastrointestinal diseases.' "
What are the complications of indigestion (dyspepsia)?,"'The complications of functional diseases of the gastrointestinal tract are relatively limited. Since symptoms are most often provoked by eating, patients who alter their diets and reduce their intake of calories may ''lose weight''. However, loss of weight is unusual in functional diseases. In fact, loss of weight should suggest the presence of non-functional diseases. Symptoms that awaken patients from ''sleep'' also are more likely to be due to non-functional than functional disease.'""Most commonly, functional diseases interfere with patients' comfort and daily activities. Individuals who develop nausea or pain after eating may skip breakfast or lunch because of the symptoms they experience. Patients also commonly associate symptoms with specific foods (for example, milk, fat, vegetables). Whether or not the associations are real, these patients will restrict their diets accordingly. Milk is the most common food that is eliminated, often unnecessarily, and this can lead to inadequate intake of calcium and ""'osteoporosis''. The interference with daily activities also can lead to problems with interpersonal relationships, especially with spouses. Most patients with functional disease live with their symptoms and infrequently visit physicians for diagnosis and treatment.'  "
What can a person expect during the diagnosis and treatment of indigestion (prognosis)?,"""The initial approach to dyspepsia, whether it be treatment or testing, depends on the patient's age, symptoms and the duration of the symptoms. If the patient is younger than 50 years of age and serious disease, particularly ""'cancer'', is not likely, testing is less important. If the symptoms are typical for dyspepsia and have been present for many years without change, then there is less need for testing, or at least extensive testing, to exclude other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases.''On the other hand, if the symptoms are of recent onset (weeks or months), progressively worsening, severe, or associated with ""warning"" signs, then early, more extensive testing is appropriate. Warning signs include loss of weight, nighttime awakening, ''blood in the stool'' or the material that is vomited (vomitus), and signs of inflammation, such as ''fever'' or abdominal tenderness. Testing also is appropriate if, in addition to symptoms of dyspepsia, there are other prominent symptoms that are not commonly associated with dyspepsia.''If there are symptoms that suggest conditions other than dyspepsia, tests that are specific for these diseases should be done first. The reason is that if these other tests disclose other diseases, it may not be necessary to do additional testing. Examples of such symptoms and possible testing include:''For a patient with typical symptoms of dyspepsia who requires testing to exclude other diseases, a standard screening panel of blood tests would reasonably be included. These tests might reveal clues to non-gastrointestinal diseases. Sensitive stool testing (antigen/antibody) for ''Giardia'' lamblia would be reasonable because this parasitic infection is common and can be acute or chronic. Some physicians do blood testing for ''celiac disease'' (sprue), but the value of doing this is unclear. Moreover, if an EGD is planned, biopsies of the duodenum usually will make the diagnosis of ''celiac disease'"". A plain X-ray of the abdomen might be done during an episode of abdominal pain (to look for intestinal blockage or obstruction). Testing for lactose intolerance or a trial of a strict lactose-free diet should be considered. The physician's clinical judgment should determine the extent to which initial testing is appropriate.""'Once testing has been done to an extent that is appropriate for the clinical situation, it is reasonable to first try a therapeutic trial of stomach acid suppression to see if symptoms improve. Such a trial probably should involve a PPI (proton pump inhibitor) for 8 to 12 weeks. If there is no clear response of symptoms, the options then are to discontinue the PPI or confirm its effectiveness in suppressing acid with 24 hour acid testing. If there is a clear and substantial decrease in symptoms with the PPI, then decisions need to be made about continuing acid suppression and which drugs to use.''Another therapeutic approach is to test for ''Helicobacter pylori'' infection of the stomach (with blood, breath or stool tests) and to treat patients with infection to eradicate the infection. It may be necessary to retest patients after treatment to prove that treatment has effectively eradicated the infection, particularly if dyspeptic symptoms persist after treatment.''If treatment with a PPI has satisfactorily suppressed acid according to acid testing (or acid suppression has not been measured) and yet the symptoms have not improved, it is reasonable to conduct further testing as described above. Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy, or EGD, (and, possibly, ''colonoscopy'') would be the next consideration, probably with multiple biopsies of the stomach and duodenum (and colon if colonoscopy is done). Finally, small intestinal x-rays and an ''ultrasound'' examination of the gallbladder might be done. An abdominal ultrasound examination, ''CT scan'', or ''MRI'' scan can exclude non-gastrointestinal diseases. Once appropriate testing has been completed, empiric trials of other drugs (for example, smooth muscle relaxants, psychotropic drugs, and promotility drugs) can be done. (An empiric trial of a drug is a trial that is not based on an understanding of the exact cause of the symptoms)''If all of the appropriate testing reveals no disease that could be causing the symptoms and the dyspeptic symptoms have not responded to empiric treatments, other, more specialized tests should be considered. These tests include hydrogen breath testing to diagnose bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine, gastric emptying studies, ''EGG'', small intestinal transit studies, antro-duodenal motility and barostatic studies, and possibly ''capsule endoscopy''. These specialized studies probably should be done at centers that have experience and expertise in diagnosing and treating functional diseases.' Vomiting: upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to diagnose inflammatory or obstructing diseases; gastric emptying studies and/or electrogastrography to diagnose impaired emptying of the stomach. Abdominal distention with or without increased flatulence: upper gastrointestinal and small intestinal x-rays to diagnose obstructing diseases; hydrogen breath testing to diagnose bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine."
What research is ongoing for treatments to cure indigestion (dyspepsia)?,"'The future of dyspepsia will depend on our increasing knowledge of the processes (mechanisms) that cause dyspepsia. Acquiring this knowledge, in turn, depends on research funding. Because of the difficulties in conducting research in dyspepsia, this knowledge will not come quickly. Until we have an understanding of the mechanisms of dyspepsia, newer treatments will be based on our developing a better understanding of the normal control of gastrointestinal function, which is proceeding more rapidly. Specifically, there is intense interest in intestinal neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that the nerves of the intestine use to communicate with each other. The interactions of these neurotransmitters are responsible for adjusting (modulating) the functions of the intestines, such as contraction of muscles and secretion of fluid and ''mucus''.''5-hydroxytriptamine (5-HT or serotonin) is a neurotransmitter that stimulates several different receptors on nerves in the intestine. Examples of experimental drugs for intestinal neurotransmission are ''sumatriptan'' (''Imitrex'') and ''buspirone'"" (Buspar). These drugs are believed to reduce the responsiveness (sensitivity) of the sensory nerves to what's happening in the intestine by attaching to a particular 5-HT receptor, the 5-HT1 receptor. The 5-HT1 receptor drugs, however, have received only minimal study so far and their role in the treatment of dyspepsia, if any, is unclear.""'Promotility drugs similar to cisapride, as previously discussed, are being pursued actively.''Another area of active research is relaxation of the muscles of the stomach for the treatment of dyspepsia. Normally when food enters the stomach, the stomach relaxes to accommodate the food and the secretions it stimulates. Many patients with dyspepsia have been found to have reduced relaxation of the stomach when food enters, and it is possible that this results in discomfort. Drugs that specifically relax the muscles of the stomach are being developed, but more clinical trials showing their benefit are needed.' "
What is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)?,"'Other diseases and conditions can aggravate indigestion and other functional diseases.' Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO): A potential cause of indigestion is bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or SIBO), although the frequency with which this condition causes indigestion has not been determined, and there is little research in the area. The relationship between overgrowth and indigestion needs to be pursued, however, since many of the symptoms of indigestion are also symptoms of bacterial overgrowth. Overgrowth can be diagnosed by hydrogen breath testing and is treated primarily with antibiotics. Anxiety and/or depression are probably the most commonly-recognized exacerbating factors for patients with functional diseases. The menstrual cycle: During their periods, women often note that their functional symptoms are worse. This corresponds to the time during which the female hormones, estrogen and progesterone, are at their highest levels. Furthermore, it has been observed that treating women who have indigestion with leuprolide (Lupron), an injectable drug that shuts off the body's production of estrogen and progesterone, is effective at reducing symptoms of indigestion in premenopausal women. These observations support a role for hormones in the intensification of fun"
What endoscopy tests help exclude other diseases?,"'The endoscopic tests include:' Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy or EGD) to examine the esophagus, stomach and duodenum Colonoscopy to examine the colon and terminal ileum Endoscopy also is available to examine the small intestine, but this type of endoscopy is complex, not widely available, and of unproven value in indigestion. To examen the small intestine, a capsule containing a tiny camera and transmitter that can be swallowed (capsule endoscopy). As the capsule travels through the intestines, it transmits pictures of the inside of the intestines to an external recorder for later review. The capsule is not widely available and its value, particularly in indigestion, has not yet been proven. Newer endoscopes, similar to those used for EGD and colonoscopy are available that allow the entire small intestine to be examined. Unlike the capsule, however, the endoscope has channels in it that allow instruments to be passed into the intestine to collect samples of tissue (biopsies) and to treat abnormal findings such as polyps. X-rays are easier to perform and less costly than endoscopies. The skills necessary to perform gastrointestinal X-rays, however, are becoming rare among radiologists because they are doing them less often. Therefore, the quality of the X-rays often is not as high as it used to be, and, as a result, CT scans of the small intestine are replacing small intestinal X-rays. As noted previously, endoscopies have an advantage over X-rays since at the time of endoscopies, biopsies can be taken to diagnose or exclude histological diseases, something that X-rays cannot do."
What is campomelic dysplasia?,"'Campomelic dysplasia is a severe disorder that affects the development of the skeleton and reproductive system. This condition is often life-threatening in the ''newborn'' period. The term ""campomelic"" comes from the Greek words for ""bent limb."" Affected individuals are typically born with bowing of the long bones in the legs, and they are occasionally born with bowing in the arms. Bowing can cause characteristic skin dimples to form over the curved bone, especially on the lower legs. People with campomelic dysplasia also usually have short legs, dislocated hips, underdeveloped shoulder blades, 11 pairs of ribs instead of 12, bone abnormalities in the neck, and ''feet'' that are abnormally rotated (clubfeet). When affected individuals have features of this disorder but do not have bowed limbs, they are said to have acampomelic campomelic dysplasia.''Many people with campomelic dysplasia have external genitalia that do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous genitalia). Approximately 75 percent of affected individuals with a typical male chromosome pattern (46,XY) have ambiguous genitalia or normal female genitalia. Internal reproductive organs may not correspond with the external genitalia; they can be male (testes), female (ovaries), or a combination of the two.''Affected individuals have distinctive facial features, including a small chin, prominent eyes, and a flat face. They also have a large head compared to their body size. A particular group of physical features, called Pierre-Robin sequence, is common in people with campomelic dysplasia. Pierre-Robin sequence includes an opening in the roof of the mouth (a ''cleft palate''), a tongue that is placed further back than normal (glossoptosis), and a small lower jaw (micrognathia). People with campomelic dysplasia are often born with weakened cartilage that forms the upper respiratory tract. This abnormality, called laryngotracheomalacia, partially blocks the ''airway'' and causes difficulty ''breathing''. Laryngotracheomalacia contributes to the poor survival of infants with campomelic dysplasia.''Only a few people with campomelic dysplasia survive past infancy. As these individuals age, they may develop an abnormal curvature of the spine (''scoliosis'') and other spine abnormalities that compress the spinal cord. People with campomelic dysplasia may also have ''short stature'' and ''hearing loss''.' "
How common is campomelic dysplasia?,"'The prevalence of campomelic dysplasia is uncertain; estimates range from 1 in 40,000 to 200,000 births.' "
What genes are related to campomelic dysplasia?,"'Mutations in or near the SOX9 gene cause campomelic dysplasia. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of many different tissues and organs during embryonic development. The SOX9 protein regulates the activity of other genes, especially those that are important for development of the skeleton and reproductive organs.''Most cases of campomelic dysplasia are caused by mutations within the SOX9 gene. These mutations prevent the production of the SOX9 protein or result in a protein with impaired function. About 5 percent of cases are caused by chromosome abnormalities that occur around the SOX9 gene. These chromosome abnormalities disrupt regions of DNA that normally regulate the activity of the SOX9 gene. All of these genetic changes prevent the SOX9 protein from properly controlling the genes essential for normal development of the skeleton, reproductive system, and other parts of the body. Abnormal development of these structures causes the signs and symptoms of campomelic dysplasia.' "
How do people inherit campomelic dysplasia?,"'Campomelic dysplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from new mutations in or near the SOX9 gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Rarely, affected individuals inherit a chromosome abnormality from a parent who may or may not show mild signs and symptoms of campomelic dysplasia.' "
What other names do people use for campomelic dysplasia?, Campomelic dwarfism Campomelic syndrome Camptomelic dysplasia
Facts you should know about cervical dysplasia," Cervical dysplasia is precancerous change in the lining cells of the cervix of the uterus. Cervical dysplasia is caused by infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV), but other factors also play a role. HPV infection is common in the general population. It is unclear why some women develop dysplasia and cervical cancer related to HPV infection while others do not. Typically, cervical dysplasia does not produce any signs or symptoms. Cervical dysplasia is diagnosed by tissue biopsy from the cervix, vagina, or vulva. Treatment, when necessary, involves ablation (destruction) or resection (removal) of the abnormal area. A vaccine is available against nine common HPV types associated with the development of dysplasia and cervical cancer"
What is cervical dysplasia?,"'Cervical dysplasia refers to the presence of precancerous changes of the cells that make up the surface of the cervix, the opening to the womb (uterus). The term dysplasia refers to the abnormal appearance of the cells when viewed under the microscope. The degree and extent of abnormality seen on a tissue sample biopsy was formerly referred to as mild, moderate, or severe dysplasia. In recent years, this nomenclature has been replaced by a newer system. These systems are based upon changes in the appearance of cells visualized when smears of individual cells (cytological changes) or tissue biopsies (histological changes) are reviewed under a microscope. Pap smears obtain samples of the surface cells to determine if they are normal or abnormal and do not provide a diagnosis, which can only be done by a tissue biopsy.''These classification systems will be further discussed below.'   Pap smears are described according to the degree of abnormality: ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance), LSIL (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) and HSIL (high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Cells from glandular rather than squamous epithelium may also be described. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)  is cervical dysplasia that is a pathological diagnosis based on a cervical biopsy or surgically removed cervix. This is indicated by CIN1 (mild), CIN2 (moderate), CIN III (severe). These are all precancerous conditions."
What causes cervical dysplasia?,"'Cervical dysplasia generally develops after infection of the cervix with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Although there are over 100 HPV types, a subgroup of ''HPVs'' have been found to infect the lining cells of the genital tract in women. HPV is a very common infection and is transmitted most often through sexual contact. Most infections occur in young women, do not produce symptoms, and resolve spontaneously without any long-term consequences. The average length of new HPV infections in young women is 8-13 months. However, it is possible to become re-infected with a different HPV type.''Some HPV infections persist over time rather than resolve, and the reason why the infection persists in these women is not fully understood. Factors that may influence persistence of the infection include:''Persistent HPV infection has been shown to play a causal role in the development of ''genital warts'' and precancerous changes (dysplasia) of the uterine cervix as well as cervical ''cancer''. Even though HPV infection appears to be necessary for the development of cervical dysplasia and ''cancer'', not all women who have HPV infection develop dysplasia or ''cancer of the cervix''. Additional, yet uncharacterized, factors must also be important in causing cervical dysplasia and ''cancer''. Since HPV infections are transmitted primarily by sexual intimacy, the risk of infection increases as the number of sexual partners increases.''Among the HPVs that infect the genital tract, certain types typically cause ''warts'' or mild dysplasia (""low-risk"" types; HPV-6, HPV-11), while other types (known as ""high-risk"" HPV types) are more strongly associated with severe dysplasia and cervical cancer (HPV-16, HPV-18). ''Cigarette smoking'' and suppression of the immune system (such as with concurrent ''HIV'' infection) have been shown to increase the risk for HPV-induced dysplasia and cancer of the cervix.''The HPV types that cause cervical cancer also have been linked with both anal and ''penile cancer'' in men as well as a subgroup of head and neck ''cancers'' in both women and men.' advancing age, duration of the infection, and being infected with a ""high-risk"" HPV type (see below)."
Are there signs and symptoms of cervical dysplasia?,"'Typically, cervical dysplasia does not produce any signs or symptoms. So regular  ''Pap smear'' screening is important for early diagnosis and treatment.' "
"How 
do medical professionals diagnose cervical dysplasia?","'Cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer generally develop over a period of years, so regular screening is essential to detect and treat early precancerous changes and prevent cervical cancer. Historically, the Papanicolaou test (''Pap test'' or Pap smear) was the screening method of choice. To perform the Pap smear, the health care practitioner removes a swab or brush sample of cells from the outside of the cervix during a pelvic examination using a speculum in the vagina for visualization. The cells are smeared onto a glass slide, stained, and observed under the microscope for any evidence of abnormal cells.''Newer, liquid-based systems to screen samples of cervical cells became much more common and are effective screening tools for detection of abnormal cells. The samples for this test are obtained the same way as for the conventional Pap smear, but the sample is placed in a vial of liquid that is later used to prepare a microscope slide for examination as with the Pap smear.''HPV testing to detect human papillomavirus infection has replaced the Pap smear as an accepted or preferred form of screening. According the American Cancer Society, ""Those aged 25 to 65 should have a primary ''HPV test'' every 5 years. If primary HPV testing is not available, screening may be done with either a co-test that combines an HPV test with a Papanicolaou (Pap) test every 5 years or a Pap test alone every 3 years.""''Further, the ACS recommends that women over age 65 who have had regular screening in the past 10 years with normal results and no history of CIN2 or more serious diagnosis within the past 25 years stop cervical ''cancer screening''.''The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends ""screening for cervical cancer every 3 years with cervical cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years. For women aged 30 to 65 years, the USPSTF recommends screening every 3 years with cervical cytology alone, every 5 years with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing alone, or every 5 years with hrHPV testing in combination with cytology (cotesting).""''For women whose initial screening result is unclear or abnormal, other diagnostic tests are used:'   Colposcopy is a gynecological procedure that illuminates and magnifies the vulva, vaginal walls, and uterine cervix in order to detect and examine abnormalities of these structures. A colposcope is a microscope that resembles a pair of binoculars. The instrument has a range of magnification lenses. It also has color filters that allow the physician to detect surface abnormalities of the cervix, vagina and vulva. A Biopsy is a tissue sample obtained for examination under the microscope. A biopsy is taken from suspicious surface areas seen during colposcopy. A diagnosis can only be made from a tissue biopsy."
How do medical professionals classify cervical dysplasia?,"'Pap smear reports are based on a medical terminology system called The Bethesda System that was developed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland in 1988 and modified in 2001. The major categories for abnormal Pap smears reported in the Bethesda Systems are as follows:''When precancerous changes are seen in tissue biopsies of the cervix, the term cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is used. ""Intraepithelial"" refers to the fact that the abnormal cells are present within the lining, or epithelial, tissue of the cervix. ""Neoplasia"" refers to the abnormal growth of cells.''CIN is classified according to the extent to which the abnormal, or dysplastic, cells are seen in the cervical lining tissue:' ASC-US: This abbreviation stands for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. The word ""squamous"" describes the thin, flat cells that lie on the surface of the cervix. One of two choices are added at the end of ASC: ASC-US, which means undetermined significance, or ASC-H, which means cannot exclude HSIL (see below). LSIL: This abbreviation stands for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. This means changes characteristic of mild dysplasia are observed in the cervical cells. HSIL: This abbreviation stands for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. And refers to the fact that cells with a moderate to severe degree of dysplasia are seen. CIN 1 refers to the presence of dysplasia confined to the basal third of the cervical lining, or epithelium (formerly called mild dysplasia). This is considered to be a low-grade lesion. CIN 2 is considered to be a high-grade lesion. It refers to dysplastic cellular changes confined to the basal two-thirds of the lining tissue (formerly called moderate dysplasia). CIN 3 is also a high grade lesion. It refers to precancerous changes in the cells encompassing greater than two-thirds of the cervical lining thickness, including full-thickness lesions that were formerly referred to as severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ."
What are treatments for cervical dysplasia?,"'(These treatments are for CIN precancerous conditions only and are not appropriate for invasive cancer conditions.)''Most women with low grade (mild) dysplasia (CIN1 when the diagnosis is confirmed and all abnormal areas have been visualized), will frequently undergo spontaneous regression of the mild dysplasia without treatment. In others, it will persist, and in some, it will progress. Therefore, monitoring without specific treatment is often indicated in this group. Treatment is appropriate for women diagnosed with high-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN II and CIN III).''Treatments for cervical dysplasia fall into two general categories: destruction (ablation) of the abnormal area and removal (resection). Both types of treatment are equally effective.''The destruction (ablation) procedures are carbon dioxide laser, electrocautery, and ''cryotherapy''. The removal (resection) procedures are ''loop electrosurgical excision procedure'' (''LEEP''), ''cold'' knife conization, and ''hysterectomy''. Treatment is not done at the time of the initial colposcopy, since the treatment depends on the subsequent diagnosis of the biopsies obtained.'  "
Carbon dioxide laser photoablation,"'This procedure, which is also known as CO2 laser, uses an invisible beam of coherent light to vaporize the abnormal area. A local anesthetic may be given to numb the area prior to the laser treatment. A clear ''vaginal discharge'' and ''spotting'' of blood may occur for a few weeks after the procedure. The complication rate of this procedure is very low. The most common complications are narrowing (stenosis) of the cervical opening and delayed bleeding. This treatment destroys the abnormal area.' "
Cryotherapy,"'Like the laser treatment, cryotherapy is an ablation therapy. It uses nitrous oxide to freeze the abnormal area. This technique, however, is not optimal for large areas or areas where abnormalities are already advanced or severe. After the procedure, women may experience a significant watery vaginal discharge for several weeks. As with laser ablation, significant complications of this procedure are rare. They include narrowing (stenosis) of the cervix and delayed bleeding. Cryotherapy also destroys the abnormal area and is generally felt to be inappropriate for women with advanced cervical disease.' "
Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP),"'Loop electrosurgical excision procedure, also known as LEEP, is an inexpensive, simple technique that uses a radio-frequency current to remove abnormal areas. It is similar, but less extensive than a cone biopsy. It has an advantage over the destructive techniques in that an intact tissue sample for analysis can be obtained for pathologic study. Vaginal discharge and spotting may occur after this procedure. Complications rarely occur in women undergoing LEEP, and include cervical narrowing (stenosis) that may interfere with ''fertility'' and potentially cause premature ''labor'' in a subsequent ''pregnancy''.' "
Cold knife cone biopsy (conization),"'Cone biopsy (conization) was once the primary procedure used to treat cervical dysplasia, but the other methods have now replaced it for this purpose. However, when a physician cannot view the entire area that needs to be seen during colposcopy, a cone biopsy is typically recommended. It is also recommended if additional tissue sampling is needed to obtain more information regarding the diagnosis. This technique allows the size and shape of the sample to be tailored to the condition. Cone biopsy has a slightly higher risk of cervical complications than the other treatments, which can include postoperative bleeding and cervical narrowing (stenosis) that may interfere with fertility and also premature ''labor''. ' "
Hysterectomy,'Hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. Hysterectomy may be used if dysplasia recurs after any of the other treatment procedures.' 
What is the prognosis (outlook) for cervical dysplasia?,"'Low-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN1) often spontaneously resolves without treatment, but careful monitoring and follow-up testing is required. Both ablation and resection of cervical dysplasia are effective for a majority of women with dysplasia. However, there is a chance of recurrence in some women after treatment, requiring additional treatment. Therefore, monitoring is necessary. When untreated, high grade cervical dysplasia may progress to cervical cancer over time.'  "
Is it possible to prevent cervical dysplasia?,"'A vaccine is available against nine common HPV types associated with the development of dysplasia and cervical cancer. This vaccine (''Gardasil'' 9) has received FDA approval for use in women between 9 and 26 years of age and confers immunity against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.''Abstinence from sexual activity can prevent the spread of HPVs that are transmitted via sexual contact. HPV infection can be transmitted from the mother to infant in the birth canal, since some studies have identified genital HPV infection in populations of young children. Hand-genital and oral-genital transmission of HPV has also been documented and is another means of transmission.''HPV is transmitted by direct genital or skin contact. The virus is not found in or spread by bodily fluids, and HPV is not found in blood or organs harvested for transplantation. ''Condom'' use seems to decrease the risk of transmission of HPV during sexual activity but does not completely prevent HPV infection. ''Spermicides'' and hormonal ''birth control methods'' do not prevent the spread of HPV infection.' "
What is persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)?,"'Persistent depressive disorder, as it is called in the current standard diagnostic manual, the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' (''DSM-5''), was called dysthymia in previous diagnostic manuals (for example, ''DSM-IV''). This illness is a chronic form of ''depression'' that tends to be characterized by ''fatigue'', low energy, low self-esteem, and changes in appetite or ''sleep''. This mood (affective) disorder tends to be less severe than major ''depression'', which can also be characterized by a lack of interest in usually enjoyable activities (anhedonia), feeling sped up or slowed down, as well as thoughts of death or wanting to die. However, persistent depressive disorder is characterized by chronic depression, in that despite potential brief periods of normal mood, symptoms last at least two years at a time in adults and more than one year at a time in children and adolescents.''The impact of persistent depressive disorder to people with the disorder, their families, and society is significant. For example, people with this depressive disorder can be twice as likely to develop ''dementia'' and therefore be unproductive and otherwise unable to care for themselves or others compared to those without persistent depressive disorder. Given these significant negative outcomes, this illness should be seriously addressed rather than being seen as merely a low-grade version of major depression. The potential consequences of persistent depressive disorder also further debunk the now-outdated way of classifying less severe forms of depression as neurotic depression and more severe ''depressive episodes'' as psychotic depression.''Statistics on persistent depressive disorder include its affecting 3%-6% of the population and up to one-third of those people receiving outpatient mental health services in the United States. It tends to afflict women more often than men, those who are unmarried more than those who are married, and has been assessed more often in high-income countries. While elderly individuals seem to be less likely to experience a major depressive episode compared to younger people, senior citizens are more at risk for developing the less severe but more chronic persistent depressive disorder. In contrast to the prevalence of major depression in ethnic groups in the United States, persistent depressive disorder tends to be more common in African-Americans than in Caucasians and some Hispanic-Americans in most age groups. In the elderly, older, non-Hispanic Caucasians are thought to experience persistent depressive disorder and other depressive disorders more often than African-American and Asian people but of equal frequency as older Latino individuals.''Persistent depressive disorder usually co-occurs (is comorbid) with other disorders, most commonly with major depression, ''anxiety'', personality, or somatic symptom and related disorders, as well as with ''alcohol'' or other ''drug abuse''.' "
What are causes and risk factors for persistent depressive disorder?,"'As with most mental health disorders, persistent depressive disorder does not have a single definitive cause. Rather, people with this illness tend to have a number of biological, psychological, and environmental contributing factors that contribute to its occurrence. Different parts of the brain of people with persistent depressive disorder tend to respond differently to negative emotions like fear and sadness, as well as to some physical sensations compared to the brains of people without the disorder. Genetic risk factors for developing persistent depressive disorder include the tendency for those who suffer from this illness to have a family member who also suffers from either persistent depressive disorder, major depressive disorder, or a personality disorder. Significant ''stress'' during childhood or adulthood (like exposure to neglect, abuse, or community violence) and having negative social supports are some psychosocial risk factors for persistent depressive disorder.'  "
What are persistent depressive disorder symptoms and signs?,"'In order to meet criteria for the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder, a person must experience ''depressed'' mood, which can look like (present as) a loss of interest or general discontent (may be irritability or excessive anger in children and adolescents) most of every day, more days than not for at least two years in a row in adults, and one year for children and teens. The persistent depressive disorder sufferer will not have more than a two-month symptom-free period during the course of the illness and must experience at least two of the following signs and symptoms of this type of depression:''A person with persistent depressive disorder can also have major depression but does not suffer from ''cyclothymia'', never has the ''mania'' or ''hypomania'' of ''bipolar disorder'', and does not have symptoms that are better explained by another mental health problem, the effects of a medication, drug of abuse, or medical condition.'   Poor appetite or overeating Insomnia or excessive sleeping (hypersomnia) Fatigue or other physical symptoms; slowness in thought and completing daily activities Low self-esteem/excessive self-criticism Poor concentration or making decisions Hopelessness"
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose persistent depressive disorder? What types of doctors treat persistent depressive disorder?,"'Many health care providers may help make the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder and treat the condition, including licensed mental health therapists, pediatricians, or other primary care providers, specialists whom one sees for a medical condition, emergency physicians, physician assistants, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychiatric nurses and nurse practitioners, and social workers. One of these professionals will likely perform or refer for an extensive medical interview and physical examination as part of determining the diagnosis. Persistent depressive disorder may be associated with a number of other medical conditions, the result of exposure to alcohol or other drugs of abuse or as part of a general medical condition, so routine laboratory tests are often performed during the initial evaluation to rule out other medical causes of symptoms. Occasionally, an X-ray, scan, or other imaging study may be needed.''As part of the evaluation, the sufferer may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help assess the presence of depression. Thorough exploration for any history or presence of mental health symptoms will be conducted such that persistent depressive disorder can be distinguished from other types of depression like major depression, depressive symptoms in reaction to ''stress'' (adjustment disorder), or depressed mood as part of the ''mood swings'' of ''bipolar disorder'' or cyclothymic disorder. The mental health practitioner will also explore whether or not other forms of ''mental illness'' are present.'  "
What is the treatment for persistent depressive disorder? Are there any home remedies for persistent depressive disorder?,"'For people with mild persistent depressive disorder who want to try treatment without medication, there are a number of lifestyle changes and home/natural remedies that may be useful for coping with the condition. Healthy lifestyle changes that may help alleviate persistent depressive disorder include getting enough ''sleep'', establishing a healthy ''diet'', getting regular physical ''exercise'"", setting small goals for oneself, limiting alcohol intake and abstaining from abusing any other drug. Specific support in the workplace has been found to positively affect outcomes for people with persistent depressive disorder. Some natural remedies that have found some success in treating mild depression include St. John's wort and SAM-e. However, these treatments have variable results and may result in side effects so should only be taken in cooperation with a physician.""'The treatment of moderate to severe persistent depressive disorder is found to be most effective when it includes both medication treatment and at least 18 sessions of talk therapy (psychotherapy), but medications tend to be more effective compared to therapy alone.'""Medications that increase the amount of the neurochemical serotonin in the brain are the most common group of medical treatments used to address persistent depressive disorder since brain serotonin levels are often thought to be low in depression. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs (SSRIs) work by maintaining high serotonin levels in the synapses (spaces between nerve cells across which nerve signals are transmitted). These drugs do this by preventing the reuptake of serotonin back into the sending nerve cell. The reuptake of serotonin is responsible for turning off the production of new serotonin. Therefore, the message to continue making serotonin keeps on being sent. It is thought that this, in turn, helps stimulate (activate) cells that have been deactivated by persistent depressive disorder, thereby relieving the person's symptoms.""'SSRIs tend to have fewer side effects than the ''tricyclic antidepressants'' (TCAs) and ''monoamine oxidase inhibitors'' (''MAOIs''), two other classes of antidepressant drugs. SSRIs do not interact with the chemical tyramine in foods, as do the MAOIs, and therefore do not require the dietary restrictions of the MAOIs. Also, SSRIs are unlikely to cause ''orthostatic hypotension'' (sudden, significant drop in ''blood pressure'' when sitting up or standing) and ''heart''-rhythm disturbances, like the TCAs do. Therefore, SSRIs are often the first-line treatment for persistent depressive disorder. Examples of SSRIs include ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), ''fluvoxamine'' (''Luvox''), ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro''), ''vortioxetine'' (Trintellix), and vilazodone (Viibryd).''SSRIs are generally well tolerated, and side effects are usually mild. The most common side effects are ''nausea'', ''diarrhea'', agitation, ''insomnia'', and ''headache''. However, these side effects generally go away within the first month of SSRI use. Some patients experience sexual side effects, such as decreased sexual desire (''decreased libido''), delayed ''orgasm'', or an inability to have an orgasm. Some patients experience ''tremors'' with SSRIs. The so-called serotonergic (meaning caused by serotonin) syndrome is a serious neurologic condition associated with the use of SSRIs. It is characterized by high ''fevers'', ''seizures'', and heart-rhythm disturbances. This condition is very rare and tends to occur only in very ill psychiatric patients taking multiple psychiatric medications.'""All patients are unique biochemically. Therefore, the occurrence of side effects or the lack of adequate results with one SSRI does not mean that another medication in this group will not be beneficial. However, if someone in the patient's family has had a positive response to a particular drug, that medication may be the preferable one to try first.""'Dual-action ''antidepressants'' (SNRIs) are thought to affect both serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain. Examples of that class of medications include ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''), and levomilnacipran (Fetzima). While generally well tolerated, side effects of these medications can include ''flu-like symptoms'' (body aches, ''tiredness'', ''dizziness''), especially when doses are missed.''Atypical antidepressants are not TCAs, SSRIs, MAOIs, or SNRIs, but they are effective in treating depression for many people nonetheless. More specifically, they increase the level of certain neurochemicals in the brain synapses. Examples of atypical antidepressants include ''trazodone'' (''Desyrel'' or Oleptro) and ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin'').''Cognitive behavioral therapy'' (CBT): This has been found to be effective as part of treatment for depression. This approach helps to alleviate depression and reduce the likelihood it will come back by helping the dysthymia sufferer change his or her way of thinking about certain issues. In CBT, the therapist uses three techniques to accomplish these goals:'   Didactic component: This phase helps to set up positive expectations for therapy and promote the person's engagement in the treatment process. Cognitive component: This helps to identify the thoughts and assumptions that influence the dysthymic individual's behaviors, particularly those that may predispose the sufferer to being depressed. Behavioral component: This employs behavior-modification techniques to teach the person more effective ways for dealing with problems."
"Is it possible to prevent 
persistent depressive disorder?","'Attempts at prevention of persistent depressive disorder tend to address both specific and nonspecific risk factors and strengthen protective factors. Such programs often use cognitive behavioral and/or interpersonal approaches, as well as family based prevention strategies because research indicates that these interventions are the most helpful.''The inverse of most risk factors, protective factors for depression include preventing exposure to neglect, abuse, community violence or other ''trauma'"", having the involvement of supportive family, strengthening family and peer relationships, promoting well-being in general, and developing healthy coping and emotional regulation skills that are used regularly, on a day-to-day basis. Children of a dysthymic parent tend to be more resilient when the child is more able to focus on age-appropriate tasks in their lives and on their relationships, as well as being able to understand their parent's illness. For depressed adults, their children seem to be more protected from developing the illness when the parent is able to demonstrate a commitment to ""'parenting'' and to relationships.' "
What is the prognosis of persistent depressive disorder?,"'Around half of the people who have persistent depressive disorder have a suboptimal response to the first antidepressant drug they receive and therefore are considered treatment resistant. Furthermore, about two-thirds of people with persistent depressive disorder are thought to continue having some symptoms of the disorder 10 years later. These individuals are at risk for long-term complications like having marital problems, generally having low social support, and an overall compromised life adjustment. It is thought that these risks are greater for persistent depressive disorder sufferers than even people with major depression because of the chronic nature of the illness and the greater influence of life stressors in the development of persistent depressive disorder. Having another mental health condition, a history of trauma, or history of poor family relationships during childhood further negatively impacts the prognosis of people with dysthymic disorder. The age that someone first develops this condition is also important to his or her prognosis. Those who experience their first episode of a compromised life adjustment prior to 21 years of age tend to have a worse prognosis than people who first have persistent depressive disorder at 21 years of age or older.''Medically, the presence of depressive symptoms can increase the mortality (death) risk in older people generally, as well as in those who have had a ''heart attack'' or who have even mild ''dementia'', specifically. Persistent depressive disorder sufferers are at higher risk of suffering a number of medical problems, including ''stroke''.' "
Are there support groups for people with persistent depressive disorder?,"'DepNet.org''MDJunction.com''National Alliance for the Mentally Ill'' (NAMI)''2101 Wilson Boulevard Suite 302''Arlington, VA 22201''HelpLine: 800-950-NAMI [6264]'  "
What is dystonia?,"'Dystonia is a disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause slow repetitive movements or abnormal postures. The movements may be painful, and some individuals with dystonia may have a ''tremor'' or other neurologic features. There are several different forms of dystonia that may affect only one muscle, groups of muscles, or muscles throughout the body. Some forms of dystonia are genetic but the cause for the majority of cases is not known.' "
What are the symptoms of dystonia?,"'Dystonia can affect many different parts of the body, and the symptoms are different depending upon the form of dystonia. Early symptoms may include a foot cramp or a tendency for one foot to turn or drag -- either sporadically or after ''running'' or ''walking'' some distance -- or a worsening in handwriting after writing several lines.  In other instances, the neck may turn or pull involuntarily, especially when the person is tired or under ''stress''. Sometimes both eyes might blink rapidly and uncontrollably; other times, spasms will cause the eyes to close.  Symptoms may also include ''tremor'' or difficulties speaking.  In some cases, dystonia can affect only one specific action, while allowing others to occur unimpeded.  For example, a musician may have dystonia when using her hand to play an instrument, but not when using the same hand to type.  The initial symptoms can be very mild and may be noticeable only after prolonged exertion, stress, or ''fatigue''. Over a period of time, the symptoms may become more noticeable or widespread; sometimes, however, there is little or no progression. Dystonia typically is not associated with problems thinking or understanding, but ''depression'' and ''anxiety'' may be present.'  "
What do researchers know about dystonia?,"""The cause of dystonia is not known. Researchers believe that dystonia results from an abnormality in or damage to the basal ganglia or other brain regions that control movement. There may be abnormalities in the brain's ability to process a group of chemicals called neurotransmitters that help cells in the brain communicate with each other.  There also may be abnormalities in the way the brain processes information and generates commands to move.  In most cases, no abnormalities are visible using ""'magnetic resonance imaging'' or other diagnostic imaging.''The dystonias can be divided into three groups: idiopathic, genetic, and acquired.' Idiopathic dystonia refers to dystonia that does not have a clear cause. Many instances of dystonia are idiopathic. There are several genetic causes of dystonia.  Some forms appear to be inherited in a dominant manner, which means only one parent who carries the defective gene is needed to pass the disorder to their child.  Each child of a parent having the abnormal gene will have a 50 percent chance of carrying the defective gene. It is important to note the symptoms may vary widely in type and severity even among members of the same family. In some instances, persons who inherit the defective gene may not develop dystonia.  Having one mutated gene appears to be sufficient to cause the chemical imbalances that may lead to dystonia, but other genetic or even environmental factors may play a role. Knowing the pattern of inheritance can help families understand the risk of passing dystonia along to future generations. Acquired dystonia, also called secondary dystonia, results from environmental or other damage to the brain, or from exposure to certain types of medications. Some causes of acquired dystonia include birth injury (including hypoxia, a lack of oxygen to the brain, and neonatal brain hemorrhage), certain infections, reactions to certain drugs, heavy metal or carbon monoxide poisoning, trauma, or stroke. Dystonia can be a symptom of other diseases, some of which may be hereditary. Acquired dystonia often plateaus and does not spread to other parts of the body.  Dystonia that occurs as a result of medications often ceases if the medications are stopped quickly."
When do symptoms of dystonia occur?,"'Dystonia can occur at any age, but is often described as either early, or childhood, onset versus adult onset.''Early-onset dystonia often begins with symptoms in the limbs and may progress to involve other regions. Some symptoms tend to occur after periods of exertion and/or fluctuate over the course of the day.''Adult-onset dystonia usually is located in one or adjacent parts of the body, most often involving the neck and/or facial muscles.  Acquired dystonia can affect other regions of the body.''Dystonias often progress through various stages. Initially, dystonic movements may be intermittent and appear only during voluntary movements or stress. Later, individuals may show dystonic postures and movements while walking and ultimately even while they are relaxed. Dystonia can be associated with fixed postures and shortening of tendons.' "
How are the dystonias classified?,"'One way to classify the dystonias is based upon the regions of the body which they affect:''There are several different forms of dystonia.  Some of the more common focal forms are:''Cervical dystonia, also called spasmodic torticollis or torticollis, is the most common of the focal dystonias. In cervical dystonia, the muscles in the neck that control the position of the head are affected, causing the head to turn to one side or be pulled forward or backward. Sometimes the shoulder is pulled up.  Cervical dystonia can occur at any age, although most individuals first experience symptoms in middle age. It often begins slowly and usually reaches a plateau over a few months or years. About 10 percent of those with torticollis may experience a spontaneous remission, but unfortunately the remission may not be lasting.''Blepharospasm, the second most common focal dystonia, is the involuntary, forcible contraction of the muscles controlling eye blinks. The first symptoms may be increased blinking, and usually both eyes are affected. Spasms may cause the eyelids to close completely, causing ""functional ''blindness''"" even though the eyes are healthy and vision is normal.''Cranio-facial dystonia is a term used to describe dystonia that affects the muscles of the head, face, and neck (such as blepharospasm). The term Meige syndrome is sometimes applied to cranio-facial dystonia accompanied by blepharospasm.  Oromandibular dystonia affects the muscles of the jaw, lips, and tongue. This dystonia may cause difficulties with opening and closing the jaw, and speech and swallowing can be affected. Spasmodic dysphonia, also called laryngeal dystonia, involves the muscles that control the vocal cords, resulting in strained or breathy speech.'""Task-specific dystonias are focal dystonias that tend to occur only when undertaking a particular repetitive activity.  Examples include writer's cramp that affects the muscles of the hand and sometimes the forearm, and only occurs during handwriting.  Similar focal dystonias have also been called typist's cramp, pianist's cramp, and musician's cramp. Musician's dystonia is a term used to classify focal dystonias affecting musicians, specifically their ability to play an instrument or to perform. It can involve the hand in keyboard or string players, the mouth and lips in wind players, or the voice in singers.""'In addition, there are forms of dystonia that may have a genetic cause:''Recently, researchers have identified another genetic cause of dystonia which is due to mutations in the DYT6 gene.  Dystonia caused by DYT6 mutations often presents as cranio-facial dystonia, cervical dystonia, or arm dystonia. Rarely, a leg is affected at the onset.''Many other genes that cause dystonic syndromes have been found, and numerous genetic variants are known to date. Some important genetic causes of dystonia include mutations in the following genes:  DYT3, which causes dystonia associated with ''parkinsonism''; DYT5 (GTP cyclohydrolase 1), which is associated with dopa-responsive dystonia (Segawa disease); DYT6 (THAP1), associated with several clinical presentations of dystonia; DYT11, which causes dystonia associated with myoclonus (brief contractions of muscles); and DYT12, which causes rapid onset dystonia associated with parkinsonism.' ralized dystonia affects most or all of the body. Focal dystonia is localized to a specific part of the body. Multifocal dystonia involves two or more unrelated body parts. Segmental dystonia affects two or more adjacent parts of the body. Hemidystonia involves the arm and leg on the same side of the body. DYT1 dystonia is a rare form of dominantly inherited generalized dystonia that can be caused by a mutation in the DYT1 gene. This form of dystonia typically begins in childhood, affects the limbs first, and progresses, often causing significant disability.  Because the gene's effects are so variable, some people who carry a mutation in the DYT1 gene may not develop dystonia. Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), also known as Segawa's disease, is another form of dystonia that can have a genetic cause. Individuals with DRD typically experience onset during childhood and have progressive difficulty with walking. Symptoms characteristically fluctuate and are worse late in the day and after exercise. Some forms of DRD are due to mutations in the DYT5 gene. Patients with this disorder have dramatic improvements in symptoms after treatment with levodopa, a medication commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease."
What treatments are available for dystonias?,"""Currently, there are no medications to prevent dystonia or slow its progression.  There are, however, several treatment options that can ease some of the symptoms of dystonia, so physicians can select a therapeutic approach based on each individual's symptoms.""   Botulinum toxin. Botulinum injections often are the most effective treatment for the focal dystonias. Injections of small amounts of this chemical into affected muscles prevents muscle contractions and can provide temporary improvement in the abnormal postures and movements that characterize dystonia. First used to treat blepharospasm, such injections are now widely used for treating other focal dystonias. The toxin decreases muscle spasms by blocking release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which normally causes muscles to contract.  The effect typically is seen a few days after the injections and can last for several months before the injections must be repeated.  The details of the treatment will vary among individuals. Medications. Several classes of drugs that affect different neurotransmitters may be effective for various forms of dystonia. These medications are used “off-label”, meaning they are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat different disorders or conditions but have not been specifically approved to treat dystonia. The response to drugs varies among individuals and even in the same person over time. These drugs include: Anticholinergic agents block the effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Drugs in this group include trihexyphenidyl and benztropine. Sometimes these medications can be sedating or cause difficulties with memory, especially at higher dosages and in older individuals.  These side effects can limit their usefulness. Other side effects such as dry mouth and constipation can usually be managed with dietary changes or other medications.  GABAergic agents are drugs that regulate the neurotransmitter GABA.  These medications include the benzodiazepines such as diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam, and baclofen.  Drowsiness is their common side effect. Dopaminergic agents act on the dopamine system and the neurotransmitter dopamine, which helps control muscle movement. Some individuals may benefit from drugs that block the effects of dopamine, such as tetrabenazine. Side effects (such as weight gain and involuntary and repetitive muscle movements) can restrict the use of these medications.  Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is a specific form of dystonia that most commonly affects children, and often can be well managed with levodopa. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be recommended for some individuals with dystonia, especially when medications do not sufficiently alleviate symptoms or the side effects are too severe. DBS involves implanting small electrodes that are connected to a pulse generator into specific brain regions that control movement.  Controlled amounts of electricity are sent into the exact region of the brain that generates the dystonic symptoms and interfere with and block the electrical signals that cause the symptoms. DBS should be conducted by an interdisciplinary team involving neurologists, neurosurgeons, psychiatrists, and neuropsychologists, as there is intensive follow-up and adjustments to optimize an individual's DBS settings. Physical and other therapies may be helpful for individuals with dystonia and may be an adjunct to other therapeutic approaches.  Speech therapy and/or voice therapy can be quite helpful for some affected by spasmodic dysphonia. Physical therapy, the use of splints, stress management, and biofeedback also may help individuals with certain forms of dystonia."
What research is being done on dystonias?,"'The ultimate goals of research are to find the cause(s) of the dystonias so that they can be prevented, and to find ways to cure or more effectively treat people who are affected. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is the Federal agency with primary responsibility for brain and neuromuscular research. NINDS sponsors research on dystonia both in its facilities at the NIH and through grants to medical centers and institutions throughout the country. Scientists at other NIH institutes also conduct research that may benefit individuals with dystonia.  Scientists at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) are studying improved treatments for speech and voice disorders associated with dystonia. The National Eye Institute (NEI) supports work on the study of blepharospasm and related problems, and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of ''Child Health'' and Human Development (NICHD) supports work on dystonia, including the rehabilitation for the disorder. ''Scientists at NINDS laboratories have conducted detailed investigations of the patterns of muscle activity, imaging studies of brain activity, and physiological studies of the brain in persons with dystonia.''Treatment studies, using surgery or medication, are being conducted in many centers, including the NIH. To learn more about clinical studies on dystonia, please go to ''www.clinicaltrials.gov''.''Recently, the Dystonia Coalition—a clinical research network for dystonia— has been established with support from the NINDS and the NIH Office of Rare Disease Research as part of the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network. For more information on the clinical studies and patient registry established by the Dystonia Coalition, see ''http://rarediseasesnetwork.epi.usf.edu/dystonia/''.''The search for genes responsible for some forms of dystonia continues. In 1989 a team of researchers mapped a gene for early-onset torsion dystonia to chromosome 9; the gene was subsequently named DYT1.  In 1997 the team sequenced the DYT1 gene and found that it codes for a previously unknown protein now called ""torsin A.""  The discovery of the DYT1 gene and the torsin A protein provide the opportunity for ''prenatal'' testing, allow doctors to make a specific diagnosis in some cases of dystonia, and permit the investigation of molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to disease.'""The discovery of the mutation in “torsin A' has enabled scientists to study animal models into which the mutated gene has been introduced. Through research with patients informed by the latest discoveries from genetics and basic neuroscience, scientists and doctors hope to better understand dystonia and find more effective treatments.""
