Questions,Answer
What are antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA)?,"'Between 95 and 98% of patients with ''primary biliary cirrhosis'' (''PBC'') have autoantibodies (antibodies to self) in their blood that react with the inner lining of mitochondria. These autoantibodies are called antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA). Mitochondria are the energy factories present inside all of our cells, not just the cells of the ''liver'' or bile ducts. (The mitochondria use the oxygen carried in the blood from the ''lungs'' as a fuel to generate energy.) AMA actually bind to protein antigens that are contained in multienzyme complexes (packages of enzymes) within the inner lining of the mitochondria. These multienzyme complexes produce key chemical reactions necessary for life. The complexes are referred to as multienzyme because they are made up of multiple enzyme units.''AMA specifically react against a component of this multienzyme complex called E2. In PBC, AMA preferentially react with the E2 component of one of the multienzymes that is called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Accordingly, the antigen is designated as PDC-E2. The practical importance of all of this is that the PDC-E2 antigen is now used, as discussed below, in a diagnostic test for PBC. The PDC-E2 antigen is also referred to as M2, a term introduced to designate it as the second mitochondrial antigen discovered by researchers interested in PBC.'  "
Do AMA cause the destruction of the bile ducts in PBC?,"'In as much as the bile ducts are the main targets of destruction in PBC, the question was asked whether the AMA reacts with the epithelial cells that line the bile ducts. So, investigators prepared antibodies to PDC-E2. As expected, they found that these antibodies bound to the mitochondria within the cells. But, sure enough, recent information suggests that these AMA autoantibodies also bind to PDC-E2 that lies outside the mitochondria, yet within the epithelial cells lining the bile ducts.''This accumulation of PDC-E2 within the biliary epithelial cells is observed exclusively in the livers of patients with PBC, and not in normal livers or in livers from patients with any other types of ''liver disease''. Interestingly, it was also observed in the livers of those two to five percent of PBC patients who do not have AMA in their blood (AMA-negative PBC). Furthermore, intense binding of these antibodies to biliary epithelial cells was also found to be the earliest indication of recurrence of PBC in a transplanted liver. (PBC is sometimes treated by liver transplantation.)''Nevertheless, no evidence exists that the AMA itself causes the destruction of the biliary epithelial cells lining the small bile ducts. Neither the presence nor the amount (titer) of AMA in the blood appears to be related to the inflammatory destruction of the bile ducts. Indeed, immunization of animals with PDC-E2 antigen results in production of AMA without any liver or bile duct damage (pathology).' "
How is the blood test for AMA done?,"""The most economical test for AMA applies diluted samples of a patient's serum onto tissue sections from rat stomach or kidney in the laboratory. (Remember that mitochondria are present in virtually all cells, not just the cells of the liver and bile ducts.) Serum antibodies that attach (bind) to mitochondrial membranes within the tissue cells can then be observed with a microscope. The most dilute sample of serum showing this binding reaction is reported, using the term titer. The titer indicates the most dilute serum sample that reacts with the tissue mitochondria. A higher titer means there is a greater amount of AMA in the serum.""'The antigen recognized by AMA in patients with PBC is now known to be PDC-E2 and is also often referred to as the M2 antigen. So, newly developed tests for antibodies that bind to PDC-E2 are more specific and are now available to confirm the diagnosis of PBC.' "
What is the value of the AMA blood test?,"'AMA are detectable in the serum in 95 to 98% of patients with PBC. So, AMA are tremendously important as a diagnostic marker in patients with PBC. The AMA titers in PBC are almost universally greater than or equal to 1 to 40. This means that a serum sample diluted with 40 times its original volume still contains enough antimitochondrial antibodies to be detected in the binding reaction. A positive AMA with a titer of at least 1:40 in an adult with an elevated ''alkaline phosphatase'' in the blood is highly specific for a diagnosis of PBC.' "
What is macular degeneration?,"'Macular degeneration is a common, painless eye condition in which the central portion of the retina deteriorates and does not function adequately.' "
What is the retina?,"'The retina is the light sensitive tissue located in the back of the eye. It is like the film in a camera, recording the images we see and sending them via the ''optic nerve'' from the eye to the brain. The retina almost instantly converts light images into electrical impulses through a chemical reaction. The retina then sends these impulses or signal, to the brain, where we interpret what we see, process the visual information, and relate what we see to the rest of our environment.' "
What is the macula?,"'The macula is a small portion of the retina located in the central portion of the retina. The macula is responsible for central vision (straight-ahead vision) and provides the ability to see fine detail in your direct line of sight. We use the macula of each eye to have the clear vision that allows us to read, drive a car, and recognize faces or colors. The non-macular areas of the retina provide us with both our side vision and best night vision.' "
What is age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,"'While there are many causes of macular degeneration, including genetic abnormalities such as Stargardt disease, ''age-related macular degeneration'' (AMD or ARMD) is by far the most common type. AMD is a disease associated with ''aging'' that gradually destroys the sharp central vision needed for seeing objects clearly and for common daily tasks such as reading and driving. In some cases, AMD advances so slowly that people notice little change in their vision. In others, the disease progresses faster and may lead to a ''loss of vision'' in one or both eyes. AMD is the leading cause of ''vision loss'' in Americans 60 years of age and older. AMD usually affects both eyes, although the clinical appearance and degree of visual loss may vary a great deal between the two eyes.''AMD occurs in two forms. ""Wet"" age-related macular degeneration is less common but more aggressive in its progression to severe central vision loss. ""Dry"" age-related macular degeneration is the more common type and is more slowly progressive in causing visual loss.''Doctors classify AMD as to its severity, using terms such as mild, moderate, or severe. These terms are subjective and not based on specific characteristics.'  "
What is wet age-related macular degeneration?,"""Wet AMD occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow from the choroid (the layer of blood vessels between the retina and the outer firm coat of the eye called the sclera) under and into the macular portion of the retina. These new blood vessels (known as choroidal neovascularization or CNV) tend to be very fragile and often leak blood and fluid. The blood and fluid raise the macula from its normal place at the back of the eye, interfere with the retina's function, and cause the central vision to blur. Under these circumstances, vision loss may be rapid and severe. Some patients, however, do not notice visual changes despite the onset of CNV. Therefore, periodic eye examinations are very important for patients at risk for CNV.""'Once CNV has developed in one eye, whether there is a visual loss or not, the other eye is at relatively high risk for the same change.''The CNV of all wet AMD is potentially a cause of significant visual loss, whether or not there is major visual decrease at the time of diagnosis. Wet AMD does not have specific stages like dry AMD. The wet form generally leads to significantly more vision loss than the dry form.''All people who have the dry form of AMD are at risk for development of the wet form. Most people who have the wet form had the dry form first. The dry form can advance and cause vision loss without turning into the wet form. The dry form also suddenly can turn into the wet form. Currently, there is no certain way to predict if or when the dry form will turn into the wet form.' "
What are retinal drusen?,"'Retinal drusen are yellow deposits under the retina. They often appear in people over 60 years of age. Your ''eye care'' professional can detect drusen during a comprehensive dilated eye exam.'""Drusen alone do not usually cause vision loss. In fact, scientists are unclear about the connection between drusen and AMD. It is not clear whether an increase in the size or number of drusen raises a person's risk of developing either advanced dry AMD or wet AMD."" "
What is dry age-related macular degeneration?,"'In dry AMD, the light sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. With less of the macula functioning, central vision diminishes. Dry AMD often occurs in just one eye at first. Later, it may affect the other eye. The cause of dry AMD is unknown.''Dry AMD has three stages (early, intermediate, or advanced), all of which may occur in one or both eyes. The amount and characteristics of the drusen that are present define these stages. People with early AMD have either several small drusen or a few medium-sized drusen. At this stage, there are no symptoms and no vision loss.''People with intermediate AMD have either many medium-sized drusen or one or more large drusen. Some people see a blurred spot in the center of their vision and may need more light for reading and other tasks.''In addition to drusen, people with advanced dry AMD have a breakdown of light-sensitive cells and supporting tissue in the central retinal area (geographic atrophy). Geographic atrophy can cause a blurred spot in the center of your vision. Over time, the blurred spot may get bigger and darker, taking more of your central vision. You may have difficulty reading or recognizing faces until they are very close to you.''The dry form is much more common than the wet form. In dry AMD, there is no CNV (abnormal new blood vessel formation under the retina) and no fluid or blood leakage into the retina (retinal swelling or bleeding).''Dry AMD can advance and cause vision loss without turning into wet AMD. Dry AMD can also rapidly transform into the wet form by the growth of new blood vessels.' "
What causes macular degeneration?,"'We do not know the precise cause for the development of AMD or ARMD. However, we do know that there are certain risk factors for the development of age-related macular degeneration.' "
What are risk factors for age-related macular degeneration?,"'The greatest risk factor is age. Although AMD may occur during middle age, studies show that people over age 60 are clearly at greater risk than other age groups. Middle-aged people have about a 2% risk of getting AMD while people over age 75 have a nearly 30% risk.''Other risk factors include ''smoking'', obesity, white race, female gender, a family history of macular degeneration, a ''diet'' low in fruit and vegetables, ''high blood pressure'', and elevated blood ''cholesterol''.'  "
What are macular degeneration symptoms?,"'Neither dry nor wet AMD cause any ''eye pain'' or ''floaters''.''The most common early symptom in dry AMD is blurred vision. As fewer cells in the macula are able to function, people will see details less clearly in front of them, such as faces or words in a book. Often this blurred vision will go away in brighter light. If the loss of these light-sensing cells becomes great, people may see a small black or gray blind spot in the middle of their field of vision.''Dry macular degeneration symptoms usually develop gradually and do not include total ''blindness''. However, the symptoms may worsen the quality of life by making reading, driving, and facial recognition difficult. Other symptoms may include decreased night vision, a decrease in the intensity or brightness of colors and increase in the haziness of overall vision. People often complain of eyestrain.''Dry macular degeneration may affect one eye or both eyes. If only one eye is affected, a person may not notice symptoms because the unaffected eye has no visual symptoms.''A person also may notice all of the above symptoms in the wet form of AMD. In addition, the most common symptom in wet macular degeneration is straight lines appearing crooked or wavy. This results when fluid from the leaking blood vessels gathers within and lifts the macula, distorting vision. Larger areas of gray or black in the central area of vision may also occur. The central vision may decrease over a short period.''Glasses do not improve the decrease in vision from macular degeneration. However, patients with macular degeneration often also have pre-existing ''myopia'', ''hyperopia'', ''astigmatism'', or/and ''presbyopia'', all of which may require glasses.' "
What are signs of macular degeneration?,"'In both dry and wet forms of macular degeneration, the ophthalmologist may find decreased visual clarity (acuity) with preservation of peripheral vision and changes in the central retina visible with the ophthalmoscope. An ophthalmologist may see areas of atrophic retina in the macula in both dry and wet forms of the disease. Your eye doctor may note fluid or exudative material under or within the retina in wet forms of macular degeneration.''Many other retinal diseases, such as ''diabetic retinopathy'' or ''retinitis pigmentosa'', can cause visual loss. These are unrelated to AMD.'  "
What type of specialist treats macular degeneration?,"'An ophthalmologist or optometrist can make a diagnosis of macular degeneration. An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who has specialized in the diagnosis and medical/surgical treatment of eye disease. In order to diagnose macular degeneration, an ophthalmologist dilates the pupils with eyedrops so that the retina can be clearly seen. Once the diagnosis of macular degeneration is made, any ophthalmologist can make distinguishing between the dry or wet variety. If you are found to have wet macular degeneration by a non-ophthalmologist, you may be referred to an ophthalmologist specializing in vitreo-retinal diseases. Vitreo-retinal subspecialists care for the majority of patients in the United States receiving treatment with intravitreal injections for wet AMD.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose macular degeneration?,"'Your ophthalmologist may suspect the diagnosis of AMD if you are over age 60 and have had recent changes in your central vision. To look for signs of the disease, he or she will use eyedrops to dilate, or enlarge, your pupils. Dilating the pupils allows your ophthalmologist to view the back of the eye better.''An ophthalmologist often diagnoses early AMD during a comprehensive eye exam in patients without significant symptoms. This eye exam includes having drops placed in your eyes to enlarge, or dilate, the pupils. Your ophthalmologist will carefully examine the central portion of the retina to determine the presence or absence of AMD using various illuminating and magnifying devices.''During the eye exam, your eye doctor may ask you to look at a checkerboard pattern called an Amsler grid. When looking at an Amsler grid with one eye, patients with AMD may notice that the straight lines of the checkerboard appear wavy or are missing.''Other diagnostic tests that your ophthalmologist may perform include retinal photography, fluorescein ''angiography'' and optical coherence tomography. All of these can help to differentiate between dry and wet forms of AMD and document the abnormalities so that progression and response to treatment can be better measured.' "
What is the treatment for wet macular degeneration?,"'Laser surgery, ''photodynamic therapy'', and injections into the eye treat wet AMD. None of these treatments is a permanent cure for wet AMD. The disease and loss of vision may progress despite treatment.''Laser surgery in the form of photocoagulation destroys the fragile, leaky blood vessels. A high-energy beam of light is aimed directly onto the new blood vessels to eradicate them, preventing further loss of vision. However, laser treatment may also destroy some surrounding healthy tissue and some vision. Because of this, a doctor can only treat eyes with new vessels away from the exact center of the vision. This represents only a small proportion of patients with AMD. Laser surgery is only effective in halting or slowing visual loss if the leaky blood vessels have developed away from the fovea, the central part of the macula. Even in treated cases, the risk of new blood vessels recurring after treatment is significant and further or other treatment may be necessary.''Photodynamic therapy uses a drug called verteporfin (''Visudyne'') injected into a vein of the arm. The ophthalmologist then directs a light of a specific wavelength into the eye to activate the drug adhering to the blood vessels in the eye. The activated drug destroys the new blood vessels and leads to a slower rate of vision decline. Photodynamic therapy may slow the rate of vision loss. It does not stop vision loss or restore vision in eyes already damaged by advanced AMD. Treatment results often are temporary. Retreatment may be necessary.''Within the last 14 years, injections into the eye with ''drugs'' specifically developed to stop the growth of new blood vessels have revolutionized the treatment of wet macular degeneration and have become the mainstay of treatment of wet macular degeneration. We have learned that a specific chemical called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is necessary for the new blood vessels to grow under the retina. An ophthalmologist can inject drugs that counter VEGF (anti-VEGF pharmacotherapy) into the eye to arrest development of new blood vessels and sometimes cause them to regress. These drugs include Eylea (aflibercept) and Lucentis (ranibizumab), both approved by the FDA for this indication, and ''Avastin'"" (bevacizumab), which is unapproved by the FDA for injection into the eye and requires compounding by a specialized pharmacy. Some physicians preferentially use Avastin because of its much lower cost. An ophthalmologist injects these drugs into the vitreous of the eye and may need to administer these injections as frequently as monthly. Careful observation of the eye on a monthly basis to determine the drug effect is necessary in the case of Lucentis and every other month in the case of Eylea. With this treatment, it's often possible to halt or slow vision loss, and some patients will even experience some improvement of vision. Newer drugs currently under review may need to be given less frequently. Photodynamic therapy and laser ablation have been largely, if not completely, abandoned in favor of VEGF inhibitors. New and perhaps more effective anti-VEGF medicines, including drugs that counter platelet derived growth factors and angiopoietins are currently in ""'clinical trials'"" and approaching the market. If diagnosed and treated early, the patient's chances of a better outcome are improved.""'In patients with far advanced macular degeneration on both eyes, surgery to implant a telescopic ''lens'"" in one eye is an option. The telescope implant, which surgically replaces the eye's natural lens, magnifies images while reducing the field of vision (peripheral vision). The telescopic lens implant may improve both distance and close-up central vision.""  "
What is the treatment for dry macular degeneration?,"'There is currently no treatment available to reverse dry macular degeneration. However, dry macular degeneration is usually slowly progressive and most patients with this condition are able to live relatively normal, productive lives. Often one eye is affected more than the other.'""Once dry AMD reaches the advanced stage, no form of treatment can prevent further vision loss. However, treatment can delay and possibly prevent intermediate AMD from progressing to the advanced stage of severe vision loss. The National Eye Institute's Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS and AREDS2) found that taking a specific high-dose formulation of antioxidants and zinc significantly reduces the risk of advanced AMD and its associated vision loss. Slowing AMD's progression from the intermediate stage to the advanced stage is helpful in reducing the progression of visual loss in many people.""'In this study, researchers used an antioxidant formulation that included ''vitamin C'', ''vitamin E'', beta-carotene (or ''vitamin A''), and zinc. For people with early-stage dry macular degeneration, there is no evidence that these ''vitamins'' provide a benefit. It is recommended that people with intermediate-stage dry AMD in one or both eyes or advanced stage AMD (dry or wet) in one eye, but not the other eye, take the AREDS formulation. Patients with increased risk of ''lung cancer'' should not take beta-carotene. Studies involving other ''supplements'' such as lutein, zeaxanthin, other carotenoids, black currant, and bilberry are currently under way.''Lifestyle changes can slow the progression of dry age-related macular degeneration. These include changing the diet to include more fruits and vegetable, choosing healthy unsaturated fats, such as olive oil, over unhealthy saturated fats, such as butter, eating whole grains rather than refined grains and adding fish high in ''omega-3 fatty acids''.' "
What are complications of macular degeneration?,"'Progression to wet macular degeneration is the main complication of dry age-related macular degeneration. At any time, dry macular degeneration can progress to the more severe form of the disease called wet macular degeneration, which may cause rapid vision loss. There is no accurate way to predict who will eventually develop wet macular degeneration.''Other eye diseases such as ''cataracts'', ''glaucoma'', ''retinal detachment'', or ''dry eyes'' are not complications of macular degeneration. However, patients with macular degeneration can develop these or other eye diseases and people with these conditions can also develop AMD concurrently.' "
What is the prognosis for macular degeneration?,"'Macular degeneration in its advanced form can cause loss of all central vision in both eyes. In the absence of other eye diseases, peripheral vision is maintained. Therefore, patients with advanced macular degeneration are, in most cases, able to see enough to get around within familiar surroundings.''The use of magnifying devices can often improve vision in macular degeneration to allow for reading or watching of television.' "
Is it possible to prevent macular degeneration?,"'Your lifestyle can play a role in reducing your risk of developing AMD. Eating a healthy diet high in green leafy vegetables and fish, not ''smoking'', maintaining ''blood pressure'' and weight at normal levels, and engaging in regular moderate ''exercise'' can be helpful in ''prevention'' of macular degeneration.' "
What is the latest research on macular degeneration?,"'There is a large amount of research currently being performed to increase our understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms of macular degeneration. These include evaluation of families with a history of AMD to understand genetic and hereditary factors that may cause the disease. There are multiple drugs and devices presently in various phases of clinical trials to both prevent and treat macular degeneration. These include new drugs to prevent new blood vessel formation, certain anti-inflammatory treatments for the wet form of AMD, and drug-delivery systems to reduce the need for frequent injections for the wet form of macular degeneration. Researchers are investigating the possibility of transplantation of healthy cells into a diseased retina.''This research should provide better ways to detect, treat, and prevent vision loss in people with AMD.' "
About BSE,"'BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) is a progressive neurological disorder of cattle that results from infection by an unusual transmissible agent called a prion. The nature of the transmissible agent is not well understood. Currently, the most accepted theory is that the agent is a modified form of a normal protein known as prion protein. For reasons that are not yet understood, the normal prion protein changes into a pathogenic (harmful) form that then damages the central nervous system of cattle.'""Research indicates that the first probable infections of BSE in cows occurred during the 1970's with two cases of BSE being identified in 1986. BSE possibly originated as a result of feeding cattle meat-and-bone meal that contained BSE-infected products from a spontaneously occurring case of BSE or scrapie-infected sheep products. Scrapie is a prion disease of sheep. There is strong evidence and general agreement that the outbreak was then amplified and spread throughout the United Kingdom cattle industry by feeding rendered, prion-infected, bovine meat-and-bone meal to young calves.""'The BSE epizootic in the United Kingdom peaked in January 1993 at almost 1,000 new cases per week. Over the next 17 years, the annual numbers of BSE cases has dropped sharply; 14,562 cases in 1995, 1,443 in 2000, 225 in 2005 and 11 cases in 2010. Cumulatively, through the end of 2010, more than 184,500 cases of BSE had been confirmed in the United Kingdom alone in more than 35,000 herds.''There exists strong epidemiologic and laboratory evidence for a causal association between a new human prion disease called variant ''Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease'' (vCJD) that was first reported from the United Kingdom in 1996 and the BSE outbreak in cattle. The interval between the most likely period for the initial extended exposure of the population to potentially BSE-contaminated food (1984-1986) and the onset of initial variant CJD cases (1994-1996) is consistent with known incubation periods for the human forms of prion disease.''Through February 2015, BSE surveillance has identified 24 cases in North America: 4 BSE cases in the United States and 20 in Canada. Of the 4 cases identified in the United States, one was born in Canada; of the 20 cases identified in Canada, one was imported from the United Kingdom (see figure above).' "
BSE Cases Identified in the United States,"'There have been 4 cases of BSE identified in the United States. The following information provides descriptions of these 4 cases:' On December 23, 2003, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a presumptive diagnosis of the first known case of BSE in the United States. It was in an adult Holstein cow from Washington State. This diagnosis was confirmed by an international reference laboratory in Weybridge, England, on December 25. Trace-back based on an ear-tag identification number and subsequent genetic testing confirmed that the BSE-infected cow was imported into the United States from Canada in August 2001. Because the animal was non-ambulatory (a ""downer cow"") at slaughter, brain tissue samples were taken by USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service as part of its targeted surveillance for BSE. However the animal's condition was attributed to complications from calving. After the animal was examined by a USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) veterinary medical officer both before and after slaughter, the carcass was released for use as food for human consumption. During slaughter, the tissues considered to be at high risk for the transmission of the BSE agent were removed. On December 24, 2003, FSIS recalled beef from cattle slaughtered in the same plant on the same day as the BSE positive cow. On June 24, 2005, the USDA announced receipt of final results from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, England, confirming BSE in a cow that had conflicting test results in 2004. This cow was from Texas, died at approximately 12 years of age, and represented the first endemic case of BSE in the United States. On March 15, 2006, the USDA announced the confirmation of BSE in a cow in Alabama. The case was identified in a non-ambulatory (downer) cow on a farm in Alabama. The animal was euthanized by a local veterinarian and buried on the farm. The age of the cow was estimated by examination of the dentition as 10-years-old. It had no ear tags or distinctive marks; the herd of origin could not be identified despite an intense investigation. In August 2008, several ARS investigators reported that a rare, genetic abnormality that may persist within the cattle population ""is considered to have caused"" BSE in this atypical (H-type) BSE animal from Alabama. On April 24, 2012, the USDA confirmed a BSE case in a dairy cow in California. This cow was tested as part of the USDA targeted BSE surveillance at rendering facilities in the United States. The cow was 10 years and 7 months old and was classified as having the L-type BSE strain."
BSE Cases Identified in Canadian-born Cattle,"'As of February 18, 2015, 20 BSE cases in Canadian-born cattle have been identified, 19 in Canada and 1 in the U.S. Of these 20 cases, 14 were known to have been born after the implementation of the 1997 Canadian feed ban ; 13 of these 14 were born after March 1, 1999. (See Figure above: BSE Cases in North America, by Year and Country of Death, 1993-02/2015). This latter date is particularly relevant to the U.S. because since a USDA rule went into effect on November 19, 2007, Canadian cattle born on or after March 1, 1999 have been legally imported into this country for any use. One of the 20 Canadian-born BSE cases was reported in an animal that was most likely born before or possibly very shortly after implementation of the 1997 feed ban. Based on the known or most likely year of birth, an average of 1.4 cases of BSE occurred among the group of animals born each year in Canada from 1991 through 2004. The highest reported number of cases by birth year in a single year, 3 BSE cases, occurred in 2000, 2001 and 2002. The most recently reported case extends the period of BSE transmission in Canada through at least the early half of 2009.' "
Strains of BSE,"'There is increasing evidence that there are different strains of BSE: the typical BSE strain responsible for the outbreak in the United Kingdom and two atypical strains (H and L strains).''All (3) of the U.S.-born BSE cases and two of the 20 Canadian-born BSE cases were 10 years of age or older and caused by atypical BSE strains. Of these 5 older North American cases, 3 were linked to an atypical BSE strain known as the H-type. The strain type for the other two older North American cases, a 13-year-old BSE-infected Canadian cow and a 10-year-old BSE-infected US cow, have been identified as the L-type.' Typical BSE strain -- The BSE strain responsible for most of the BSE cases in Canada is the same classic or typical strain linked to the outbreak in the United Kingdom. It is known to be preventable through elimination of BSE contaminated feed and has been causally linked to vCJD in humans. This typical strain has not yet been identified in any U.S.-born cattle. Atypical BSE strain -- In July 2007, the UK Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) suggested that atypical BSE may be a distinct strain of prion disease. Unlike typical BSE, cases of atypical BSE, according to SEAC, may have risen spontaneously (although transmission through feed or the environment cannot be ruled out). Recently reported French surveillance data support this theory that unlike typical BSE, atypical BSE appears to represent sporadic disease."
Feed Bans,"'As of October 26, 2009, a regulation issued by FDA in April 2009 came into effect establishing an enhanced BSE-related feed ban in the United States. This enhanced ban will further harmonize BSE feed control measures in the U.S. with those in Canada (see below). In addition, FDA continues to enforce its important 1997 mammalian-to-ruminant feed ban through its BSE inspection and BSE feed testing programs.''As of July 12, 2007, an enhanced BSE-related feed ban came into effect in Canada. CFIA established this ban to more effectively prevent and quickly eliminate BSE from Canada. The enhanced ban prohibits most proteins, including potentially BSE infectious tissues known as ""specified risk materials"" (SRM) from all animal feeds, pet foods, and fertilizers, not just from cattle feed as required by the ban instituted in 1997. The 1997 feed ban in Canada was similar to the feed ban instituted in the United States that same year. As recently reported by CFIA, removing SRM from the entire animal feed system addresses risks associated with the potential contamination of cattle feed during production, distribution, storage, and use. Applying the same measure to pet food and fertilizer materials addresses the possible exposure of cattle and other susceptible animals to these products. CFIA expects that with this new ban, BSE should be eliminated from the Canadian cattle herd by about the year 2017.''The Canadian-born cow confirmed to be infected with BSE in 2015 illustrates the difficulty in determining the effectiveness of previously instituted feed bans to prevent BSE transmissions. The initial feed bans established in both the United States and Canada were instituted in 1997. After an assessment by USDA and its Canadian counterparts, the Canadian feed ban was judged to be fully effectiveness as of March 1999. However, largely because of recognized limitations of this ban and the ban established in the United States, new, enhanced feed bans went into effect in Canada, July 12, 2007, and in the U.S., October 26, 2009. While USDA has confirmed no U.S.-born cattle as having a classic form of BSE, Canadian cattle born after March 1999 have been legally imported into the United States for any purpose since November 19, 2007.' "
BSE Prevalence,"'Based on World Organization of Animal Health (OIE) standards for BSE surveillance, the reported national prevalence rates of BSE in North American cattle, particularly in animals born in the United States, is very low, and therefore, difficult to measure accurately. In September 2007, the USDA published updated results of the two statistical models used by Harvard University investigators to estimate the prevalence of BSE in Canada. The results incorporated the 11 Canadian-born animals with BSE that had been reported at that time. A key advantage of these models is that they provide statistical confidence limits that measure some of the uncertainty associated with expected estimates. This model estimated that the true prevalence of BSE in Canada has been 90% likely to be between 18-fold and 48-fold higher than the previously published best estimate of the prevalence of BSE in the United States (3.0 to 8.0 cases per million in Canada compared to a best estimate of 0.167 cases per million in the United States). The previously published best estimate of Canada\'s BSE prevalence in 2006 using the BSurveE model was 23-fold higher than that of the United States and is the estimate of the BSE prevalence in Canada that continues to be used in the Harvard Risk Assessments\' ""worst case"" analyses when evaluating the risk of imported Canadian cattle causing BSE to spread among U.S. animals.' "
What is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)?,"'An MRI or magnetic resonance imaging is a radiology techinque scan that uses magnetism, radio waves, and a computer to produce images of body structures. The MRI scanner is a tube surrounded by a giant circular magnet. The patient is placed on a moveable bed that is inserted into the magnet. The magnet creates a strong magnetic field that aligns the protons of hydrogen atoms, which are then exposed to a beam of radio waves. This spins the various protons of the body, and they produce a faint signal that is detected by the receiver portion of the MRI scanner. A computer processes the receiver information, which produces an image.''MRI image and resolution is quite detailed, and it can detect tiny changes of structures within the body. For some procedures, contrast agents, such as gadolinium, are used to increase the accuracy of the images.' "
What are the uses for an MRI?,"""An MRI scan can be used as an extremely accurate method of disease detection throughout the body and is most often used after the other testing fails to provide sufficient information to confirm a patient's diagnosis. In the head, ""'trauma'' to the brain can be seen as bleeding or swelling. Other abnormalities often found include brain aneurysms, ''stroke'', tumors of the brain, as well as tumors or inflammation of the spine.''Neurosurgeons use an MRI scan not only in defining brain anatomy, but also in evaluating the integrity of the spinal cord after trauma. It is also used when considering problems associated with the vertebrae or intervertebral discs of the spine. An MRI scan can evaluate the structure of the heart and ''aorta'', where it can detect aneurysms or tears. MRI scans are not the first line of imaging test for these issues or in cases of trauma.''It provides valuable information on glands and organs within the abdomen, and accurate information about the structure of the joints, soft tissues, and bones of the body. Often, surgery can be deferred or more accurately directed after knowing the results of an MRI scan.' "
What are the risks and side effecs of an MRI?,"'An MRI scan is a painless radiology technique that has the advantage of avoiding x-ray radiation exposure. There are no known side effects of an MRI scan. The benefits of an MRI scan relate to its precise accuracy in detecting structural abnormalities of the body.''Patients who have any metallic materials within the body must notify their physician prior to the examination or inform the MRI staff. Metallic chips, materials, surgical clips, or foreign material (artificial joints, metallic bone plates, or prosthetic devices, etc.) can significantly distort the images obtained by the MRI scanner. Patients who have heart pacemakers, metal implants, or metal chips or clips in or around the eyeballs cannot be scanned with an MRI because of the risk that the magnet may move the metal in these areas. Similarly, patients with ''artificial heart'' valves, metallic ear implants, bullet fragments, and ''chemotherapy'' or ''insulin'' pumps should not have MRI scanning.''During the MRI scan, patient lies in a closed area inside the magnetic tube. Some patients can experience a claustrophobic sensation during the procedure. Therefore, patients with any history of ''claustrophobia'' should relate this to the practitioner who is requesting the test, as well as the radiology staff. A mild sedative can be given prior to the MRI scan to help alleviate this feeling. It is customary that the MRI staff will be nearby during MRI scan. Furthermore, there is usually a means of communication with the staff (such as a buzzer held by the patient) which can be used for contact if the patient cannot tolerate the scan.'  "
How do I prepare for an MRI? How is it performed?,"'All metallic objects on the body are removed prior to obtaining an MRI scan. Occasionally, patients will be given a sedative medication to decrease ''anxiety'' and relax the patient during the MRI scan. MRI scanning requires that the patient lie still for best accuracy. Patients lie within a closed environment inside the magnetic machine. Relaxation is important during the procedure and patients are asked to breathe normally. Interaction with the MRI technologist is maintained throughout the test. There are loud, repetitive clicking noises which occur during the test as the scanning proceeds. Occasionally, patients require injections of liquid intravenously to enhance the images which are obtained.The MRI scanning time depends on the exact area of the body studied, but ranges from half an hour to an hour and a half.' "
When do I receive the results of an MRI?,"'After the MRI scanning is completed, the computer generates visual images of the area of the body that was scanned. These images can be transferred to film (hard copy). A radiologist is a doctor who is specially trained to interpret images of the body. The interpretation is transmitted in the form of a report to the practitioner who requested the MRI scan. The doctor can then discuss the results with the patient and/or family.' "
What does an MRI look like (pictures)?,'This patient had a ''herniated disc'' between vertebrae L4 and L5. The resulting surgery was a discectomy' 
What new MRI scanners available?,"'Scientists are developing newer MRI scanners that are smaller, portable devices. These new scanners apparently can be most useful in detecting infections and tumors of the soft tissues of the hands, ''feet'', elbows, and knees. The application of these scanners to medical practice is now being tested.' "
When should you call your doctor after a tick bite?,"'You should talk to your doctor if you live in a place where ''Lyme disease'' is common.''For ''Lyme disease'' to get transmitted to you, a tick needs to be attached to you for at least 36 hours. Other infections can be transferred in a few minutes to a few hours.''Visit your doctor right away if you are not able to separate the tick from your body.''It is fine to feel minor ''pain'', swelling, and redness (that does not grow) near the bitten area for 1 or 2 days. However, you need to call your doctor if you experience any of the following within the next 30 days''The treatment for most tickborne diseases includes a short course of antibiotics.' Fever Chills Racing heart Difficulty breathing Weakness in the limbs Rash Fatigue Severe headache Muscle aches Joint swelling/pain"
How can you avoid tick bites?,"'The only sure way to avoid tick bites is to stay away from places where they are generally known to reside. This means steering away from grassy or wooded areas.''Here are eight tips to stay tick-free''Spray insect repellent on your clothing, boots, and camping gear. Choose products that contain any of these''Stay in the middle of the trail while ''walking''.''Choose an open ground or well-maintained lawn over wooded areas for picnics.''Wear light-colored clothing so that the dark-colored ''ticks'' can be spotted easily.''Tuck your pants inside your socks.''Check your as well as your child’s body thoroughly for ticks.

What is malaria?,"'Malaria'' is an infectious disease caused by parasites that invade ''red blood cells''. The protozoan parasites are among several species of the genus ''Plasmodium'"". This malaria parasite is transmitted by mosquitoes (vectors) to humans through mosquito bites that, during the bite, release parasites into the person's blood. Malaria is characterized by cycles of ""'chills'', high ''fever'', and ''sweating''.'  "
Is malaria contagious?,"'No, malaria is not ''contagious''. Malaria is not spread from person to person and is not sexually transmitted. Malaria is not contagious through casual contact or through kissing. It is not considered a sexual transmitted disease (''STD''). Malaria is transmitted from mosquitoes to humans. There is one strain of the parasite ''Plasmodium'', ''P. knowlesi'', that can be transmitted from monkeys (macaques) by mosquitoes to humans and is termed ""zoonotic"" malaria.' "
What is the incubation period for malaria?,"'The time period from initial parasite infection to the appearance of symptoms varies according to the particular species of ''Plasmodium'' that infects an individual. For example, ''P. malariae'' ranges from about 18-40 days, while ''P. falciparum'' ranges from nine to 14 days, and 12-18 days for ''P. vivax'' and ''P. ovale''. Initial symptoms of malaria may include shaking chills, high fevers, ''sweating'', ''headaches'', ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ''anemia'', and/or ''diarrhea''. Diagnostic tests include microscopic examination of the blood for the presence of parasites, serology, ''PCR'' testing, and other tests that determine if the parasite is resistant to certain ''drugs''.''Travelers returning from malaria-endemic areas should remind health-care providers about their travels for at least one year after they have returned from that area of the world to avoid potentially missing the diagnosis of the disease.' "
How does malaria spread?,"'The majority of malarial infections are spread or transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes that take a blood meal from humans. During this blood meal, ''Plasmodium'"" parasites are regurgitated by the mosquito into the person's blood vessels. The parasites require both mosquitoes and humans to go through a complete and complex lifecycle that involves several life stages for development and maturation of the parasites. Malaria is not transmitted person to person. Although it is an infectious disease, it is not communicable in most instances to uninfected individuals. It is possible to transmit malaria through blood transfusions, to a fetus, or by organ donation. However, control measures have markedly reduced such transmissions."" "
"How long does malaria last, and how long will it take to be cured of malaria?","'Treatment of malaria depends on the number of different factors that include disease severity, the particular species of ''Plasmodium'' infecting the patient and the potential for ''drug resistance'' of the various species and strains of ''Plasmodium''. In general, it takes about two weeks of treatment to be cured of malaria. However, in some individuals, relapses are possible.' "
When should people seek medical care for a suspected malaria infection?,"'If an individual has visited or lived in an area where malaria is endemic (including parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America) and subsequently develops a ''headache'', high ''fever'' that comes and goes, ''fatigue'', body ''aches'', and/or shaking chills (rigors) and ''cough'', he or she should seek immediate medical attention. Patients should tell medical caregivers if they have lived in or traveled to areas where malaria is endemic. This will help the medical caregivers to order appropriate tests to confirm malaria. The most severe problems (''pulmonary edema'', ''kidney failure'', ''brain injury'', death) are seen mainly with ''P. falciparum'' infections.' "
What is malaria?,"'Malaria is a serious, life-threatening, and sometimes fatal, disease spread by mosquitoes and caused by a parasite. Malaria was a significant health risk in the U.S. until it was eliminated by multiple disease-control programs in the late 1940s. The illness presents with ''flu-like symptoms'' that include high ''fever'' and ''chills''.''There are three necessary aspects to the malaria life cycle:' The Anopheles mosquito carries the parasite and is where the parasite starts its life cycle. The parasite (Plasmodium) has multiple subspecies, each causing a different severity of symptoms and responding to different treatments. The parasite first travels to a human's liver to grow and multiply. It then travels in the bloodstream and infects and destroys red blood cells."
Is malaria contagious?,"'Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease and that does not spread from person to person (except in ''pregnancy'' as noted below) but spreads in certain circumstances without a mosquito. This occurs rarely and is usually found in a transmission from a ''pregnant'' woman to an unborn child (congenital malaria), by blood transfusions, or when intravenous-drug users share needles. Except for the above conditions, malaria is not considered ''contagious'' person to person.' "
What is the incubation period for malaria?,"'Following the mosquito bite, there is about a seven- to 30-day period before symptoms appear (incubation period). The incubation period for ''P. vivax'' is usually 10-17 days but can be much longer (about one year and rarely, as long as 30 years!). ''P. falciparum'' usually has a short incubation period (10-14 days). Other species of ''Plasmodium'' that cause malaria have incubation periods similar to ''P. vivax''.' "
What causes malaria? What are the types of malaria?,"'Parasites of the genus ''Plasmodium'' cause malaria. Although there are many species of the malaria parasite ''Plasmodium'', only five infect humans and cause malaria.''Plasmodium falciparum'': found in tropical and subtropical areas; major contributor to deaths from severe malaria''P. vivax'': found in Asia and Latin America; has a dormant stage that can cause relapses''P. ovale'': found in Africa and the Pacific islands''P. malariae'': worldwide; can cause a chronic infection''P. knowlesi'': found throughout Southeast Asia; can rapidly progress from an uncomplicated case to a severe malaria infection'  "
What are malaria symptoms and signs?,"'Malaria has a wide spectrum of symptoms. After the bite by the infected mosquito occurs, it can take between seven and 30 days (average is seven to 15 days) before symptoms start (incubation period).''Health care professionals classify malaria as uncomplicated or complicated (severe).''The most common symptoms are''The classic description of a malaria attack (which is rarely observed), would be a six- to 12-hour period of ''cold'' and shivering alternating with fever and ''headaches'' and then a stage of ''sweating'' and ''tiredness'' (sometimes divided into the cold and hot stage).''As these symptoms are very nonspecific, it is important to evaluate if the patient has risk factors for malaria (usual travel in endemic areas).''This occurs when malaria affects different body systems.'

What specialists treat malaria?,"'Malaria can be treated by your primary care doctor (pediatrician, family medicine, internal medicine), as well as by infectious-disease specialists.' "
How do physicians diagnose malaria?,"'The ''symptoms of malaria'' can mimic many other diseases, including ''influenza'' or a viral syndrome. It is therefore important to inquire about a history of recent travel to an endemic area or other possible exposures.'""Physicians make a definite diagnosis of malaria by looking at the blood of an infected patient under the microscope (blood smear) and identifying the presence of the parasite. The patients' blood is prepared under a slide with a specific stain to help identify the parasite. This is the most widely performed and accepted test.""'Rapid diagnostic tests (antigen tests) are available that can give the diagnosis in a few minutes. It is recommended that a blood smear examination follows a positive test.' "
What is the treatment for malaria?,"'Besides supportive care, the medical team needs to decide on the appropriate antimalarial drug(s) to treat malaria. The choice will depend on several factors, including''Physicians will administer the medication in pill form or as an intravenous antimalarial depending on above factors.''The most commonly used medications are'  the specific species of parasite identified, the severity of symptoms, and determination of drug resistance based on the geographic area where the patient traveled. chloroquine (Aralen), doxycycline (Vibramycin, Oracea, Adoxa, Atridox), quinine (Qualaquin), mefloquine (Lariam), atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone), artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem), and primaquine phosphate (Primaquine)."
Can malaria reoccur after treatment?,"'P. vivax'' and ''P. ovale'' can hibernate in the liver and cause relapsing disease weeks or months after the patient is symptom free.''The FDA approved tafenoquine (Krintafel) as a medication to prevent relapses of ''Plasmodium vivax'' in patients 16 years of age and older. It is a single-dose medication that will provide a significant new tool in fighting ''P. vivax'' malaria relapse, according to researchers.' "
What is the prognosis of malaria?,"'If diagnosed early and if the appropriate antimalarials are available and used, the prognosis of malaria is very good.''Worldwide, malaria is responsible for over 400,000 deaths per year. The majority of victims are young children from sub-Saharan Africa. Death is usually due to lack of available treatment or access to treatment.''P. falciparum'' tends to be the species causing the most complications and has a high mortality if untreated.''Cerebral malaria, a complication of ''P. falciparum'' malaria, has a 20% mortality rate even if treated.' "
Is there a malaria vaccine?,"'There is currently no commercial ''vaccine'' available to prevent malaria. Due to the diversity of the ''Plasmodium'' species and the ''P. falciparum'' species being the deadliest parasite, most efforts are currently directed toward a ''P. falciparum'' vaccine. RTS,S/ASO1 is the most advanced candidate as a viable vaccine.''A phase 3 trial of RTS,S/ASO1 was completed and results published in 2015. The WHO is supporting the pilot implementation in several sub-Saharan countries.' "
How can people prevent malaria?,"'The prevention of malaria includes several steps.''First, evaluate if malaria is a concern in the area of travel (''CDC malaria information by country table''). This table will also indicate which medication to take as ''chemo''-prophylaxis.''If chemo-prophylaxis is recommended, discuss the recommended medications with a health care professional to determine if they are appropriate. Take into consideration any medical conditions, ''drug interactions'' with current medication taken on a continual basis, as well as side effects of the recommended medications.''No medication is 100% effective, and therefore the prevention of mosquito bites is of paramount importance. These preventive measures should include the following:' Sleeping under bed nets: These should cover all of the bed down to the floor. These nets are most effective when treated with an insecticide. Clothing: Clothing that covers most of the exposed skin and shoes that are closed can reduce the risk of bites. Tuck in all clothing, and pants should be tucked into socks to avoid exposure around the ankles. In addition, treating clothes with insecticides can prevent bites even further. Apply insect repellent to all exposed skin."
What is male breast cancer?,"'Men possess a small amount of nonfunctioning breast tissue (breast tissue that cannot produce milk) that is concentrated in the area directly behind the nipple on the chest wall. Like breast cancer in women, cancer of the male breast is the uncontrolled growth of some of the cells of this breast tissue that have the potential to spread elsewhere in the body. These cells become so abnormal in appearance and behavior that they are then called cancer cells.''Breast tissue in healthy young boys and girls consists of tubular structures known as ducts. At ''puberty'"", a girl's ovaries produce female hormones (estrogen) that cause the ducts to grow and milk-producing glands (lobules) to develop at the ends of the ducts. The amount of fat and connective tissue in the breast also increases as girls go through puberty. On the other hand, male hormones (such as testosterone) secreted by the testes suppress the growth of breast tissue and the development of lobules. The male breast, therefore, is made up of predominantly small, undeveloped ducts and a small amount of fat and connective tissue.""  "
How common is male breast cancer?,"'Male breast cancer is a rare medical condition, accounting for only about 1% of all breast cancers. Statistics from the American Cancer Society suggest that yearly, about 2,550 new cases of breast cancer in men are diagnosed and that breast ''cancer causes'"" approximately 480 deaths in men (in comparison, almost 40,000 women die of breast cancer each year). Breast cancer is 100 times more common in women than in men. Most cases of male breast cancer are detected in men between the ages of 60 and 70, although the condition can develop in men of any age. A man's lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is about 1/10 of 1%, or one in 1,000. Breast cancer incidence rates in men have remained fairly stable over the past 30 years."" "
What are causes and risk factors of male breast cancer?,"'As with cancer of the female breast, the cause of cancer of the male breast has not been fully characterized, but both environmental influences and genetic (''inherited'') factors likely play a role in its development. The following health risk factors for the development of male breast cancer have been identified.'""Exposure to ionizing radiation has been associated with an increased risk of developing male breast cancer. Men who have previously undergone radiation therapy to treat malignancies in the chest area (for example, Hodgkin's ""'lymphoma'') have an increased risk for the development of breast cancer.''Men normally produce small amounts of the female hormone estrogen, but certain conditions result in abnormally high levels of estrogen in men. The term ''gynecomastia'' means that the ''male breasts'' are abnormally enlarged in response to elevated levels of estrogen. High levels of ''estrogens'"" also can increase the risk for development of male breast cancer. The majority of breast cancers in men are estrogen receptor-positive (meaning that they have proteins on the surface of the cells that can receive and transport estrogen through the cell wall and into the interior of the cell). Two medical conditions in which men have abnormally high levels of estrogen that are commonly associated with breast enlargement are Klinefelter's syndrome and ""'cirrhosis'' of the ''liver''. ''Obesity'' is also associated with elevated estrogen levels and breast enlargement in men. Certain medications can cause ''gynecomastia'' as a side effect when taken for long periods. These include several types of medicine used to treat ''high blood pressure'', medicines to reduce stomach acid, ''valium'', ''finasteride'', medicines to treat ''prostate cancer'', and others. Check the side effects of the medicines you take if you think you may be developing male breast tissue enlargement (gynecomastia).''Klinefelter\xa0syndrome is an inherited health condition affecting about one in 1,000 men. A normal man has two sex chromosomes (X and Y). He inherited the female X chromosome from his mother and the male Y chromosome from his father. Men with Klinefelter\xa0syndrome have inherited an extra female X chromosome, resulting in an abnormal sex chromosome ''makeup'"" of XXY rather than the normal male XY. Affected Klinefelter's patients produce high levels of estrogen and develop enlarged breasts, sparse facial and body hair, small testes, and the inability to produce sperm. Some studies have shown an increase in the risk of developing breast cancer in men with this condition. Their risk for development of breast cancer is markedly increased, up to 50 times that of normal men.""'Cirrhosis'' can result from chronic ''alcohol abuse'', chronic ''viral hepatitis'', or rare genetic conditions that result in accumulation of toxic substances within the liver. The liver produces important binding proteins that affect the transport and delivery of male and female hormones via the bloodstream. With cirrhosis, ''liver function'' is compromised, and the levels of free and protein-bound male and female hormones in the bloodstream are altered. Men with cirrhosis of the liver have higher blood levels of estrogen and have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Men who are heavy users of ''alcohol'' have an increased risk of breast cancer, possibly related to the effects of alcohol on the liver.''Epidemiologic studies have shown that men who have a family history that includes several female relatives with breast cancer also have an increased risk for development of the disease. In particular, men who have inherited mutations in the breast cancer-associated BRCA2 gene have an increased risk for developing breast cancer, with a lifetime risk of about six in 100 for development of breast cancer. BRCA2 is a gene on chromosome 13 that normally functions in suppression of cell growth. Mutations in this gene lead to an increased risk for development of breast, ovarian, and ''prostate cancers''. A portion of breast cancers in men are thought to be attributable to BRCA2 mutation. Mutations in the BRCA1 gene, which has been associated with inherited breast cancers in women, increase the risk for male breast cancer to a lesser degree than mutations in BRCA2 (lifetime risk of one in 100).''Other genetic mutations have also been associated with an increase in risk for breast cancer in men, including mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene (Cowden’s syndrome), TP53 mutations (Li-Fraumeni syndrome), PALB2 mutations, and mutations associated with hereditary nonpolyposis ''colorectal cancer'' (Lynch syndrome).' "
What are the different types of male breast cancer?,"'The most common type of male breast cancer is infiltrating ductal carcinoma, which is also a common type of breast cancer in women. Ductal carcinoma refers to cancers with origins in the ducts (tubular structures) of the breast, and the term infiltrating means that the cancer cells have spread beyond the ducts into the surrounding tissue. On the other hand, lobular cancers (cancers of the milk glands), common in women, are extremely rare in men since male breast tissue does not normally contain lobules.''Other less common types of cancers of the breast that have been reported in men include ductal ''carcinoma in situ'' (cancerous changes in the ducts that have not spread beyond the ducts themselves), cystosarcoma phylloides (a type of cancer of the connective tissue surrounding the ducts), and '""Paget's disease of the breast""' (a cancer involving the skin of the nipple). Some other types of breast cancer that occur in men are named for their growth patterns and microscopic appearance of the cancer cells, including papillary carcinoma, ''inflammatory breast cancer'' (inflammatory carcinoma), and medullary carcinoma.''About 85% of breast cancers in men have estrogen receptors on their cell membranes. Estrogen receptors on the cell membranes allow estrogen molecules to bind to the cancer cells. Estrogen binding to the cancer cells can stimulate cell growth and multiplication.' "
What are male breast cancer symptoms and signs?,"'The most common clinical sign of breast cancer in men is a firm, usually painless mass located just under the nipple. There may not be other associated symptoms. The average size of breast cancer in men when first discovered is about 2.5 cm in diameter. The cancer may cause skin changes in the area of the nipple. These changes can include''Bloody or opaque discharge from the nipple may also occur. Less than 1% of cases are bilateral (occurring on both sides).''Breast cancer that has spread or metastasized (metastatic breast cancer) to other tissues can cause other symptoms depending upon the tissues or organs affected.'   ulceration of the skin, skin puckering or dimpling, redness, scaling, or itching of the nipple; or retraction (turning inward) of the nipple."
How do health care professionals diagnose male breast cancer?,"'Diagnosis of breast cancer requires identifying cancer cells in tissue specimens obtained by taking a sample of the growth -- also called a ""mass"" or ""tumor"" -- by the technique of biopsy. Since men have little breast tissue, cancers in male breasts are easily palpable (located by feel) and are often found on self-examination. Also, they are therefore easily accessible to biopsy. Fine needle aspiration or needle biopsy of a suspicious mass can usually establish a diagnosis. A doctor inserts a needle into the mass to withdraw tissue from the suspicious area. Microscopic examination of the tissue by a pathologist establishes the diagnosis.''Other techniques that may be used to diagnose breast cancer in men include incisional (removing a portion of the suspicious tissue) or excisional (removing the mass in its entirety) biopsy of a breast mass. If ''nipple discharge'' is present, microscopic examination of a smear of the discharge can sometimes establish the diagnosis.'  "
What is staging of male breast cancer?,"'Doctors carry out staging to determine the extent to which a cancer has spread within the body. Staging of breast cancer in men is carried out identically to the staging of breast cancer in women. Imaging studies such as ''X-rays'', ''CT scans'', ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), ''ultrasound'', and bone scans may be performed to evaluate the presence and extent of metastatic disease once the initial diagnosis of breast cancer had been made. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system takes into account the tumor size, ''lymph node'' involvement by cancer, and presence of ''metastasis''. For 2018, a new edition of the AJCC staging system also takes into account biologic characteristics of the tumor including estrogen receptor (ER) and ''progesterone'' receptor (PR) status, ''tumor grade'' (the appearance of the cells under a microscope and their similarity to normal cells), and the presence of the HER-2 protein on the cancer cells.''Stage 0 refers to ''intraductal carcinoma'' or ductal cancer in situ, in which the cancer cells have not spread beyond the boundaries of the ducts themselves.''In Stage I breast cancer, the tumor is 2 cm or less in greatest diameter and has not spread to the lymph nodes or to other sites in the body.''Stage II cancers are divided into two groups. Stage IIA cancer is either less than 2 cm in diameter with spread to the axillary lymph nodes, or the tumor is between 2 cm-5 cm but has not spread to the axillary lymph nodes. Stage IIB tumors are either larger than 5 cm without spread to the lymph nodes or are between 2 cm-5 cm in size and have spread to the axillary lymph nodes.''Stage III is considered to be locally advanced cancer. Stage IIIA means the tumor is smaller than 5 cm but has spread to the axillary lymph nodes, and the axillary lymph nodes are attached to each other or to other structures; or the tumor is greater than 5 cm in diameter with spread to the axillary lymph nodes, which may be attached to each other or to other structures. Stage IIIB tumors have spread to surrounding tissues such as skin, chest wall, or to the lymph nodes inside the chest wall.''Stage IV cancer refers to metastatic cancer, meaning it has spread to other parts of the body. With breast cancer, metastases (sites of tumor elsewhere in the body) are most often found in the bones, ''lungs'', liver, or brain. It may also reoccur in and spread to involve areas of the chest wall, skin, and muscles, as well as more distant lymph nodes.' T: tumor size and extent of local spread N: extent of tumor involvement of lymph nodes in the axillary (underarm) region. Since the nipple area is rich in lymphatic vessels, male breast cancer commonly spreads via the lymphatic channels to the axillary lymph nodes. (When the tumor has spread to the lymph nodes, doctors sometimes use the term ""lymph node-positive"" cancer.) M: presence of distant metastases (spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic vessels)"
What is the medical treatment options for male breast cancer?,"'Like breast cancer in women, medical treatment depends upon the stage of the cancer and the overall physical condition of the male breast cancer patient. Treatments are the same as for breast cancer in women.''Most men diagnosed with breast cancer are initially treated by surgery. A modified radical ''mastectomy'' (removal of the breast, lining over the chest muscles, and portions of the underarm or axillary lymph nodes) is the most common surgical treatment of male breast cancer. Sometimes doctors also remove portions of the muscles of the chest wall.''After surgery, adjuvant therapies are often prescribed. These are recommended especially if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes (node-positive cancer). Adjuvant therapies include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and ''hormone therapy''. In cases of metastatic cancer, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or a combination of both, are generally recommended.''Chemotherapy'' refers to the use of a variety of different ''drugs'' that can do as little as slow the growth of cancer cells to as much as kill some, or occasionally, all cancer cells in a breast cancer patient. Chemotherapy may be given as pills, as an injection, or via an intravenous infusion, depending upon the types of drugs chosen. Combinations of different drugs are usually given, and treatment is administered in cycles with a recovery period following each treatment. There are numerous drugs uses today to treat breast cancer. The same chemotherapy agents used in women for breast cancer can be effective in men. In most cases, chemotherapy is administered on an outpatient basis. Chemotherapy may be associated with unpleasant side effects including ''fatigue'', ''hair loss'', ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''.''Radiation therapy'' uses high-energy radiation to kill tumor cells. Radiation therapy may be delivered either externally (using a machine to send radiation toward the tumor) or internally (radioactive substances placed in needles or catheters and inserted into the body).''Hormonal therapy'' prevents hormones from stimulating growth of cancer cells and is useful when the cancer cells have binding sites (receptors) for hormones. Over 90% of male breast cancers express estrogen receptors and are most commonly treated with the drug ''tamoxifen'' (''Nolvadex''), which blocks the action of estrogen on the cancer cells. Side effects of tamoxifen treatment can include ''hot flashes'', ''weight gain'', ''mood changes'', and ''impotence''.''While estrogen is the most common target of hormonal therapy, studies have also shown that treatments directed against the actions of male hormones (anti-androgens) can also reduce the size of male breast cancer metastases. The reasons why anti-androgens are effective in widespread disease are not fully understood. Orchiectomy (removal of the testes) was formerly performed to lower ''androgen'' levels, but newer nonsurgical methods are currently favored. Drugs known as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs affect the ''pituitary gland'' and result in lowered production of male hormones by the testes.''Targeted therapy'' involves agents that are designed to specifically target one of the cancer-specific changes in cells. An example of targeted therapy is ''trastuzumab'' (''Herceptin''), a monoclonal antibody that blocks the activity the protein known as HER-2-neu that is made by some breast cancers. This treatment is only used in breast cancers whose cells express the HER-2-neu protein and is given intravenously. Trastuzumab has been shown to be effective in women with breast cancer but has not been extensively tested in men with breast cancer. Similarly, lapatinib (Tykerb) is a drug taken in pill form that also targets the HER2/neu protein. It is used in combination with other agents to treat HER2-positive breast cancer that is no longer responsive to trastuzumab.''If a cancer that has been surgically removed regrows at the original site, this is referred to as local recurrence. Locally recurrent cancers are usually treated by surgery along with chemotherapy or radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy. Clinical trials are another option for some men with breast cancer. Clinical trials in ''oncology'' are designed to test new drugs or combinations of drugs in specific groups of patients.'  "
What health care specialists treat male breast cancer?,"'Male breast cancer is treated by the same health care specialists as breast cancer in women, including surgeons or surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists.' "
What is the outcome (prognosis) of male breast cancer? What is the survival rate for male breast cancer?,"'The prognosis of a male patient with\xa0breast cancer is considered similarly to female breast cancer. As in female breast cancer, the size and extent (stage) of tumor are the most important factors in the prognosis for male breast cancer. Overall survival rates for each tumor stage are similar for men and women. Since men have less breast tissue than women, it is less common for breast cancers in men to be diagnosed at a very early stage and more likely to have spread beyond the breast when they are identified, resulting in a more advanced tumor stage at diagnosis.''Disease-specific five-year survival rates (meaning the percentage of patients who do not die of the disease for at least five years following diagnosis) reported for male breast cancer by stage are as follows:''These survival rates were calculated using historical data, and it is likely that current treatments will lead to even greater survival rates for those recently diagnosed.' Stage 0 - 100% Stage I - 100% Stage II - 91% Stage III - 72% Stage IV - 20%"

Male Menopause Introduction,'Women may not be the only ones who suffer the effects of changing hormones. Some doctors are noticing that their male patients are reporting some of the same symptoms that women experience in ''perimenopause'' and ''menopause''.''The medical community is currently debating whether or not men really do go through a well-defined ''menopause''. Doctors say that male patients receiving ''hormone therapy'' with testosterone have reported relief of some of the symptoms associated with so-called ''male menopause''.' 
What Is Male Menopause?,"'Because men do not go through a well-defined period referred to as ''menopause'', some doctors refer to this problem as ''androgen'' (testosterone) decline in the ''aging'' male, or what some people call ''low testosterone''. Men do experience a decline in the production of the male hormone testosterone with ''aging'', but this also occurs with conditions such as ''diabetes''. Along with the decline in testosterone, some men experience symptoms that include ''fatigue'', ''weakness'', ''depression'', and sexual problems. The relationship of these symptoms to decreased testosterone levels is still controversial.''Unlike menopause in women, when hormone production stops completely, testosterone decline in men is a slower process. The testes, unlike the ovaries, do not run out of the substance it needs to make testosterone. A healthy male may be able to make sperm well into his eighties or longer.''However, as a result of disease, subtle changes in the function of the testes may occur as early as 45 to 50 years of age, and more dramatically after the age of 70 in some men.' "
How Is Male Menopause Diagnosed?,"'To make the diagnosis of male menopause, the doctor will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms. He or she may order other diagnostic tests to rule out any medical problems that may be contributing to the condition. The doctor will then order a series of blood tests, which may include measuring testosterone level.' "
Can Male Menopause Be Treated?,"'If testosterone levels are low, ''testosterone replacement therapy'' may help relieve such symptoms as loss of interest in sex (''decreased libido''), ''depression'', and ''fatigue''. But, as with ''hormone replacement therapy'' in women, ''testosterone replacement therapy'' has potential risks and side effects. Replacing testosterone may worsen ''prostate cancer'', for example.''If you or a loved one is considering androgen replacement therapy, talk to a doctor to learn more. Your doctor may also recommend certain lifestyle changes, such as a new ''diet'' or ''exercise'' program, or other medications, such as an ''antidepressant'', to help with some of the symptoms of male menopause.

What is malignant hyperthermia? ,"'Malignant hyperthermia is a severe reaction to particular drugs that are often used during surgery and other invasive procedures. Specifically, this reaction occurs in response to some anesthetic gases, which are used to block the sensation of ''pain'', and with a muscle relaxant that is used to temporarily paralyze a person during a surgical procedure. If given these drugs, people at risk for malignant hyperthermia may experience muscle rigidity, breakdown of muscle fibers (rhabdomyolysis), a high ''fever'', increased acid levels in the blood and other tissues (acidosis), and a rapid heart rate. Without prompt treatment, the complications of malignant hyperthermia can be life-threatening. ''People at increased risk for this disorder are said to have malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Affected individuals may never know they have the condition unless they undergo testing or have a severe reaction to anesthesia during a surgical procedure. While this condition often occurs in people without other serious medical problems, certain inherited muscle diseases (including  central core disease and multiminicore disease) are associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. ' "
How common is malignant hyperthermia?,"'Malignant hyperthermia occurs in 1 in 5,000 to 50,000 instances in which people are given anesthetic gases. Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia is probably more frequent, because many people with an increased risk of this condition are never exposed to drugs that trigger a reaction. ' "
What genes are related to malignant hyperthermia? ,"'Variations of the ''CACNA1S'' and ''RYR1'' genes increase the risk of developing malignant hyperthermia. ''Researchers have described at least six forms of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, which are caused by mutations in different genes. Mutations in the ''RYR1'' gene are responsible for a form of the condition known as MHS1. These mutations account for most cases of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Another form of the condition, ''MHS5'', results from mutations in the ''CACNA1S'' gene. These mutations are less common, causing less than 1 percent of all cases of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. ''The ''RYR1'' and ''CACNA1S'' genes provide instructions for making proteins that play essential roles in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of certain charged atoms (ions) into muscle cells. The proteins produced from the ''RYR1'' and ''CACNA1S'' genes are involved in the movement of calcium ions within muscle cells. In response to certain signals, the ''CACNA1S'' protein helps activate the RYR1 channel, which releases stored calcium ions within muscle cells. The resulting increase in calcium ion ''concentration'' inside muscle cells stimulates muscle fibers to contract. ''Mutations in the ''RYR1'' or ''CACNA1S'' gene cause the ''RYR1'' channel to open more easily and close more slowly in response to certain drugs. As a result, large amounts of calcium ions are released from storage within muscle cells. An overabundance of available calcium ions causes skeletal muscles to contract abnormally, which leads to muscle rigidity in people with malignant hyperthermia. An increase in calcium ion concentration within muscle cells also activates processes that generate heat (leading to increased body temperature) and produce excess acid (leading to acidosis). ''The genetic causes of several other types of malignant hyperthermia (MHS2, MHS4, and MHS6) are still under study. A form of the condition known as MHS3 has been linked to the ''CACNA2D1'' gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in activating the RYR1 channel to release calcium ions into muscle cells. Although this gene is thought to be related to malignant hyperthermia in a few families, no causative mutations have been identified. ' "
How do people inherit malignant hyperthermia? ,"'Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of a severe reaction to certain drugs used during surgery. In most cases, an affected person inherits the altered gene from a parent who is also at risk for the condition. ' "

What is melanoma?,"'Melanoma is a ''cancer'' that develops in melanocytes, the pigment cells present in the skin. It can be more serious than the other forms of ''skin cancer'' because of a tendency to spread to other parts of the body (metastasize) and cause serious illness and death. About 50,000 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed in the United States every year.''Because most melanomas occur on the skin where they can be seen, patients or their spouses are often the first to detect suspicious tumors. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial. Caught early, most melanomas can be cured with relatively minor surgery.''This article is written from the standpoint of the patient. Instead of describing the disease in exhaustive detail, the article focuses on answering the questions: ""How do I know if I have melanoma?"" and ""Should I be checked for it?""''Guideline # 1'"": Nobody can conclusively diagnose one's self. A physician should examine new spots on the skin that ""'itch'', bleed, or enlarge. It is always better to be safe than sorry so if there is concern about a particular skin lesion see a medical specialist.''Everybody gets spots on their skin. The older we are, the more spots we have. Most of these spots are benign. That means they are neither cancerous nor on the way to becoming cancerous. These may include ''freckles'', benign ''moles'', collections of blood vessels called cherry angiomas, or raised, irregular, pigmented ''bumps on the skin'' called seborrheic keratoses.''Guideline # 2'': The vast majority of moles are benign lesions that do not turn into anything else. Most melanomas do not arise in preexisting moles. For that reason, having all of one\'s moles removed to ""prevent melanoma"" does not make sense.''Some people are born with moles (the medical name is ""''nevus'',"" plural ""''nevi''""). Almost everyone develops them, starting in childhood. On average, white Europeans have about 25 moles, though some have fewer and others many more. Moles may be flat or raised, and they may range in color from tan to light brown to black. Moles may lose their color and end up flesh colored. It is unusual to develop new pigmented moles after age 35.' "
What does melanoma look like? What are melanoma symptoms and signs?,"'Guideline # 3'': A changing spot may be a problem, but not every change means ''cancer''. A mole may appear and then get bigger or become raised but still be only a mole. It is normal for many moles to start flat and dark, become raised and dark, and then later lose much of their color. This process takes many years.''Most public health information about melanoma stresses the so-called ''ABCDE''s:''These guidelines are can be helpful, but the problem is that many pigmented lesions of the skin are not perfectly symmetrical in their shape or color. Many spots, which seem to have one or more of the ABCDEs, are in fact just ordinary benign skin tumors and are not dangerous. Additionally, some melanomas do not fit this description but may still be spotted by a primary care physician or dermatologist. Not all melanomas have color or are raised above the skin surface.'   Asymmetry: One half of the mole is different from the other half. Border irregularity: The spot has borders which are not smooth and regular but uneven or notched. Color: The spot has several colors in an irregular pattern or is a very different color than the rest of one's moles. Diameter: The spot is larger than the size of a pencil eraser (6 mm). Evolving: The mole is changing in size, shape, color, or overall texture. This may also include new bleeding."
What if the skin changes are rapid or dramatic?,"'Guideline # 4'': The more rapid and dramatic the change, the less serious the problem.''When changes such as ''pain'', swelling, or even bleeding come on rapidly, within a day or two, they are likely to be caused by minor ''trauma'"", often a kind one doesn't remember (like scratching the spot while sleeping). If a spot changes rapidly and then goes back to the way it was within a couple of weeks, or falls off altogether, it is not likely to represent anything serious. Nevertheless, this would be a good time to say once again: Nobody can diagnose him- or herself. If one sees a spot that looks as though it is new or changing, show it to a doctor. If one see a spot that doesn't look like one's other spots, it should be evaluated."" "
What are the causes and risk factors for melanoma?,"'Guideline # 5'"": Individual sunburns do raise one's risk of melanoma. However, slow daily sun exposure, even without burning, may also substantially raise someone's risk of ""'skin cancer''.'""Factors that raise one's risk for melanoma include the following:""'The presence of close (first-degree) family with melanoma is a high risk factor, although looking at all cases of melanoma, only 10% of cases run in families.''Having a history of other sun-induced ''skin cancers'"" raises one's risk of melanoma because they are markers of long-term sun exposure. The basic cell type is different, however, and a basal cell or ""'squamous cell carcinoma'' cannot ""turn into melanoma"" or vice versa.'   Caucasian (white) ancestry Fair skin, light hair, and light-colored eyes A history of intense, intermittent sun exposure, especially in childhood (This would include tanning booths.) Many (more than 100) moles Large, irregular, or ""funny looking"" moles Close blood relatives -- parents, siblings, and children -- with melanoma"
How can people estimate their level of risk for melanoma?,"""The best way to know one's risk level is to have a dermatologist perform a full body examination. That way one will find out whether the spots one has are moles and, if so, whether they are abnormal in the medical sense. More darkly pigmented individuals are at less risk skin ""'cancers'' in general and melanoma in particular.''The medical term for such moles is ''atypical'"". This is a somewhat confusing term, because among other things the criteria are not clear, and it's not certain that an atypical mole is necessarily ""'precancerous''. Patients who have lots of ""''atypical moles''"" (more than 24) do have a higher risk for developing melanoma but not necessarily within one of their existing funny-looking moles. It may be a challenge to find the ""baby melanoma"" in the middle of a back full of large, dark, or irregular moles. If someone has such moles, a doctor will recommend regular surveillance and may recommend biopsy of the most unusual or worrisome looking moles.''Sometimes, one learns at a routine skin evaluation that one does not necessarily need annual routine checkups. In other situations, a doctor may recommend regular checks at 6-month or yearly intervals.' "
What are the types of melanoma?,"'The main types of melanoma are as follows:' Superficial spreading melanoma: This type accounts for about 70% of all cases of melanoma. The most common locations are the legs of women and the backs of men, and they occur most commonly between the ages of 30-50. (Note: Melanomas can occur in other locations and at other ages, as well.) These melanomas are flat or barely raised and have a variety of colors. Such melanomas evolve over one to 5 years and can be readily caught at an early stage if they are detected and removed. An ""in situ"" melanoma (malignant melanoma in situ) refers to a very thin superficial spreading melanoma that does not extend deeper than the junction of the dermis and epidermis, the normal location for melanocytes. Nodular melanoma: About 20% of melanomas are thick, blue-black to purplish lumps. They may evolve faster and are more likely to spread. Untreated superficial spreading melanomas may become nodular and invasive. Lentigo maligna: Unlike other forms of melanoma, lentigo maligna tends to occur on places like the face, which are exposed to the sun constantly rather than intermittently. Lentigo maligna looks like a large, irregularly shaped or colored freckle and develops slowly. It may take many years to evolve into a more dangerous melanoma or may never become a more invasive form. Because of the unpredictability of future behavior, removal is recommended. There are also other rarer forms of melanoma that may occur, for example, under the nails (subungual), on the palms and soles (acral lentiginous), uveal or choroidal (ocular), oral or other mucosal areas such as the vulva or penis, or sometimes even inside the body such as the brain."
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose melanoma?,"'Most doctors diagnose melanoma by examining the spot causing concern and performing a minor surgical procedure called a biopsy. A ''skin biopsy'' refers to removing all or part of the skin spot under local anesthesia and sending the specimen to a pathologist for analysis. A small shave or punch biopsy which may be adequate for the diagnosis of other types of skin cancer is not the best for melanoma. To diagnose melanoma, the best biopsy is one that removes the entire extent of the visible tumor. Fine-needle aspiration may have a role in evaluating a swollen ''lymph node'' or a ''liver'' nodule but is not appropriate for the initial diagnosis of a suspicious skin lesion.''It is no longer recommended to do large batteries of screening tests on patients with thin, uncomplicated melanoma excisions, but patients who have had thicker tumors diagnosed or who already have signs and symptoms of metastatic melanoma may need to have ''MRIs'', PET scans, ''CT scans'', chest ''X-rays'', or other X-rays of bones when there is a concern of ''metastasis''.''The biopsy report may show any of the following:''Some doctors are skilled in a clinical technique called epiluminescence microscopy (also called dermatoscopy or dermoscopy). They may use a variety of instruments to evaluate the pigment and blood vessel pattern of a mole without having to remove it. Sometimes the findings support the diagnosis of possible melanoma, and at other times, the findings are reassuring that the spot is nothing to worry about. The standard for a conclusive diagnosis, however, remains a pathologic examination of a skin biopsy.'   A totally benign condition requiring no further treatment, such as a regular mole An atypical mole which, depending on the judgment of the doctor and the pathologist, may need a conservative removal (taking off a little bit of normal skin all around just to make sure that the spot is completely out). A thin melanoma requiring surgery A thicker melanoma requires more extensive surgery or extra tests in which the lymph nodes are examined. Sentinel node biopsy is a procedure in which a dye or radioactive tracer is injected into the tumor site and then draining lymph nodes are identified and removed for microscopic examination. A negative result suggests there has not yet been spread through the lymphatic chain for that area of skin. A positive result suggests there may other lymph nodes involved. Since the removal of draining lymph node basins causes physical problems and does not seem to improve longevity it is no longer generally recommended."
What are melanoma treatment options?,"'In general, early localized melanoma is treated by surgery alone.''An Internet search will name a variety of home remedies and natural products for the treatment of skin cancers, including melanoma. These include the usual topical and systemic antioxidants and naturopathic immune stimulators. There is no scientific data supporting any of these, and their use may lead to unnecessary delay in better established treatments, possibly with tragic results.'   Doctors have learned that surgery does not need to be as extensive as was thought years ago. When treating many early melanomas, for instance, surgeons only remove 1 centimeter (less than ½ inch) of the normal tissue surrounding the melanoma. Deeper and more advanced cancers may need more extensive surgery. Depending on various considerations (tumor thickness, body location, age, etc.), the removal of nearby lymph nodes may be recommended. For advanced disease, when the melanoma spreads to other parts of the body, treatments using immunotherapy or chemotherapy are often recommended. Many of these new treatments have produced rather impressive improvements in longevity ."
How do doctors determine the staging and prognosis (outlook) of a melanoma?,"""The most useful criterion for determining prognosis is tumor thickness. Tumor thickness is measured in fractions of millimeters and is called the Breslow's depth. The thinner the melanoma, the better the prognosis. Any spread to lymph nodes or other body locations dramatically worsens the prognosis. Thin melanomas, those measuring less than 0.75 millimeters when examined microscopically, have excellent cure rates, generally with local surgery alone. For thicker melanomas, the prognosis is guarded.""'Melanoma is staged according to thickness, ulceration, lymph node involvement, and the presence of distant metastasis. The staging of a cancer refers to the extent to which it has spread at the time of diagnosis, and staging is used to determine the appropriate treatment. Stages 1 and 2 are confined to the skin only and are treated with surgical removal with the size of margins of normal skin to be removed determined by the thickness of the melanoma. Stage 3 refers to a melanoma that has spread locally or through the usual lymphatic drainage. Stage 4 refers to distant metastases to other organs, generally by spread through the bloodstream.' "
What is recurrent melanoma?,"'Recurrent melanoma refers to a recurrence of tumor at the site of removal of a previous tumor, such as in, around, or under the surgical ''scar''. It may also refer to the appearance of metastatic melanoma in other body sites such as skin, lymph nodes, brain, or liver after the initial tumor has already been treated. Recurrence is most likely to occur within the first five years, but new tumors felt to be recurrences may show up decades later. Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish recurrences from new primary tumors.' "
What is metastatic melanoma?,"'Metastatic melanoma is melanoma that has spread beyond its original site in the skin to distant tissue sites. There are several types of metastatic melanoma. There may be spread through the lymphatic system to local lymph nodes. This may show up as swollen lymph glands (usually painless) or as a string of skin tumors along a lymphatic chain. Melanoma may also spread through the bloodstream (hematogenous spread), where it may appear in one or more distant sites, such as the ''lungs'', liver, brain, remote skin locations, or any other body location.'  "
What are the signs of symptoms of metastatic melanoma?,"'Signs and symptoms depend upon the site of metastasis and the amount of tumor there. Metastases to the brain may first appear as ''headaches'', unusual numbness in the arms and legs, or ''seizures''. Spread to the liver may be first identified by abnormal blood tests of ''liver function'' long before the patient has ''jaundice'', a swollen liver, or any other signs of liver failure. Spread to the kidneys may cause ''pain'' and ''blood in the urine''. Spread to the lungs may cause ''shortness of breath'', other trouble ''breathing'', ''chest pain'', and continued ''cough''. Spread to bones may cause bone pain or broken bones called pathologic ''fractures''. A very high tumor burden may lead to ''fatigue'', ''weight loss'', ''weakness'' and, in rare cases, the release of so much melanin into the circulation that the patient may develop brown or black urine and have their skin turn a diffuse slate-gray color. The appearance of multiple blue-gray nodules (hard ''bumps'') in the skin of a melanoma patient may indicate widespread melanoma metastases to remote skin sites.' "
What are the treatments for metastatic melanoma?,"""Historically, metastatic and recurrent melanoma have been poorly responsive to chemotherapy. Immunotherapy, in which the body's own immune system is energized to fight the tumor, has been a focus of research for decades. A variety of newer medications target different points in the pathways of melanoma cell growth and spread. While the most appropriate use of these medications is still being defined, the best treatment for melanoma remains complete surgical excision while it is still small, thin, and has not yet had a chance to spread.""'Initial therapies to stimulate the immune system to help contain metastatic melanoma included infusions of ''interferon''-alpha and interleukin-2 (both parts of the immune response to cancer and infection), and a few patients have responded to these therapies. There has, however, been an explosion recently in the approval of a number of targeted therapies that act on specific stages in the cell cycle, especially those of abnormal cells, and affect those growth processes of the tumor cells. ''Drugs'"" that inhibit the kinase enzymes necessary for cell reproduction, include cobimetinib (Cotellic) and trametinib (Mekinist). Others target the signals for cell growth from abnormal BRAF genes and the enzymes they drive. Such medications in this family include dabrafenib (Tafinlar), vemurafenib (Zelboraf), and nivolumab (Opdivo). Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) blocks the tumor's ability to inhibit T cell activity. Ipilimumab (Yervoy) works directly on the T-lymphocyte pathway to activate the immune system. Many of these medications are now being used in combinations to get better therapeutic effects than they would by themselves. All of these medications have significant side effects, including some that are life-threatening, and are indicated only for stage 3 tumors to try to prevent recurrence and spread and stage 4 metastatic tumors that are no longer amenable to surgery."" "
What are the survival rates for metastatic melanoma?,"""Survival rates for melanoma, especially for metastatic melanoma, vary widely according to many factors, including the patient's age, overall health, location of the tumor, particular findings on the examination of the biopsy, and of course the depth and stage of the tumor. Survival statistics are generally based on 5-year survival rates rather than raw cure rates. Much of the success reported for the targeted therapies focuses on disease-free time because in many cases the actual 5-year survival is not affected. It is hoped that combination therapy discussed above will change that."" For stage 1 (thin melanoma, local only), 5-year survival is ≥ 90%. For stage 2 (thicker melanoma, local only), 5-year survival is 80%-90%. For stage 3 (local and nodal metastasis), 5-year survival is around 50%. For stage 4 (distant metastasis), 5-year survival is 10%-25% depending upon sex and other demographic factors."
What methods are available to help prevent melanoma?,"   Reducing sun exposure: Avoidance of ultraviolet light exposure, including exposure in tanning booths, is the best means of helping to prevent melanoma, followed by wearing hats and opaque clothing, and then followed by broad-spectrum waterproof sunscreens applied liberally to exposed skin. The consensus among dermatologists is that sunscreens are helpful and are certainly preferable to unprotected sun exposure. (Despite sensational articles in the popular press, there is no credible evidence that sunscreens can cause melanoma. Data to indicate increased melanoma risk did not take into consideration that the sunscreens used by the subjects [at least as well as they could remember after decades] were far inferior to current products, which usually have much higher ultraviolet B SPF protection as well as ultraviolet A protection.) Early detection: Get one's skin checked at least once. Then, if it is recommended, have one's skin checked on a regular basis. The American Academy of Dermatology sponsors free skin cancer screening clinics every May all over the country. Special ""Pigmented Lesion Clinics"" have also been established in many medical centers to permit close clinical and photographic follow-up of patients at high risk. Screening of high-risk individuals: Anyone at high risk, such as anyone with a close relative who has melanoma, should be screened by a doctor for melanoma."
What research is being done on melanoma?,"'Research in melanoma is headed in three directions: ''prevention'', more precise diagnosis, and better treatment for advanced disease.' Prevention: Public education and more widely available screening clinics can increase public awareness of the need for sun avoidance, sunscreen use, avoidance of tanning booths, and early detection of suspicious spots. More precise diagnosis: Newer experimental techniques, such as the confocal scanning laser microscope, may help doctors make more certain calls on borderline or suspicious spots without having to biopsy. Better treatment for advanced disease: Because conventional chemotherapy has been disappointing with melanoma, researchers have turned their attention to biologic treatments of advanced melanoma to stimulate the body's own immune response against the tumor. These new biologic treatments include immune checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and drugs that target cell growth based on genetic changes in the melanoma. Many of these treatments are still investigational and intended for patients with widespread, recurrent life-threatening disease."

What is testicular cancer?,"'Testicular cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of one or both testicles.''The testicles are 2 egg-shaped glands located inside the scrotum (a sac of loose skin that lies directly below the penis). The testicles are held within the scrotum by the spermatic cord, which also contains the vas deferens and vessels and nerves of the testicles.''The testicles are the male sex glands and produce testosterone and sperm. Germ cells within the testicles produce immature sperm that travel through a network of tubules (tiny tubes) and larger tubes into the epididymis (a long coiled tube next to the testicles) where the sperm mature and are stored.''Almost all testicular cancers start in the germ cells. The two main types of testicular germ cell tumors are seminomas and nonseminomas. These 2 types grow and spread differently and are treated differently. Nonseminomas tend to grow and spread more quickly than seminomas. Seminomas are more sensitive to radiation. A testicular tumor that contains both seminoma and nonseminoma cells is treated as a nonseminoma.''Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men 20 to 35 years old.' "
Health history can affect the risk of testicular cancer.,"""Anything that increases the chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for testicular cancer include:""

Signs and symptoms of testicular cancer include swelling or discomfort in the scrotum.,'These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by testicular cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:' A painless lump or swelling in either testicle. A change in how the testicle feels. A dull ache in the lower abdomen or the groin. A sudden build-up of fluid in the scrotum. Pain or discomfort in a testicle or in the scrotum
Tests that examine the testicles and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose testicular cancer.,"'The following tests and procedures may be used:' Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. The testicles will be examined to check for lumps, swelling, or pain. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. Serum tumor marker test: A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The following tumor markers are used to detect testicular cancer:Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG).Tumor marker levels are measured before inguinal orchiectomy and biopsy, to help diagnose testicular cancer. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG). Inguinal orchiectomy: A procedure to remove the entire testicle through an incision in the groin. A tissue sample from the testicle is then viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells. (The surgeon does not cut through the scrotum into the testicle to remove a sample of tissue for biopsy, because if cancer is present, this procedure could cause it to spread into the scrotum and lymph nodes. It's important to choose a surgeon who has experience with this kind of surgery.) If cancer is found, the cell type (seminoma or nonseminoma) is determined in order to help plan treatment."
"After testicular cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body.","'The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.''The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:''Tumor marker levels are measured again, after inguinal orchiectomy and biopsy, in order to determine the stage of the cancer. This helps to show if all of the cancer has been removed or if more treatment is needed. Tumor marker levels are also measured during follow-up as a way of checking if the cancer has come back.''Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:''When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if testicular cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually testicular cancer cells. The disease is metastatic testicular cancer, not ''lung cancer''.' Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Abdominal lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes in the abdomen are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy. For patients with nonseminoma, removing the lymph nodes may help stop the spread of disease. Cancer cells in the lymph nodes of seminoma patients can be treated with radiation therapy. Serum tumor marker test: A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The following 3 tumor markers are used in staging testicular cancer:Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG).Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
The following stages are used for testicular cancer:,"'In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the tiny tubules where the sperm cells begin to develop. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. All tumor marker levels are normal. Stage 0 is also called testicular intraepithelial neoplasia and testicular intratubular germ cell neoplasia.''In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IS and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.''Stage II is divided into stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage IIC and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.''Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.''or''Cancer:''Tumor marker levels may range from normal to high.' In stage IA, cancer is in the testicle and epididymis and may have spread to the inner layer of the membrane surrounding the testicle. All tumor marker levels are normal. In stage IB, cancer:is in the testicle and the epididymis and has spread to the blood vessels or lymph vessels in the testicle; orhas spread to the outer layer of the membrane surrounding the testicle; oris in the spermatic cord or the scrotum and may be in the blood vessels or lymph vessels of the testicle. is in the testicle and the epididymis and has spread to the blood vessels or lymph vessels in the testicle; or has spread to the outer layer of the membrane surrounding the testicle; or is in the spermatic cord or the scrotum and may be in the blood vessels or lymph vessels of the testicle.

What is recurrent testicular cancer?,"'Recurrent testicular cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back many years after the initial cancer, in the other testicle or in other parts of the body.' "
There are different types of treatment for patients with testicular cancer.,"'Different types of treatments are available for patients with testicular cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Testicular tumors are divided into 3 groups, based on how well the tumors are expected to respond to treatment.''For nonseminoma, all of the following must be true:''For seminoma, all of the following must be true:''For nonseminoma, all of the following must be true:''For seminoma, all of the following must be true:''For nonseminoma, at least one of the following must be true:''There is no poor prognosis grouping for seminoma testicular tumors.'   The tumor is found only in the testicle or in the retroperitoneum (area outside or behind the abdominal wall); and The tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and The levels of all the tumor markers are slightly above normal. The tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and The level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is normal. Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be at any level. The tumor is found in one testicle only or in the retroperitoneum (area outside or behind the abdominal wall); and The tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and The level of any one of the tumor markers is more than slightly above normal. The tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; and The level of AFP is normal. β-hCG and LDH may be at any level. The tumor is in the center of the chest between the lungs; or The tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; or The level of any one of the tumor markers is high."
Five types of standard treatment are used:,"'Surgery to remove the testicle (inguinal orchiectomy) and some of the lymph nodes may be done at diagnosis and staging. Tumors that have spread to other places in the body may be partly or entirely removed by surgery.''Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.''Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat testicular cancer.''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses ''drugs'' to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.'""Surveillance is closely following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. It is used to find early signs that the cancer has recurred (come back). In surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests on a regular schedule.""'High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. ''Stem cells'"" (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells."" External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer."
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.,"'For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.''Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.' "
Follow-up tests may be needed.,"'Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.''Men who have had testicular cancer have an increased risk of developing cancer in the other testicle. A patient is advised to regularly check the other testicle and report any unusual symptoms to a doctor right away.''Long-term clinical exams are very important. The patient will probably have check-ups frequently during the first year after surgery and less often after that.' "
Treatment Options by Stage,"'Treatment of stage 0 may include the following:''Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.''Treatment of stage I testicular cancer depends on whether the cancer is a seminoma or a nonseminoma.''Treatment of seminoma may include the following:''Treatment of nonseminoma may include the following:''Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.''Treatment of stage II testicular cancer depends on whether the cancer is a seminoma or a nonseminoma.''Treatment of seminoma may include the following:''Treatment of nonseminoma may include the following:''Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.''Treatment of stage III testicular cancer depends on whether the cancer is a seminoma or a nonseminoma.''Treatment of seminoma may include the following:''Treatment of nonseminoma may include the following:''Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.' Radiation therapy. Surveillance. Surgery to remove the testicle. Surgery to remove the testicle, followed by surveillance.

Combination chemotherapy before surgery to remove the testicle, for cancer that has spread and is thought to be life-threatening. Surgery to remove the testicle, followed by combination chemotherapy. If there are tumors remaining after chemotherapy, treatment may be one of the following:Surveillance with no treatment unless tumors grow.Surveillance for tumors smaller than 3 centimeters and surgery to remove tumors larger than 3 centimeters.A PET scan two months after chemotherapy and surgery to remove tumors that show up with cancer on the scan. Surveillance with no treatment unless tumors grow. Surveillance for tumors smaller than 3 centimeters and surgery to remove tumors larger than 3 centimeters. A PET scan two months after chemotherapy and surgery to remove tumors that show up with cancer on the scan. A clinical trial of chemotherapy. Surgery to remove the testicle, followed by combination chemotherapy. Combination chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove the testicle and all remaining tumors. Additional chemotherapy may be given if the tumor tissue removed contains cancer cells that are growing or if follow-up tests show that cancer is progressing. Combination chemotherapy before surgery to remove the testicle, for cancer that has spread and is thought to be life-threatening. A clinical trial of chemotherapy."
Treatment Options for Recurrent Testicular Cancer,'Treatment of recurrent testicular cancer may include the following:''Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.' Combination chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. Surgery to remove cancer that has either:come back more than 2 years after complete remission; orcome back in only one place and does not respond to chemotherapy. come back more than 2 years after complete remission; or come back in only one place and does not respond to chemotherapy. A clinical trial of a new therapy.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.,"'The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:''Testicular cancer can usually be cured in patients who receive ''adjuvant chemotherapy'' or radiation therapy after their primary treatment.''Certain treatments for testicular cancer can cause infertility that may be permanent. Patients who may wish to have children should consider sperm banking before having treatment. Sperm banking is the process of freezing sperm and storing it for later use.' Stage of the cancer (whether it is in or near the testicle or has spread to other places in the body, and blood levels of AFP, β-hCG, and LDH). Type of cancer. Size of the tumor. Number and size of retroperitoneal lymph nodes."
What is a mammogram?,"'A mammogram is an X-ray test that produces an image of breast tissue on film. This technique, called mammography, is used to visualize normal and abnormal structures within the breasts. Mammography, therefore, can help in identifying ''cysts'', calcifications, and tumors within the breast. It is currently the most efficient screening method to detect early ''breast cancer''. Physical examinations typically find breast ''cancers'' when they are much larger than those detected by mammography.''Mammography can be used to discover a small ''cancer'"" in a curable stage; however, it is not foolproof. Depending a woman's age and other factors, approximately ten to fifteen percent of breast cancers are not identified by mammography, and these cancers are often found by physical examination. It is important for a woman to perform monthly BSE and have a breast examination by her doctor in addition to the mammogram in order to most effectively screen for ""'breast cancer''.''The American Cancer Society recommends that a woman obtain her first baseline mammogram at the age of 40. After that, she should receive a yearly mammogram. Women who are at high risk for developing breast cancer may need to obtain mammograms earlier than these recommendations and at more frequent intervals. Medicare, Medicaid, and most private insurance companies generally cover the cost of mammography.'  "
Does a mammogram hurt?,"'During a mammogram the breasts are placed on a firm flat panel and a gentle, but firm pressure is applied to the breast with another panel, resulting in compression of the breast between the two panels. This can lead to some temporary discomfort that lasts only for a few seconds.' "
"When should I get my first mammogram, and what are the breast cancer 
screening guidelines?","'Various organizations have differing recommendations regarding the timing and frequency of mammography. ' The American Cancer Society recommends that a woman obtain her first baseline mammogram at the age of 45 and receive yearly mammograms through age 54, followed by mammograms every 2 years for women 55 and older. 
	 The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends mammograms every other year starting at age 50 and extending through age 74. 
	 Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the 
	American College of Radiology recommend yearly mammograms starting at age 40. Women who are at high risk for developing breast cancer may need to obtain mammograms earlier than these recommendations and at more frequent intervals."
What are the risks of mammography?,"'Because X-ray procedures use ''radiation'', there is some small risk of radiation side effects to the body. The amount of radiation that is administered in mammography is exceptionally low and is approved by national and international regulatory agencies as well as the National Department of Health and Human Services. In fact, the average radiation exposure from a mammogram is less than what one would receive as a passenger on a transcontinental jet flight. However, patients who are ''pregnant'' or may be pregnant are advised to notify their requesting practitioner and radiology staff, because radiation can pose a risk to the developing fetus.' "
What if I have breast implants?,"'You should inform the mammography facility that you have ''breast implants'' at the time you make your appointment. Breast implants can also make the traditional images obtained in mammography more difficult to interpret, and mammography should be performed by a center with experience in performing mammography on patients with breast implants for best results.' "
How do I prepare for a mammogram?,"'A mammogram does not require special preparation. Women who are still having menstrual periods may find it more comfortable not to schedule a mammogram in the week prior to the expected period when breasts may be tender.''Antiperspirants, deodorants, and powders should not be worn during mammography and should be removed prior to the procedure, as these substances can make interpretation of the results more difficult. Antiperspirants can cause the images to appear foggy, and powders can sometimes simulate the appearance of microcalcifications (an abnormal finding that is sometimes associated with breast cancer).' "
How is a mammogram performed?,"'A brief medical history and a history of specific problems related to the breast, such as ''pain'"" or a palpable lump (one that is felt), is obtained prior to the mammogram. A small X-ray marker may be taped on the breast overlying the palpable lump. This will help in determining whether any other special mammogram views need to be done beyond the standard views. All jewelry and clothing in the chest and breast area are removed prior to the mammogram. The patient's breasts are then placed on a firm flat panel and a gentle, but firm pressure is applied to the breast with another panel, resulting in compression of the breast between the two panels. This compression causes a degree of discomfort that lasts only for a few seconds. The compression of the breast is necessary to obtain quality mammograms and spreads the breast tissue out so that the X-ray image displays the inner breast tissue with good resolution. If compression is not used, the mammograms may be blurry, breast tissue may not be well delineated, and small lesions can be overlooked.""'Antiperspirants, deodorants, and powders should not be worn during mammography and should be removed prior to the procedure, as these substances may make interpretation of the results more difficult. Antiperspirants can cause the images to appear foggy, and powders can sometimes simulate the appearance of microcalcifications (an abnormal finding that is sometimes associated with breast cancer).''Generally, two X-rays are obtained of each breast. More views may be obtained if the breasts are large, the woman has had a ''breast augmentation'', or there is an area on the initial mammography views that needs to be further examined. Special magnified or localized mammograms of a specific area of the breast can then be done.''A radiology technologist is responsible for performing mammography. Once the X-ray pictures are taken, they are developed and examined by a radiologist (a doctor who specializes in the interpretation of X-rays and other imaging studies). In most mammography centers, these radiologists have also had extra training dedicated to interpreting mammograms.' "
How will I receive the results of my mammogram??,"""The results of the mammogram can be given to the patient either by the radiologist at the completion of the mammogram or by the patient's doctor who ordered the mammogram. In many cases, it will be by both doctors. In some cases, the patient will receive a card in the mail with the results of the mammogram. The report of the mammogram generally takes a few days to reach the referring doctor. However, when there is a suspicious area on the mammogram or if additional images are needed, this information is usually relayed directly to the referring doctor or patient by phone so that further evaluation of this area can be done expeditiously. A patient should call the doctor if she has not received the results of a mammogram in a reasonable period of time. The patient should not just assume the mammogram was normal."" "
What if my mammogram is abnormal?,"'Do not panic if you are told that your mammogram is abnormal or that there is a ""spot"" on your mammogram. An abnormal mammogram does ''not ''mean you have cancer. The overwhelming majority of abnormal mammograms are caused by benign (harmless) processes. In some cases, it may just be an area of thicker or denser breast tissue, a ''cyst'', or a benign lump such as a fibroadenoma. When a mammogram detects a suspicious area, the patient may be advised to obtain further mammograms of that area, to have an ultrasound or other imaging study of the breast, to see a specialist in diseases of the breast (this is usually a general surgeon), or to have a biopsy performed of the suspicious area.''A ''breast biopsy'' is the removal of a piece of breast tissue for examination under a microscope. The biopsy can be performed surgically, in which an incision is made and the area removed, or it can be done as a stereotactic core biopsy. Stereotactic core biopsy is a technique of removing samples of the suspicious area without the need of traditional surgery. In this technique, the doctor, with the aid of a special mammography machine and a computer, can identify precisely the abnormality in the breast and then obtain very thin core samples of breast tissue with a special needle. This biopsy test is done with only a local anesthetic in the area of the needle puncture and is generally painless.''Fortunately, most breast biopsies give benign results. While mammography alone is not sufficiently accurate to diagnose or exclude breast cancer, it is currently the best method available to screen for breast cancer. Since its more widespread routine use, breast cancers are found when they are significantly smaller and more curable. More women are surviving breast cancer as a result of mammography and ''early cancer treatment''. Continued use of routine mammography should be encouraged until a better alternative in breast cancer detection has been found.' "

True gynecomastia results from growth of the glandular, or breast tissue, which is present in very small amounts in men. The condition is the most common reason for medical evaluation of the male breast.'  "
Who gets gynecomastia?,"'Normally developing pubertal males may be at risk for gynecomastia that is part of the normal developmental process. Normal male infants also may have gynecomastia.''Other risk factors include:' Aging, since aging may promote decreases in testosterone production that can cause the problem. The risks for developing enlarged male breasts related to specific diseases and conditions (such as cirrhosis of the liver) are the same risk factors that predispose to those conditions. Taking certain medications may increase the risk of developing the problem."
What are the signs and symptoms of gynecomastia?,"'The primary symptom of gynecomastia is enlargement of the male breasts. As mentioned before, gynecomastia is the enlargement of glandular tissue rather than fatty tissue. It is typically symmetrical in location with regard to the ''nipple'' and may have a rubbery or firm feel. Gynecomastia usually occurs on both sides but can be unilateral in some cases. The enlargement may be greater on one side even if both sides are involved. Tenderness and sensitivity may be present, although there is typically no severe ''pain''.''The most important distinction with gynecomastia is differentiation from ''male breast cancer'', which accounts for about 1% of overall cases of ''breast cancer''. Usually, ''cancer'' is confined to one side, is not necessarily centered around the ''nipple'', feels hard or firm, and can be associated with dimpling of the skin, retraction of the nipple, ''nipple discharge'', and enlargement of the underarm (axillary) ''lymph nodes''.'  "
What causes gynecomastia during puberty? How long does it last?,"'Gynecomastia results from an imbalance in hormone levels in which levels of estrogen (female hormones) are increased relative to levels of androgens (male hormones). Gynecomastia that occurs in normally growing infant and pubertal boys that resolves on its own with time is known as physiologic gynecomastia.''All individuals, whether male or female, possess both female hormones (''estrogens'') and male hormones (androgens). During puberty, levels of these hormones may fluctuate and rise at different levels, resulting in a temporary state in which estrogen concentration is relatively high. Studies regarding the prevalence of gynecomastia in normal adolescents have yielded widely varying results, with prevalence estimates as low as 4% and as high as 69% of adolescent boys. These differences probably result from variations in what is perceived to be normal and the different ages of boys examined in the studies.''Gynecomastia caused by transient changes in hormone levels with growth usually disappears on its own within six months to two years. Occasionally, gynecomastia that develops in puberty and persists beyond two years is referred to as ''persistent pubertal gynecomastia''.' "
What diseases and conditions cause gynecomastia?,"'A number of medical conditions may also result in gynecomastia:' Malnutrition and re-feeding (recovery from malnutrition) have both been shown to create a hormonal environment that may lead to gynecomastia. Similarly, cirrhosis of the liver alters normal hormone metabolism and may lead to gynecomastia. Disorders of the male sex organs (testes) can result in decreased testosterone production and relatively high estrogen levels, leading to gynecomastia. These disorders may be genetic, such as Klinefelter's syndrome or acquired due to trauma, infection, reduced blood flow, or aging. Testicular cancers may also secrete hormones that cause gynecomastia. Other conditions that are associated with an altered hormonal environment in the body and may be associated with gynecomastia are chronic renal failure and hyperthyroidism. Rarely, cancers other than testicular tumors may produce hormones that can cause gynecomastia."
What medications cause gynecomastia?,"'Gynecomastia can be a side effect of many medications, for example:''It is appropriate to consult a doctor or other healthcare professional if you think you may be developing or have the condition.' spironolactone (Aldactone), a diuretic that has anti-androgenic activity Calcium channel blockers used to treat hypertension (such as nifedipine [Procardia and others]) ACE inhibitor drugs for hypertension (captopril [Capoten], enalapril [Vasotec]) Some antibiotics (for example, isoniazid, ketoconazole [Nizoral, Extina, Xolegel, Kuric], and metronidazole [Flagyl]) Anti-ulcer drugs (such as ranitidine [Zantac], cimetidine [Tagamet], and omeprazole [Prilosec]) Anti-androgen or estrogen therapies for prostate cancer methyldopa (Aldomet) Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV disease, which may cause fat redistribution leading to pseudogynecomastia or, in some cases, true gynecomastia digitoxin diazepam (Valium) Drugs of abuse (for example, alcohol, marijuana, heroin) Lavender oil and tea tree oil, when used in skin-care products, have been associated with gynecomastia"
How do I know if I have gynecomastia (diagnosis)?,"'The definition of gynecomastia is the presence of breast tissue greater than 0.5 cm in diameter in a male. As previously discussed, gynecomastia is the presence of true breast (glandular) tissue, generally located around the nipple. Fat deposition is not considered true gynecomastia.''In most cases, gynecomastia can be diagnosed by a physical examination. A careful medical history is also important, including medication and ''drug use''. If there is a suspicion of ''cancer'', a ''mammogram'' may be ordered by a health care practitioner. Further tests may be recommended to help establish the cause of gynecomastia in certain cases. These can include blood tests to examine liver, kidney, and thyroid function. Measurement of hormone levels in the bloodstream may also be recommended in some cases.' "
How long does it take for gynecomastia to go away?,"'Although pubertal gynecomastia typically regresses on its own, in rare cases it may persist, requiring treatment. Rarely, it may persist, which requires treatment. Gynecomastia that has been present over 12 months or more (long term) may undergo scarring (fibrosis), which makes treatment with medications much more difficult, if not impossible to achieve a response.''Psychological consequences can occur if the breast enlargement is pronounced or is a source of embarrassment.' "
What drugs are used for the treatment of gynecomastia?,"'Gynecomastia, especially in pubertal males, often goes away on its own within about six months, so observation is preferred over specific treatment in many cases. Stopping medications and treatment of existing medical problems or health conditions that cause enlarged breasts in men also are mainstays of treatment.'   Medical treatments are available to treat gynecomastia, but data on their effectiveness are limited. No drugs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of gynecomastia; however, medications that have been used to treat the condition include: Testosterone replacement has been effective in older men with low levels of testosterone, but it is not effective for men who have normal levels of the male hormone. Clomiphene can be used to treat gynecomastia. It can be taken for up to 6 months. The selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen (Nolvadex) has been shown to reduce breast volume in gynecomastia, but it was not able to entirely eliminate all of the breast tissue. This type of therapy often is most used for severe or painful gynecomastia. Danazol is a synthetic derivative of testosterone that decreases estrogen synthesis by the testes. It works by inhibition of pituitary secretion of LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), substances that direct the sex organs to produce hormones. It is less commonly used to treat gynecomastia than other medications."
What about surgery for the treatment of gynecomastia? Can it be cured?,"'Medications are more effective in reducing gynecomastia in the early stages, since scarring often occurs after about 12 months. After the tissue has become scarred, medications are not likely to be effective, and surgical removal is the only possible treatment.''Reduction mammoplasty (''breast reduction'' surgery) has been used in severe cases of the condition, long-term gynecomastia, or in cases in which drug therapies have not been effective to help restore a normal breast appearance.''Typically, gynecomastia is not associated with long-term problems.' "
Are gynecomastia and male breast cancer related?,"'Men with gynecomastia have about a five-fold greater risk for developing male ''breast cancer'' when compared with the general population. It is believed that the gynecomastia itself is not a ''precancerous'' condition, but rather that the hormonal changes (relative increase in estrogens, lower levels of androgens) that produce gynecomastia in adult men also increase their risk of developing ''breast cancer''.' "
Can gynecomastia be prevented?,'Gynecomastia that occurs because of hormonal fluctuations with growth or ''aging'' cannot be prevented. Gynecomastia related to medical conditions can only be prevented to the extent that the underlying or responsible condition can be prevented.' 
What is mania and what is hypomania?," Mania is a severe episode of elevated/euphoric or irritable mood and increased energy that usually lasts at least a week and severely interferes with the sufferer's ability to function. Hypomania is a less severe version of mania, in that it is characterized by somewhat elevated or irritable mood that may more mildly interfere with a person's functioning to a less debilitating degree than mania."
What are causes and risk factors for mania and hypomania?,"'As with most other mental health issues, mania or hypomania are not directly passed from one generation to another genetically. Rather, each is the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental vulnerabilities. People with these symptoms or with ''schizophrenia'' and ''schizoaffective disorder'' often have risk factors in common, including a family history of any of these disorders, loss of a parent or other ''trauma'', as well as being born prematurely.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of mania and hypomania?,"""Manic symptoms must last at least a week's time, unless it is part of a mixed (more rapidly alternating) mood episode, and include""'Hypomanic'' symptoms must last at least four days in a row and include''While mania and hypomania have many symptoms in common, mania results in more severe problems compared to hypomania.'  euphoric, elevated, expansive, or irritable mood with increased energy; racing thoughts; pressured speech (rapid, excessive, frenzied speaking); decreased need for sleep; grandiose ideas (for example, false/delusional beliefs of paranoia, superiority, or failure); tangential speech (repeatedly changing conversational topics to ones that are hardly related); restlessness/increased goal-directed activity; and impulsivity, poor judgment, or engaging in risky activity (like spending sprees, promiscuity, or excess desire for sex). euphoric, elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and increased energy; excessive self-esteem or grandiosity; less need to sleep; more talkative than usual or feeling pressured to continue talking; expresses ideas rapidly -- quickly changes topics or feels that thoughts are racing; trouble focusing; restlessness or increased participation in goal-oriented activities; and excessively engaging in activities that have a high likelihood of having negative consequences (for example, promiscuity, excessive spending, poor business decisions)."
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose mania and hypomania?,"""There is no one test that definitively assesses that someone has mania or hypomania. Therefore, health care clinicians diagnose either of these mood episodes by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental health information to exclude the presence of other mental conditions. The health care professional will also either perform a physical examination or request that the person's primary care doctor perform one. The medical examination will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and to explore whether or not the individual has past or present other mental health symptoms like ""'depression'', ''anxiety'', or psychotic features (for example, ''delusions'' or ''hallucinations'') that are associated with a medical condition or exposure to a drug of abuse or other substance.'""To determine if an individual has mania, mental health professionals will explore if the sufferer has at least three of the aforementioned symptoms that last most of every day for at least a week and result in either hospitalization or other severe problems with the person's functioning at home, work, school, or in the community. To diagnose a person with hypomania, a practitioner will determine if the sufferer has the symptoms described for at least four days in a row and results in a clear change in the person's functioning. However, symptoms of hypomania cannot rise to the level of severity of causing severe impairment in the person's functioning, or else it is better explained as a manic episode."" "
What are medications and other treatments for mania and hypomania?,"'People with manic or hypomanic feelings can expect their mental health professionals to consider several medical interventions in the form of medications, psychotherapies, and lifestyle advice to address symptoms -- relieving already existing symptoms and preventing symptoms from returning. Mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications are thought to be particularly effective in treating mania or hypomania, in that these groups of medications can be useful in treating active (acute) symptoms of manic or mixed episodes, as well as preventing the return of such symptoms. Despite its stigmatized history, ''electroconvulsive therapy'' (''ECT'') can be a viable treatment for people whose mania is severe and has inadequately responded to psychotherapies and a number of drug trials.'  "
What is the prognosis of mania and hypomania?,"'The prognosis for mania or hypomania is such that individuals tend to have episodes of some sort of mood problem up to 60% of the time. However, the episodes can often be well managed by the combination of psychotherapy and medication treatment. There are a number of potential complications of these mood problems, particularly if left untreated.''Complications of mania or hypomania can include substance use disorders, thinking (cognitive) problems, and generally more medical problems. The risk of committing ''suicide'' is 60 times higher for people who have had mania or hypomania compared to the general population.' "
Is it possible to prevent mania and hypomania?,"'While far more seems to be known about the prevention of symptoms of mania or hypomania once symptoms have occurred at least once, there is emerging research that when family focused therapy is provided to children who have more subtle symptoms prior to having a manic episode and who have relatives who have suffered from a similar mood episode, they may be less likely to develop full-blown ''bipolar disorder'' as adults.' "
What is esophageal manometry?,'Esophageal manometry is a procedure for determining how the muscles of the ''esophagus'' and the sphincter (valve) works by measuring pressures (manometry) generated by the esophageal muscles and the sphincter.' 
When is esophageal manometry used?,'Esophageal manometry is used primarily in three situations:'   To evaluate the function of the sphincter and muscles of the esophagus when there is reflux (regurgitation) of stomach acid and contents back into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD)  To determine the cause of problems with swallowing food (dysphagia) when an endoscopy is normal When there is chest pain that may be coming from the esophagus after the heart as a cause of chest pain has been ruled out
How is esophageal manometry performed?,"'At the start of the esophageal manometry procedure, one nostril is anesthetized with a numbing lubricant.  A flexible ''plastic'' tube approximately one-eighth inch in diameter is then passed through the anesthetized nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus as the patient swallows.  Once inside the esophagus, the tube allows the pressures generated by the esophageal muscle to be measured when the muscle is at rest and during swallows. The procedure usually takes 15 to 20 minutes.' "
How is esophageal manometry used to assist in the diagnosis of diseases and conditions?,"'The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the throat with the stomach.  When food is propelled by a swallow from the mouth into the esophagus, a wave of muscular contraction starts behind the food in the upper esophagus and travels down the entire length of the esophagus (referred to as the body of the esophagus), thus propelling the food in front of the wave through the esophagus and into the stomach.  At the upper and lower ends of the esophagus are two short areas of specialized muscle called the upper and lower esophageal sphincters. At rest (that is, when there has been no swallow) the muscle of the sphincters is active and generates pressure that prevents anything from passing through them.  As a result, material within the esophagus cannot back up into the throat, and stomach acid and contents cannot back up into the esophagus. When a swallow occurs, both the sphincters relax for a few seconds to allow food to pass through the esophagus into the stomach.''The most common use for esophageal manometry is to evaluate the lower esophageal sphincter and the muscle of the body of the esophagus in patients who have ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'').  Manometry often can identify ''weakness'' in the lower esophageal sphincter that allows stomach acid and contents to back up into the esophagus. It also may identify abnormalities in the functioning of the muscle of the esophageal body that may add to the problem of reflux.''Manometry can help diagnose several esophageal conditions that result in food sticking after it is swallowed.  For example, ''achalasia'' is a condition in which the muscle of the lower esophageal sphincter does not relax completely with each swallow.  As a result, food is trapped within the esophagus.  Abnormal function of the muscle of the body of the esophagus also may result in food sticking.  For instance, there may be failure to develop the wave of muscular contraction (as can occur in patients with ''scleroderma'') or the entire esophageal muscle may contract at one time (as in an esophageal spasm). Manometry reveals an absence of the wave in the first case and the contraction of the muscle everywhere in the esophagus at the same time, or spasm, in the second case.''The abnormal functioning of the esophageal muscle also may cause episodes of severe chest ''pain'' that can mimic heart ''pain'' (''angina'').  Such pain may occur if the esophageal muscle goes into spasm or contracts too strongly. In either case, esophageal manometry may identify the muscular abnormality.' "
What limitations are there to the use of esophageal manometry?,"""There are several situations in which esophageal manometry may not demonstrate the esophageal abnormality that is responsible for a patient's problem. For example, many patients with GERD have transient (coming and going infrequently), but prolonged relaxation (minutes rather than seconds) of the lower sphincter, as the cause of their reflux. Such relaxations may be missed in the short period during which the manometric study is being conducted. Similarly, if a patient is having infrequent episodes of chest pain due to esophageal spasm, for example, every few days or weeks, the spasm may not be seen during a short manometric study. There have been attempts to get around these problems by using portable equipment and prolonged manometry for two or more days."" "
What are the side-effects of esophageal manometry?,"'Although esophageal manometry is uncomfortable, the procedure is minimally painful because the nostril through which the tube is inserted is anesthetized.  Once the tube is in place, patients talk and breathe normally.  The side-effects of esophageal manometry are minor and include mild ''sore throat'', ''nosebleeds'"", and, uncommonly, sinus problems due to irritation and blockage of the ducts leading from the sinuses and into the nose.  Occasionally, during insertion, the tube may enter the larynx (voice box) and cause choking.  When this happens, the problem usually is recognized immediately, and the tube is rapidly removed.  Care must be used in passing the tube in patients who are unable to easily swallow on command because without a swallow to relax the upper esophageal sphincter the tube often doesn't enter the esophagus but instead may enter the larynx.""  "
Are there alternatives to esophageal manometry?,"'There are no good alternatives to esophageal manometry. Esophageal manometry is usually performed after anatomic abnormalities have been ruled out by endoscopy. The function of the muscles of the esophagus and the working of the esophageal sphincter may be assessed initially by performing a ''barium swallow''. However, a normal barium swallow will not rule out any abnormal function of the muscles of the esophagus. or the esophageal sphincter. Hence, there is truly no alternative for the esophageal manometry test.' "
What is mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)?,"'Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a relatively rare type of ''cancer'' of the lymphoid cells; it is termed mantle cell lymphoma because the ''cancer'' cells (lymphoma cells) arise from the outer rim or mantle of lymphoid cells that surround a lymphoid follicle. MCL is an aggressive B-cell type of '""non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"""", and the rare disease accounts for about 2%-10% of non-Hodgkin's ""'lymphomas''.' "
What causes mantle cell lymphoma?,"'About 85% of patients with MCL have a characteristic genetic lesion known as a reciprocal translocation, in which short segments of one chromosome are moved to another chromosome. The characteristic change in MCL involves chromosomes 11 and 14 and is called t(11;14). The exchange of chromosomal material occurs at the location of the cyclin D1 gene (BCL-1, now referred to as CCND1) on chromosome 11; the change causes an overproduction of cyclin D1, a protein that stimulates ''tumor'' cell division and growth. This genetic change is considered a driver in the behavior of MCL, which likely works together with other genetic defects to cause MCL. In a small number of patients, t(11;14) is not present. In most of these patients without the characteristic translocation, other genetic changes cause excess production of cyclin D1.' "
What are risk factors for mantle cell lymphoma?,"'There is a lack of agreement in the medical literature on specific risk factors for MCL, although family history and certain genetic changes have been identified that increase the risk. MCL affects males about four times as commonly as females. Blacks and Asians are less likely than whites to develop MCL. Age is a risk factor; the median age of MCL onset is 60 years of age with an age range of 35-85 years.' "
What are signs and symptoms of mantle cell lymphoma?,'Signs and symptoms of MCL may include the following:' Fever Night sweats Generalized enlargement of lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) Fatigue Abdominal distention from an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) Abdominal decision from enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) Weight loss (in about 40% of patients) Spread of the cancer into other organs (extranodal spread) may produce organ-specific symptoms.
"What types of health care professionals diagnose and treat mantle cell 
lymphoma?","""Specialists in cancer treatment (oncologists, hematologists, surgeons, and radiologists), in conjunction with one's primary care physician, treat mantle cell lymphoma."" "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose mantle cell lymphoma?,"'Health care professionals diagnose MCL with needle aspirates of lymph nodes and determine staging by needle aspirates or biopsies of bone marrow. CT, blood tests, and immunotyping (examining the specific molecules expressed on the surface of the lymphoma cells) of cancer cells may be done to further delineate spread and other characteristics of your MCL. Testing for overexpression of the cyclin D1 protein and for the presence of the t(11,14) genetic abnormality are also performed.' "
What are the stages of mantle cell lymphoma?,"'There are four stages of mantle cell lymphoma. Stage I and stage II describe localized MCL. Many patients are seen by physicians in stage III (intermediate-grade or stage) in which the MCL cancer cells have begun to proliferate outside of the nodes, and 70% percent of patients are first diagnosed in stage IV (advanced-stage) in which the cancer cells have gone into masses, often replacing lymph nodes and have spread into other body organs.' "
What is the treatment for mantle cell lymphoma?,"'Treatment of mantle cell lymphoma is difficult because patients usually receive their diagnosis in stage IV, where the MCL has advanced throughout the body. There are many different therapeutic regimens (single-agent and combined ''drugs'') to treat MCL; most include multiple chemotherapy drug administrations (for example, high-dose Ara-C and others). ''Rituximab'' (''Rituxan''), in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, typically treats patients who have MCL. Rituxan is a monoclonal antibody used to treat different ''cancers'' of the lymphoid cells. Newer chemotherapy drugs used for MCL include bortezomib (''Velcade''). Other treatments include autologous stem cell transplantation and R-hyper-CVAD (rituximab hyper CVAD), a more intensive form of chemotherapy (drug intensified ''chemo''-immunotherapy) and R-DHAP chemotherapy for refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. Some patients may benefit from surgical debulking (removal of tissue to reduce symptoms). There is no cure for MCL; health care providers administer treatments to reduce symptoms and/or to increase limited survival time.''Patients should speak with their physician team members to decide what treatment options are best, as there are new specialized drug treatments and protocols continually appearing in the medical literature. For example, ibrutinib (Imbruvica) is a new formulation (one pill per day) that patients who have obtained at least one prior therapy can use.'  "
What are complications of mantle cell lymphoma?,"'Besides the signs and symptoms caused by mantle cell lymphoma, the major complications of MCL are decreased lifespan and death. Other complications come from treatments, mainly chemotherapy treatment, and include the following:' Infection Anemia Neutropenia (a reduced number of infection fighting cells) Thrombocytopenia (reduced platelet count) Fatigue Neuropathy Nausea Vomiting Dehydration Damage to the heart from certain chemotherapy drugs"
What is the prognosis of mantle cell lymphoma?,"'MCL has a poor prognosis, even with appropriate therapy. Usually, physicians note treatment failures in less than 18 months, and the median survival time of individuals with MCL is about two to five years. The 10-year survival rate is only about 5%-10%. However, some researchers claim to have doubled the median survival rate in younger patients (less than 65 years of age) treated with an intensive regimen of chemotherapy in clinical trials.'  "
Is it possible to prevent mantle cell lymphoma?,"'Currently, there is no known way to prevent the genetic changes that drive MCL.' "
Are there clinical trials for mantle cell lymphoma?,"'Yes, there clinical trials for mantle cell lymphoma. For example, an open-label phase 2 trial of several drugs, alone and in combination in treatment for refractory mantle cell lymphoma found evidence that a triple combination of drugs warrants evaluation. For further information and a list of those trials and their locations, please visit ''https://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/listings/condition/628/mantle-cell-lymphoma''.' "
What is Marburg virus disease?,"'In 1967, laboratory workers, all in the same lab in Marburg, Germany, were hospitalized with an unknown disease. The laboratory workers were exhibiting the same symptoms, including fever, ''diarrhea'', ''vomiting'', massive bleeding from many different organs, ''shock'', and collapse of the circulatory system. In this outbreak, 31 people were infected, and seven died. The source of the infection was traced to a virus infecting African green monkeys that were imported from Uganda, Africa, and were being used for ''polio'' vaccine research. This new virus was eventually designated as a new virus family termed ''Filoviridae''. The other members of the family are ''Ebola'' viruses (five different species). ''Filoviridae'' contain one negative-sense RNA strand and have a covering or envelope composed of a ''lipid'' membrane. The disease Marburg virus causes is termed Marburg virus disease.''The most recent outbreaks of Marburg virus disease have occurred in Uganda. In 2012, 15 individuals were diagnosed and four people died (27% fatality rate). Again, the Ugandan Ministry of Health reported on Oct. 5, 2014, that a health-care worker died of Marburg virus disease (formerly known as Marburg hemorrhagic fever [Marburg HF]) on Sept. 30, 2014. The source of his exposure is not clear. This is of interest since Marburg virus is a close relative of the ''Ebola virus'', and both produce clinical signs and symptoms that are often indistinguishable. Health officials said that about 80 people who were in contact with the man who died have been identified and are being were observed for 21 days for signs and symptoms of the disease. No one else contracted the disease.' "
What causes Marburg disease?,"'Marburg and Ebola viruses are considered to be zoonotic infections (transmitted to humans from life cycles in other animals). Although it is unclear as to which animals contain both Marburg and Ebola, it is thought that both may be transmitted to humans from monkeys and/or bats (African fruit bat and ''Rousettus'"" bat). There is no evidence for any insect vectors. Although it is unclear how humans contract these viruses from other animals (perhaps by eating them or by contamination of animal body fluids), it is clear that human-to-human transfer occurs by direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids (for example, saliva, tears, excretions, vomitus, and blood). The Marburg viruses are not thought to be spread by air droplets."" "
What are the symptoms and signs of Marburg infection? What is the incubation period for a Marburg virus infection?,"'The symptoms of Marburg virus infection usually come on suddenly after an incubation period of about five to 10 days. Early symptoms are as follows:''About five days after the symptoms first occur, other symptoms may occur as follows:''Symptoms continue and can become severe; they include the following:''The case fatality rate (''death rate'') ranges from about 23%-90% of infected individuals. Many of the symptoms are similar to those of other infectious diseases such as Ebola, ''malaria'', ''typhoid fever'', and others; so diagnostic tests are useful to rule out other causes of the symptoms. People exposed to Marburg virus usually show signs of infection no later than about 14 days after exposure, but because the clinical symptoms resemble ''Ebola virus'' disease, most people are placed in isolation for 21 days.'  Fever Chills Headache Muscle aches A rash occurs on the chest, back, and stomach in some individuals. Nausea Vomiting Chest pain Sore throat Abdominal pain Diarrhea may appear. Jaundice Pancreatic inflammation Severe weight loss Delirium Liver failure Massive hemorrhaging with organ dysfunction"
What are risk factors for getting Marburg infections?,"'People at risk are those who come in contact with African monkeys (bush meat means meat from monkeys) and bats; individuals who do research on these viruses are also at higher risk of becoming infected. There have been several outbreaks in Africa in miners due to their exposure to bats. Veterinarians may also be at higher risk if they are exposed to African monkeys. Also, people who care for Marburg virus-infected patients and/or health workers who remove those bodies of deceased Marburg virus-infected patients are at high risk of contracting the disease.' "
How do health-care professionals diagnose Marburg viral infections?,"'The diagnosis is usually not made from clinical findings; however, during outbreaks, clinical findings should trigger health-care professionals to isolate patients who may have symptoms of Marburg virus infection. There are laboratory tests including ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR'') and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (''ELISA'') that can detect the Marburg virus later in the course of the disease. These help distinguish Marburg viruses from others that cause Ebola and ''Lassa fever''.' "
What treatment is available for Marburg virus infections?,"'Like Ebola and many other viral diseases, there is no specific treatment for Marburg virus disease. Patients are given supportive hospital care by maintaining their fluid and electrolyte balance and other considerations, such as replacing lost blood and maintaining a good oxygen supply. This supportive care is most effectively done in an intensive-care hospital unit. There are no home remedies to treat Marburg virus infections.' "
What specialists treat Marburg infections?,"'Most individuals with Marburg virus infections are treated in hospitals in the intensive-care units. Specialists who treat the patient are critical-care specialists, hematologists, infectious-disease specialists, hospitalists, and lung specialists.' "
Is it possible to prevent Marburg virus infections?,"'There is no antiviral drug or vaccine approved for use in humans against Marburg viruses. Preventive measures are based on barrier techniques (isolation techniques) that isolate the infected patient from other humans. Those health-care professionals who treat Marburg virus-infected patients must use barrier protections such as gowns, gloves, masks, and shoe coverings; most experts say the best barrier is a hazmat suit and a well-informed person who knows how to decontaminate a hazmat suit.' "
"What is the prognosis for a Marburg virus infection? What complications may 
occur with Marburg infections?",'The prognosis for Marburg infection ranges from fair to poor. The fatality rate varies from about 23%-90%. Individuals cared for in an intensive-care unit have a better chance of survival. Complications that can occur with Marburg infection include the following:' Retinitis (inflammation of the retinas of the eyes) Orchitis (inflammation of the testes) Hepatitis (liver inflammation) Uveitis (inflammation within he pigmented layer of the eye) Transverse myelitis (inflammation of a segment of the spinal cord) Encephalitis (brain inflammation)
What research is ongoing about Marburg virus infections?,"'Research about these viruses is ongoing. Sarepta Therapeutics has been developing the RNA-interfering drug termed AVI-7288. This drug is targeted against the nucleocapsid protein of the virus, and the company has reported infection protection in monkeys ranging from 83%-100% when given four days after the monkeys were infected with Ebola. This drug is undergoing a phase 1 safety trial that began in May 2014. Another company, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals from British Columbia, has a lipid nanoparticle that interferes with the RNA replication of this virus. It too has shown protection against Marburg virus infection in monkeys. This drug is termed TKM-Marburg (also termed NP-718m-LNP).' "
"Why is Africa now seeing so many cases of what were relatively rare viral 
diseases like Ebola and Marburg virus infections?","'There are several main reasons that researchers postulate for an increase:''Africa has undergone the worst outbreak of hemorrhagic fever caused by Ebola virus that it has ever seen (2014-2015, with about 28,610 suspected and/or confirmed infections and 11,380 deaths). For the first time, patients had become infected outside of Africa. It is disconcerting that yet another hemorrhagic fever caused by Marburg virus may enter this potentially lethal arena.' Destruction of habitats of monkeys and bats bring humans into close contact with those animals that harbor these viruses in the wild. Poor economies have left many African people destitute so that some of them hunt, kill, and eat wild animals like monkeys (bush meat). Even in countries with poor economies, a few major cities have hospitals and those individuals who are sick are brought in from isolated villages and, if not diagnosed and isolated, spread the disease inadvertently to other humans."

Bones, ligaments, tendons, and cartilage. Organs, eyes, heart and blood vessels, nervous system, and lungs. Skin."
What are the signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome?,"'The symptoms of Marfan syndrome vary from person to person because connective tissue is found throughout the body. Some people have mild or just a few symptoms, while others can have more serious problems. Symptoms may include:'   Abdominal pain. Arms, legs, fingers, and toes that are much longer in relation to the rest of the body. The chest that caves in or stick out. Curved spine. Flat feet. Headaches. A heartbeat that feels like it is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast. A highly arched mouth that can lead to crowding of teeth. Loose joints. Long, narrow face. Low back pain and numbness in the legs. Shortness of breath due to changes in the lungs or heart. Stretch marks on the skin. Vision changes, such as blurry vision and extreme nearsightedness."
What causes Marfan syndrome?,"'A mutation or change in a gene causes Marfan syndrome. Most people inherit the changed gene from their parents, but some children are born with the syndrome, even though there is no family history of the disorder. This is caused by a new change in the gene.'  "
Are there tests to diagnose Marfan syndrome?,"'No single test can diagnose Marfan syndrome. To see if you have the disorder, your doctor may:' Ask about your family and medical history. Perform a physical exam. Order blood and imaging tests. Order genetic testing to look for the changed gene that causes Marfan syndrome."
"How is Marfan syndrome treated, and can it be cured?","'Although there is no cure for Marfan syndrome, doctors use treatments to relieve symptoms and prevent additional problems or complications. Treatment depends on the area of the body affected by the syndrome and may include:'   Medications to help manage pain and problems with your heart. Other treatments, such as braces. Surgery to help correct problems with your bones or eyes."
What types of doctors or other health care professionals treat Marfan syndrome?,"'Health care providers who may treat Marfan syndrome include:' Cardiologists, who treat issues with the heart. Cardiothoracic surgeons, who specialize in surgery of the heart, lungs, and other organs and tissues in the chest. Clinical geneticists, who diagnose and treat children and adults with genetic disorders. Dental providers, such as orthodontists and oral-maxillofacial surgeons. Dermatologists, who specialize in conditions of the skin, hair, and nails. Mental health professionals, who provide counseling and treat mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Nurse educators, who help you understand your condition and help start treatment plans. Occupational therapists, who teach how to safely perform activities of daily living. Ophthalmologists, who treat eye disorders. Orthopaedists, who treat bone problems. Pediatricians, who diagnose and treat children. Physical therapists, who teach ways to build muscle strength. Primary care doctors, such as family physicians or internal medicine specialists, who coordinate care between the different health providers and treat other problems as they arise. Pulmonologists, who treat lung problems."
Living with Marfan syndrome,"'Treating and living with Marfan syndrome, and its complications is a lifelong process. However, treatment makes it possible for people with the disorder to have long, productive lives. The following tips can help you manage the disorder:''Women with Marfan syndrome can have healthy ''pregnancies''. However, the ''pregnancy'' is high risk because it can add ''stress'' on the heart. If you are thinking about ''getting pregnant'', talk to your doctor. Planning helps doctors treat problems prior to the pregnancy to keep both the mother and baby healthy.' Ask your doctors how often you should schedule follow-up visits. The visits may include regular eye exams, image tests to check for heart and lung problems, and an evaluation of your skeleton and growth. Reach out for support. Talk to your family and friends about the disorder and your feelings. Consider joining a community or online support group. Seek counseling or talk to a health care professional if you feel depressed or anxious about Marfan syndrome and its effects on your body. Eat a healthy well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Consider wearing medical identification to notify providers about your condition during an emergency. If you smoke, quit. Smoking can have a negative impact on both bone and lung health."

"What is marijuana, and how is it abused?","'Marijuana is a plant whose scientific name is ''Cannabis sativa''. Its leaves, seeds, stems, and/or roots are consumed by marijuana users for the purpose of feeling intoxicated (""high""). Although the plant contains hundreds of compounds, the one that has major intoxicating effects is called tetrahydrocannibinol (THC). Although medical marijuana is legal in a few states of the United States, it is one of many illegal drugs in most jurisdictions. Specifically, laws in most states deem it illegal to engage in possession of marijuana, either for the purpose of your own use or for the purpose of distributing it to others. ''Marijuana is the most commonly abused illegal substance worldwide. While the number of people who use marijuana at any one time does not seem to have increased in the past decade, the number of people who have a marijuana-related disorder has increased significantly. This seems to be particularly true for elderly individuals as well as for young Hispanic and African-American adults. In ''teens'', boys remain more likely than girls to smoke or otherwise use marijuana. Native-American adolescents seem to be the ethnic group most vulnerable to engage in recent marijuana use, and Asian adolescents tend to be the least likely. '  "
What is medical marijuana? How is medical marijuana prescribed?,"'Medical marijuana, also called marinol (Dronabinol), is a synthetic form of marijuana. It comes in 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg capsules and is used for the treatment of poor appetite and food intake (''anorexia'') with ''weight loss'' in people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (''AIDS'') and for the ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' due to ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy'' in individuals who have not responded adequately to usual treatments for those symptoms. When used for appetite stimulation, marinol is usually dosed at 2.5 mg once or twice per day before lunch, dinner, and/or bedtime. When it is being prescribed to quell nausea, it is usually prescribed at 5 mg, one to three hours before a chemotherapy treatment and every two to four hours after chemotherapy, up to six doses per day.''The most common physical side effects of marinol include asthenia (''lack of energy''), stomach upset, nausea, ''vomiting'', racing ''heart'' rate, facial flushing, and ''dizziness''.''The most common psychological side effects of marinol include ''anxiety'', sleepiness, ''confusion'', ''hallucinations'', and ''paranoia''.''This medication should, therefore, be used with caution in persons who have a ''mental health'' diagnosis, particularly ''depression'', ''mood swings'', ''schizophrenia'', or ''substance abuse''. When prescribed for those people, the individual is usually under the care of a psychiatrist.' "
What are other names for marijuana?,"'There are many, many ways of referring to marijuana. The technical term for marijuana is cannabis. Some terms like pot, hemp, herb, reefer, ganja, and weed refer to the substance itself. A higher potency form of marijuana is often called hashish or hash. Other words like joints, blunts, backwoods, buds, or bongs refer to the way that marijuana is smoked. Marijuana is also often smoked in pipes or baked in food, like brownies. ' "
What is the history and different types of marijuana?,"'The history of marijuana goes back for thousands of years. It was only made illegal in many countries during the 20th century. In the past 20 years in the United States, the legalization pros and cons of medical marijuana have been intensely debated as it has become legal to use it in 20 states and the District of Columbia. In those jurisdictions, people for whom medical marijuana has been specifically recommended by a physician must carry a (medical) marijuana card that indicates their use of the substance for a clear medical purpose. Individuals who do not carry such a card risk prosecution for marijuana possession. Different states that allow for legal use of marijuana have different guidelines for the legality of possessing and using medical marijuana. For example, at least one bans home cultivation, and there are regulations concerning the operations of dispensaries in some states. ''Federal laws continue to deem marijuana possession, as well as its distribution, as illegal, whether it is used for medicinal purposes or not. While the prosecution rates of individuals who carry small amounts of the substance along with a medical marijuana card tend to be low, dispensaries in states that have legalized medical marijuana remain criminalized and are therefore often raided by law-enforcement agencies. ''Attempts to completely legalize the use of marijuana, whether for medicinal purposes or not, remain strongly contested in most jurisdictions. For example, in 2010, Proposition 19, a measure that would have completely legalized possession and growing marijuana then taxed and regulated its use was defeated in the state of California. However, California already reduced legal sanctions for possessing small amounts of marijuana to the level comparable to the penalty for speeding on a freeway. '""There are a variety of marijuana types, also called strains. Strains tend to be based on leaf color as indicated in pictures, as well as the strains' potency and medical purpose. Medical strains of marijuana are specifically grown for a particular health benefit, like ""'pain management'' or reduction of nausea. Some states place restrictions on the strains of marijuana that may be legally used and sold. Marijuana dispensaries often sell hydroponic marijuana seeds through mail order, which can be grown in nutrient solution, with or without soil. ' "
Is marijuana addictive?,"'Numerous research studies show that marijuana is indeed an addictive substance. The rate of addiction to marijuana has increased for all age groups. Teens are using the drug at younger ages. About one out of every six adolescents who use marijuana develop addiction to it, and half the people who receive treatment for marijuana use are under the age of 25. While the frequency of use seems to have remained the same over the past several years, adults are becoming dependent on marijuana more often. Theories about potential reasons for that increase include increased access to marijuana that is of higher potency, as well as a lower age at which many individuals first use this drug. ''The symptoms of addiction to marijuana are similar to those of any other addictive substance. As with any other drug, in order to qualify for the diagnosis of marijuana addiction, the individual must suffer from a negative pattern of use of this drug, which results in significant problems or suffering, with at least three of the following symptoms occurring at the same time in the same one year period: ''The symptoms of marijuana withdrawal are similar to those of other drugs, especially tobacco. Those symptoms usually start one to two days after last using marijuana and include irritability, anger, ''depression'', ''insomnia'"", drug craving, and decreased appetite. These symptoms tend to interfere with the individual's attempts to stop using marijuana and can motivate the use of both marijuana and other drugs for relief. The symptoms of withdrawal tend to peak within four to six days and last from one to three weeks. "" Tolerance (decreased effects of marijuana over time or needing to increase the amount used to achieve the desired effect)  Withdrawal (characteristic symptoms that occur when the individual abstains from using marijuana for some days)  Often taking marijuana in larger amounts or over a longer period of time than planned Persistent desire to use marijuana or trouble decreasing or controlling its use Spending significant time either obtaining marijuana (for example, buying, growing), using it, or recovering from its effects Significant social, educational, occupational, or leisure activities are either abandoned or significantly decreased as a result of marijuana's use Marijuana use continues despite being aware of or experiencing persistent or repeated physical or psychological problems as a result of its use "
What are abusing marijuana effects on brain?,"'The bad effects of marijuana are numerous. For example, it can impair thinking, as in learning, and memory for several days after each time it is used. That risk seems to be even higher for people who score lower on IQ tests compared to those who score higher.''The social effects of ''smoking'' marijuana can be quite detrimental as well. Adolescents who use the substance are at higher risk of ''pregnancy'', dropping out of school, delinquency, legal problems, and achieving less educationally and occupationally. Individuals who become dependent on marijuana tend to be less motivated, less happy, or satisfied with their life. They are also at risk for ''depression'' and for using larger amounts of ''alcohol'' and other drugs.' "
What are abusing marijuana effects on body?,"'In terms of how long marijuana tends to stay in your system, it can be detected on drug tests for about two weeks. Like many other chemicals that are ingested, marijuana can affect your body in many ways. It seems to be associated with an increased occurrence of certain ''cancers''. It may also increase the risk of sexual dysfunction; statistics indicate that men who smoke or otherwise consume marijuana regularly are at higher risk of either having ''premature ejaculation'' or trouble reaching ''orgasm''. Men and women who use this substance on a regular basis seem to have more sexual partners and to be more at risk for contracting ''sexually transmitted diseases'' compared to those who do not use marijuana.'""Marijuana's effects on the body and brain of a developing fetus seem to be clearly negative. Exposure to this substance before birth (prenatally) is associated with negative effects on fetal growth and body weight, as well as on the impulse control, focusing ability, learning, memory, and decision making in the child who was exposed to marijuana before birth. These negative effects by no means only affect ""'babies'' who are exposed to marijuana before birth (in utero). Marijuana tends to negatively affect learning, judgment, and muscle skills in people who use marijuana by their own volition.' "
What are the treatments for marijuana abuse and addiction?,"'Most individuals with marijuana abuse or dependence are treated on an outpatient basis. Admission to outpatient and inpatient treatment programs for marijuana addiction has increased over the years to the point that the addiction to this substance is nearly as high as dependence on other illegal drugs, like ''cocaine'' or ''heroin''.''Behavioral treatments, like motivational enhancement therapy (MET), cognitive-behavioral therapy (''CBT''), and contingency management (CM), as well as family-based treatments have been found to be effective treatments for marijuana abuse and addiction.''In addition to the individual therapies just described, adolescents who abuse or are addicted to marijuana are often treated using one or more family therapies. These include multidimensional therapy, multisystemic therapy, family support network intervention, and brief strategic family therapy. Each of these interventions uses techniques that are designed to enhance the skills of the addicted individual and his or her family members as a way of discouraging marijuana use.''Although there is no medication that has yet been shown to be a clearly effective treatment of marijuana-use disorders, research shows that ''antidepressant'' medications like ''nefazodone'' (''Serzone'') and ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac'') may help some individuals manage marijuana withdrawal and to avoid relapse, respectively. Oral THC (Dronabinol) may also help alleviate symptoms of marijuana withdrawal. Successful psychotherapeutic approaches to the treatment of marijuana abuse or addiction include motivational approaches to coping skills development.' MET is designed to lessen the resistance a person who abuses marijuana may have to abstain from using it. This intervention is also designed to motivate the individual to change. CBT teaches people who abuse marijuana skills to help them stop using the drug and to ways to avoid or manage other problems that might prevent them from marijuana use recovery. CM usually provides marijuana users with vouchers of increasing value as a reward for repeatedly testing negative for (the absence of) drugs over time. Those vouchers are then exchanged for positive items or services that promote the person's participation in more positive (pro-social) activities, like securing employment or advancing their education or health."
Can marijuana abuse and addiction be prevented?,"'In order to prevent marijuana use, abuse, and addiction, an understanding of the risk factors for those issues is essential. In teens, availability of marijuana in their environment, as well as a tendency to engage in negative behaviors (deviancy) increase the likelihood of marijuana use. For some adolescents, using legal substances like alcohol and tobacco can be gateway drugs for marijuana use, in that the use of those substances increases the likelihood that the teen will use marijuana. ' "
What is the prognosis of marijuana abuse and addiction?,"'While many people with a marijuana-use disorder successfully stop using it with outpatient ''psychotherapy'' that provides motivation and teaches coping skills, the relapse rate is quite high. However, when treatment is provided frequently, that statistic improves. Individuals who begin ''smoking'' marijuana before 17 years of age seem to be more than three times more likely to attempt ''suicide'' than those who either never use the substance or do so after the age of 17. That risk goes the other way as well, in that people who develop depression or have thoughts of ''suicide'' before the age of 17 seem to be at a much higher risk of developing an addiction to marijuana. People who are vulnerable to developing psychosis (for example, having hallucinations like seeing things or ''hearing'"" voices that aren't there; or ""'delusions'', like unfounded beliefs that others are trying to harm him or her) may be more likely to do so if marijuana is used, even on a medicinal basis. Marijuana abuse or addiction is also associated with a much higher risk of developing a dependence on other drugs.' "

What is bone marrow?,"'The soft spongy tissue in the center of bones is the bone marrow. The bone marrow contains the different types of cells (''stem cells'') that give rise to the ''red cells'', white blood cells, and platelets found in our blood. The marrow may also contain abnormal cells, proteins, or inflammatory reactions that are not normally present, such as ''cancer'' cells (for example, Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin ''lymphoma'' cells or ''leukemia'' cells) in some individuals. Since the production of red cells requires iron, the marrow is one of the places in the body that normally stores a supply of iron. When we are younger, our bone marrow contains very little fat. As we age, the percentage of fat in our marrow increases.' "
What is a bone marrow procedure (aspiration and/or biopsy)?,'A bone marrow procedure (commonly referred to as a bone marrow or bone marrow aspiration with or without biopsy or trephination) is a technique used to obtain a sample of the blood-forming portion (marrow) of the inner core of bone for examination in the laboratory. A bone marrow aspiration consists of inserting a special needle into a bone and withdrawing the bone marrow fluid by suction. A bone marrow biopsy takes out a larger piece of the bone marrow by coring out a sample of the marrow with a saw (termed a trephine) that ''cuts'' a small amount of bone tissue. This bone marrow examination can provide a more complete exam of the marrow than an aspirate.' 
What types of doctors perform bone marrow aspirates and/or bone marrow biopsies?,"'In general, internists, hematologists, oncologists, and transplant specialists are the doctors that usually perform bone marrow aspirates and/or biopsies.' "
Why are bone marrow biopsies or aspirations done?,"'Most bone marrow aspirations are performed to diagnose various conditions that affect the different types of blood cells. Abnormal blood counts can lead a doctor to suspect that there may be a problem in the bone marrow. Another frequent purpose of a bone marrow is to diagnose certain ''cancers'' or to determine the extent of a ''cancer'' (''cancer'' staging) that is present within the bone marrow. Bone marrow procedures can also detect uncommon nonhematologic conditions, both cancerous and noncancerous, including abnormal proteins (such as in ''amyloidosis''), inflammation (such as in ''sarcoidosis''), and infection (such as in ''tuberculosis''). This procedure can also be used to obtain marrow cells for transplantation.'""Bone marrow biopsies remove a core of bone to allow physicians to evaluate the structure and cellularity of the tissue with a microscope. These biopsies may reveal abnormalities of bone structure and any associated abnormal cells, protein deposits, or inflammatory processes. A bone marrow aspirate is primarily a liquid sample that reveals the mixed cell population of cells within the marrow. In contrast to a bone marrow biopsy, a bone marrow aspirate does not show the relationship of the cells to each other or to the bone, or the cells' precise location in relation to the bone. The procedures are often performed together, with an aspirate obtained prior to a biopsy.""  "
What bone is used to sample the bone marrow?,"'The most frequent site for obtaining bone marrow is the pelvic bone, known as the ilium (posterior iliac crest). A portion of this bone is readily accessible in most people from the lower back and is usually marked by shallow dimples on either side of the spine. Other sites include the front of the pelvic bone near the groin and the sternum (breastbone) at the front of the chest. However, the sternum is sampled only for aspiration and done in individuals older than 12 years of age. This site is considered to be ""a last resort"" because the sternum is thin and there is risk of penetrating the underlying soft tissues. The tibia (shinbone) is sampled only in infants younger than 1 year of age; it is not sampled in adults because it may not yield a sufficient sample of bone marrow cells.' "
How do physicians perform a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy?,"'Typically, only a local anesthetic is required to numb the skin and tissue down to the surface of the bone although some patients may require a sedative. A physician makes a small cut (less than ¼ inch) in the skin and then uses a hollow needle, whose center is filled by a removable metal rod (called a trocar), to penetrate through the dense outer shell of bone. This needle (the most popular is termed the Jamshidi needle) can be used for both aspiration of marrow liquid or for a needle biopsy core of solid material. Once inside the bone, the trocar is removed and a syringe is attached to the now hollow tube of the bone marrow needle. The bone marrow is withdrawn as a thick liquid by pulling back on the plunger of the syringe and collecting the liquid. This sample is known as the marrow aspirate. This part of the procedure only lasts a few seconds but is usually the most painful due to the sudden sense of a negative pressure inside the bone.''A biopsy can also then be obtained in addition to the marrow aspirate or when an aspirate cannot be obtained. The same needle is used but without the center portion in place. As the needle is partially rotated into the bone, it cuts a core that is trapped inside the needle. Once the needle is removed, this core can be extracted from the needle barrel. This core can then be prepared with fixatives and stains for examination under a microscope.''Since the skin cut for both bone marrow procedures is usually very small, no ''stitches'' are generally necessary and only a bandage is applied. Recovery from the procedures is usually rapid (about one day, although some patients may feel tenderness at the site for about a week). Any post-procedure bleeding should be addressed by your physician. Those patients who require IV sedation will require someone to bring them home and should remain fairly sedentary for about 24 hours.'""The cost of a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy varies greatly; it depends on the location (hospital or doctor's office), insurance coverage, and the country. Consequently, the cost range is wide (from about several hundred dollars to several thousand dollars) and may or may not include additional testing of the sample."" "
What is done with the bone marrow sample?,"'The bone marrow core biopsy is first placed in a liquid that keeps the cells in their natural condition (fixative solution). The sample is then placed in a solution to soften the bone and is finally processed like other biopsies in the tissue study (histology) laboratory. The liquid portion of the bone marrow is spread on glass slides and stained to make the bone marrow smears. The slides are then examined under the microscope, usually by a specially qualified technician followed by a physician such as a hematologist or pathologist. The results of aspiration or bone marrow biopsy are examined for abnormal-appearing cells, a reduced or increased amount of normal bone marrow cells as compared to normal marrow values, and the presence or absence of cancer cells as well as other abnormal structures. Portions of either sample may be submitted to the microbiology laboratory for cultures or other studies to identify infections. Certain conditions may require other specialized studies such as genetic testing or cell marker studies.' "
What diseases are diagnosed by bone marrow examination?,"'A wide variety of conditions can be diagnosed by examination of the bone marrow. The following examples illustrate some of the most frequent conditions, but there are many more. The presence or absence of cancer in the bone marrow can determine what treatments are recommended to a patient with cancer known to be elsewhere in the body. Some cancers (''leukemia'', ''multiple myeloma'', ''polycythemia'', pancytopenia) arise from cells in the marrow, so this is where the biopsy must be taken to confirm the diagnosis. Other cancers, like ''lymphomas'', can spread to the bones. A low blood-clotting element (''platelet count'') in the blood (''thrombocytopenia'') can be due to several causes. It is important to establish whether or not the cells that make the platelets (megakaryocytes) are still present in the marrow (''idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura'' [''ITP'']) or are gone (along with most other bone marrow cells as in aplastic ''anemia''). Most cases of ''anemia'' (low ''red blood cells'') can be diagnosed by simple blood tests. When these tests are negative, examining the marrow can reveal problems with the red blood cells that are uncommon causes of anemia (sideroblastic anemia, aplastic anemia). Persistent ''fevers'' can be caused by infections that reside in the marrow (atypical mycobacteria, ''brucellosis'') and a sample of the marrow may provide the best source of culture material.' "
"What are the risks 
or complications of a bone marrow procedure?","'Different individuals feel the ''pain'' caused by injection of the local anesthetic and the remainder of the procedure to a variable extent. There may be dull soreness for a day or two. Significant complications are very unusual but can include bleeding and infection and prolonged ''pain''. This procedure is only done by experienced physicians using special bone marrow needles. Bone marrow biopsies are done almost exclusively from pelvic bones. It is unsafe to perform a bone marrow biopsy on the sternum, so a special needle with a guard on it is used for sternal marrow aspirations to prevent the needle from going too deep. Some individuals may develop bleeding problems at the site or if an artery is cut.''Rare fatalities have been reported, usually during sternal marrow aspirations when the needle has penetrated the sternum and cut one of the arteries on the surface of the ''heart''.''Some researchers use bone marrow aspirates in ''clinical trials'' to collect marrow cells that can be modified for experimental treatments for several different diseases.' "
What is peripheral blood stem cell transplantation?,"'Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is a treatment which involve first harvesting specific cells called\xa0''stem cells'""\xa0from the peripheral blood of the donor. These cells are harvested by a type of filtration and then preserved, usually by freezing, and finally given to the recipient after he or she has received intensive treatment. The stem cells are usually given instead of bone marrow cells. They go to the recipient's bone marrow spaces and rebuild the bone marrow after the intensive treatment is over. The treatment does not involve surgery, but is nevertheless a form of transplantation."" "
What are stem cells?,"'Stem cells are small, round cells with a squat nucleus and scant surrounding cytoplasm. Although unremarkable in appearance, stem cells can perform what have been called ""acts of biological resurrection."" ' "
What do stem cells do?,"'Whereas other types of cells in the body have a limited lifespan and die after dividing their predetermined number of times, a stem cell can reproduce forever. The stem cell is immortal (in cellular terms). A stem cell can forgo immortality and differentiate. By doing so, it can turn into an ordinary blood cell, like a red blood cell (an erythrocyte), a white blood cell (a leukocyte), or a large cell (a megakaryocyte) that fragments into the platelets needed for blood to clot.' "
What is the value of stem cells for transplantation?,"'A relatively small number of stem cells can miraculously repopulate the whole bone marrow, provide an endless supply of stem cells, reconstitute the entire repertoire of blood cells, and restore that portion of the immune system.' "
Where do the stem cells come from for transplantation?,"'Under normal circumstances, stem cells are rarely seen in the blood stream. To recruit enough stem cells into the blood, stem cells are lured out of the bone marrow by a special regimen of ''drugs'' and thereby coaxed into entering the peripheral blood (the blood stream).' "
How are the stem cells removed from the blood?,"'The blood is filtered through a machine and the stem cells are skimmed off. The removal of the cells is termed ''pheresis'' or ''apheresis'' (from the Greek ""aphairesis"" for removal). The stem cells then may be used right away for the transplant or stored suspended in DMSO and frozen in liquid nitrogen until needed.' "
"How is the patient ""prepared""  for the transplantation?","'Before the transplant is done, the patient receives high-dose ''chemotherapy'' and/or ''radiation therapy'' over several days to destroy diseased cells (the leukemic cells, ''lymphoma'' cells, solid ''tumor'' cells, the diseased immune system cells in ''scleroderma'', etc.)' "
How is the transplantation actually done?,"'Once the chemotherapy is gone, the stem cells are defrosted and returned to the patient as a ''blood transfusion''. They are already biologically programmed to migrate to the bone marrow, where they can produce new blood and immune cells and replace the cells destroyed by the treatment.''The stem-cell preparation is infused into a vein and, once there in the blood stream, the stem cells act like homing pigeons and head straight for the bone marrow space.' "
What is mastoiditis?,"'The mastoid bone is the back part of the temporal bone of the skull located just behind the inner ear. Mastoiditis is infection of the mastoid bone. The mastoid bone is made up of a honeycomb-like structure, which is full of mastoid air cells. The mastoid air cells can become infected or inflamed, often as a result of an inner ''ear infection'' (otitis media). If infection spreads outside the mastoid air cells into the mastoid bone (coalescent mastoiditis), serious health problems can arise.''Mastoiditis is more common in children, but it can affect adults as well.' "
What are the symptoms of mastoiditis?,'Symptoms of acute mastoiditis and chronic mastoiditis include:'   Pain or discomfort in or behind the ear (otalgia) Redness or tenderness behind the ear Swelling of the area behind the ear (this may cause the ear to stick out) Ear discharge (otorrhea) Fever Headache Hearing loss in the affected ear Swelling behind the eyes Irritability Tiredness Dizziness or spinning sensation (vertigo) (uncommon) Weakened facial muscles (uncommon)
What causes mastoiditis?,"'The most common cause of mastoiditis is an untreated ''inner ear infection'' (acute otitis media).''Less frequently, a condition called ''cholesteatoma'' can cause mastoiditis. Cholesteatoma is an abnormal growing collection of skin cells inside the ear that can prevent the ear from draining, which can lead to mastoiditis.'  "
What tests diagnose the cause of mastoiditis?,"'A doctor will do an examination of the ear canal with an otoscope to see inside the ear canal and visualize the eardrum (tympanic membrane) and structures within the middle ear if possible. Other tests may be ordered to confirm a diagnosis. These tests include:' CT scan of the temporal bone MRI scan of the ear and head X-ray of the skull Blood tests, including a white blood cell count and complete blood count (CBC) Culture of any fluids drained from the ear (via tympanocentesis, tympanostomy, or myringotomy) Hearing test (audiometry) Lumbar puncture or ""spinal tap"""
What home treatments relieve pain and other symptoms of mastoiditis?,"'Mastoiditis cannot be treated at home. It requires medical treatment, as the infection can spread and cause serious complications. Most of the home treatments are aimed at reducing symptoms of an ''ear infection'', which is the most common cause of mastoiditis.' Wear earplugs when swimming or showering to keep water out of the ears and keep an ear infection from worsening. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers and fever reducers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) may be taken for pain and inflammation. Do not give aspirin to children or teenagers, as it has been linked with Reye’s syndrome, a rare but serious disease. A warm compress held over the ear may help relieve some pain. Stay hydrated. Rest. Avoid air travel if possible, as flying may aggravate ear pain."
When does mastoiditis need to be treated with antibiotics or surgery?,"'You cannot treat mastoiditis at home. Early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics is needed to avoid complications. In some cases, intravenous (IV) antibiotics in a hospital may be required.''If antibiotics alone do not cure the infection, surgery may be needed. A myringotomy may be performed to drain the middle ear, and in more serious cases a mastoidectomy may be needed to remove part of the infected mastoid bone.'  "
Is mastoiditis life threatening?,"'If mastoiditis is treated promptly with antibiotics, it can often be cured. In some people, the infection comes back and another course of antibiotics is required.''If the infection spreads, serious and even life-threatening complications can occur such as:' Hearing loss that may be permanent Facial nerve palsy (facial paralysis) Bone infection (osteomyelitis) Inflammation of the inner ear nerves (labyrinthitis) Blood clots, including sinus thrombosis, which is a blood clot in the sinuses that drains blood from the brain Brain abscess (epidural abscess or subperiosteal abscess) or other intracranial complications Meningitis"
Can mastoiditis be prevented?,'The best way to prevent mastoiditis is to prevent ''ear infections'' (otitis media) and treat any ''ear infection'' you have with antibiotic therapy.''Ways to prevent acute middle ''ear infections'' include:' Wash hands frequently to prevent the spread of cold and flu viruses. Keep children away from secondhand smoke. Studies have shown children who are around smokers get more ear infections than children not exposed to smoke. Be sure your child gets the flu vaccine yearly. Vaccinated children get fewer ear infections than non-vaccinated children. Limit your child's exposure to other children who have a cold or the flu.
Introduction to Masturbation,"'Masturbation is the self-stimulation of the genitals to achieve sexual arousal and pleasure, usually to the point of ''orgasm'' (sexual climax). It is commonly done by touching, stroking, or massaging the penis or clitoris until an orgasm is achieved. Some women also use stimulation of the vagina to masturbate or use ""sex toys,"" such as a vibrator. ' "
Who Masturbates?,"""Just about everybody. Masturbation is a very common behavior, even among people who have sexual relations with a partner. In one national study, 95% of males and 89% of females reported that they have masturbated. Masturbation is the first sexual act experienced by most males and females. In young children, masturbation is a normal part of the growing child's exploration of his or her body. Most people continue to masturbate in adulthood, and many do so throughout their lives. "" "
Why Do People Masturbate?,"'In addition to feeling good, masturbation is a good way of relieving the sexual tension that can build up over time, especially for people without partners or whose partners are not willing or available for sex. Masturbation also is a safe sexual alternative for people who wish to avoid ''pregnancy'' and the dangers of ''sexually transmitted diseases''. It also is necessary when a man must give a semen sample for  ''infertility'' testing or for sperm donation. When sexual dysfunction is present in an adult, masturbation may be prescribed by a sex therapist to allow a person to experience an orgasm (often in women) or to delay its arrival (often in men). ' "
Is Masturbation Normal?,"'While it once was regarded as a perversion and a sign of a mental problem, masturbation now is regarded as a normal, healthy sexual activity that is pleasant, fulfilling, acceptable and safe. It is a good way to experience sexual pleasure and can be done throughout life. ''Masturbation is only considered a problem when it inhibits sexual activity with a partner, is done in public, or causes significant distress to the person. It may cause distress if it is done compulsively and/or interferes with daily life and activities. ' "
Is Masturbation Harmful?,""" In general, the medical community considers masturbation to be a natural and harmless expression of sexuality for both men and women. It does not cause any physical injury or harm to the body, and can be performed in moderation throughout a person's lifetime as a part of normal sexual behavior. Some cultures and religions oppose the use of masturbation or even label it as sinful. This can lead to guilt or shame about the behavior. ""'Some experts suggest that masturbation can actually improve ''sexual health'' and relationships. By exploring your own body through masturbation, you can determine what is erotically pleasing to you and can share this with your partner. Some partners use mutual masturbation to discover techniques for a more satisfying sexual relationship and to add to their mutual intimacy. ''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)?,"'Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a relatively rare type of ''cancer'' of the lymphoid cells; it is termed mantle cell lymphoma because the ''cancer'' cells (lymphoma cells) arise from the outer rim or mantle of lymphoid cells that surround a lymphoid follicle. MCL is an aggressive B-cell type of '""non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"""", and the rare disease accounts for about 2%-10% of non-Hodgkin's ""'lymphomas''.' "
What causes mantle cell lymphoma?,"'About 85% of patients with MCL have a characteristic genetic lesion known as a reciprocal translocation, in which short segments of one chromosome are moved to another chromosome. The characteristic change in MCL involves chromosomes 11 and 14 and is called t(11;14). The exchange of chromosomal material occurs at the location of the cyclin D1 gene (BCL-1, now referred to as CCND1) on chromosome 11; the change causes an overproduction of cyclin D1, a protein that stimulates ''tumor'' cell division and growth. This genetic change is considered a driver in the behavior of MCL, which likely works together with other genetic defects to cause MCL. In a small number of patients, t(11;14) is not present. In most of these patients without the characteristic translocation, other genetic changes cause excess production of cyclin D1.' "
What are risk factors for mantle cell lymphoma?,"'There is a lack of agreement in the medical literature on specific risk factors for MCL, although family history and certain genetic changes have been identified that increase the risk. MCL affects males about four times as commonly as females. Blacks and Asians are less likely than whites to develop MCL. Age is a risk factor; the median age of MCL onset is 60 years of age with an age range of 35-85 years.' "
What are signs and symptoms of mantle cell lymphoma?,'Signs and symptoms of MCL may include the following:' Fever Night sweats Generalized enlargement of lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) Fatigue Abdominal distention from an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) Abdominal decision from enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) Weight loss (in about 40% of patients) Spread of the cancer into other organs (extranodal spread) may produce organ-specific symptoms.
"What types of health care professionals diagnose and treat mantle cell 
lymphoma?","""Specialists in cancer treatment (oncologists, hematologists, surgeons, and radiologists), in conjunction with one's primary care physician, treat mantle cell lymphoma."" "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose mantle cell lymphoma?,"'Health care professionals diagnose MCL with needle aspirates of lymph nodes and determine staging by needle aspirates or biopsies of bone marrow. CT, blood tests, and immunotyping (examining the specific molecules expressed on the surface of the lymphoma cells) of cancer cells may be done to further delineate spread and other characteristics of your MCL. Testing for overexpression of the cyclin D1 protein and for the presence of the t(11,14) genetic abnormality are also performed.' "
What are the stages of mantle cell lymphoma?,"'There are four stages of mantle cell lymphoma. Stage I and stage II describe localized MCL. Many patients are seen by physicians in stage III (intermediate-grade or stage) in which the MCL cancer cells have begun to proliferate outside of the nodes, and 70% percent of patients are first diagnosed in stage IV (advanced-stage) in which the cancer cells have gone into masses, often replacing lymph nodes and have spread into other body organs.' "
What is the treatment for mantle cell lymphoma?,"'Treatment of mantle cell lymphoma is difficult because patients usually receive their diagnosis in stage IV, where the MCL has advanced throughout the body. There are many different therapeutic regimens (single-agent and combined ''drugs'') to treat MCL; most include multiple chemotherapy drug administrations (for example, high-dose Ara-C and others). ''Rituximab'' (''Rituxan''), in combination with other chemotherapy drugs, typically treats patients who have MCL. Rituxan is a monoclonal antibody used to treat different ''cancers'' of the lymphoid cells. Newer chemotherapy drugs used for MCL include bortezomib (''Velcade''). Other treatments include autologous stem cell transplantation and R-hyper-CVAD (rituximab hyper CVAD), a more intensive form of chemotherapy (drug intensified ''chemo''-immunotherapy) and R-DHAP chemotherapy for refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. Some patients may benefit from surgical debulking (removal of tissue to reduce symptoms). There is no cure for MCL; health care providers administer treatments to reduce symptoms and/or to increase limited survival time.''Patients should speak with their physician team members to decide what treatment options are best, as there are new specialized drug treatments and protocols continually appearing in the medical literature. For example, ibrutinib (Imbruvica) is a new formulation (one pill per day) that patients who have obtained at least one prior therapy can use.'  "
What are complications of mantle cell lymphoma?,"'Besides the signs and symptoms caused by mantle cell lymphoma, the major complications of MCL are decreased lifespan and death. Other complications come from treatments, mainly chemotherapy treatment, and include the following:' Infection Anemia Neutropenia (a reduced number of infection fighting cells) Thrombocytopenia (reduced platelet count) Fatigue Neuropathy Nausea Vomiting Dehydration Damage to the heart from certain chemotherapy drugs"
What is the prognosis of mantle cell lymphoma?,"'MCL has a poor prognosis, even with appropriate therapy. Usually, physicians note treatment failures in less than 18 months, and the median survival time of individuals with MCL is about two to five years. The 10-year survival rate is only about 5%-10%. However, some researchers claim to have doubled the median survival rate in younger patients (less than 65 years of age) treated with an intensive regimen of chemotherapy in clinical trials.'  "
Is it possible to prevent mantle cell lymphoma?,"'Currently, there is no known way to prevent the genetic changes that drive MCL.' "
Are there clinical trials for mantle cell lymphoma?,"'Yes, there clinical trials for mantle cell lymphoma. For example, an open-label phase 2 trial of several drugs, alone and in combination in treatment for refractory mantle cell lymphoma found evidence that a triple combination of drugs warrants evaluation. For further information and a list of those trials and their locations, please visit ''https://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/listings/condition/628/mantle-cell-lymphoma''.' "

What is the medial collateral ligament (MCL)?,"'The knee joint allows the lower leg to flex (bend) or straighten (extend). To make certain that those are the only two motions that occur, there are four ligaments in the knee that help control and protect it.''Ligaments are tough bands of tissue that span a joint and attach to the bones on each side of it. The MCL is located on the inside of the knee (medial aspect) and is attached to the femur (thighbone) and tibia (shinbone). The MCL holds the knee stable when a valgus stress is placed on the outer part of the leg that could potentially buckle the knee toward the center of the body.''The muscles that surround the knee, especially the ''quadriceps'' muscles located in the front of the thigh, and the hamstrings located in the back of the thigh, are also important stabilizers of the knee joint.' The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is located on the medial aspect of the knee (medial = the closest to the center of the body) or inside of the knee. The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) is located on the lateral aspect of the knee (lateral = away from the center of the body) or outside of the knee. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) prevent anterior (frontward) and posterior (backward) movement of the knee joint."
What are the different types of medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries?,"'A sprain is an injury to a ligament. Like any other sprain, health care providers grade knee ligament injuries by their severity. A grade I sprain refers to when one stretches but does not tear the fibers of the ligament. MCL tears are grade II sprains if the ligament fibers are partially torn. MCL tears are a grade III sprain when the ligament is completely torn.''Because of the anatomy and how the MCL is related to the medial meniscus (cartilage) and the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament), these two structures may also be damaged in association with an MCL injury.' "
"What are causes and risk factors of medial collateral ligament (MCL) 
injuries?","'Medial collateral ligament injuries are the most common ligament sprains of the knee. They are also one of the common sports injuries and can occur in any age group. The most common risks include contact sports, including football, hockey, wrestling, and martial arts. Males tend to be more at risk than females.''MCL injuries occur usually from a sudden impact to the outer part of knee. The injury may be either due to contact, a blow to the outside part of the knee, or noncontact due to twisting, cutting, or stopping suddenly (deceleration).' "
What are medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury symptoms and signs?,"'Pain'' is the first symptom of an MCL ''knee injury''. It typically occurs almost immediately and is located along the course of the ligament. Sometimes this is associated with swelling within the knee joint. Occasionally, swelling develops in a matter of minutes. The ''knee pain'' of an MCL knee injury may also cause the person to limp in order to protect the knee joint.'  "
What tests diagnose and assess medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries?,"'The diagnosis of an MCL sprain is usually made by history and physical examination. The patient often knows the mechanism of the knee injury, that is precisely what they were doing and what position their body was in when the injury occurred. This helps the health-care professional understand the stresses that were put on the knee joint. Other questions might include whether the patient was able to walk, whether the knee began to swell, and how long it took for that to happen after the injury.''The physical examination includes looking at the knee to see whether or not it is swollen and touching the knee in various places to find places of tenderness and ''pain''. With MCL sprains, there is tenderness along the course of the ligament on the inner aspect of the knee.''The ligament can also be stressed on physical examination to determine whether the knee ligament is stable or whether there is joint laxity. By pushing on the outer side of the knee (reproducing the valgus stress that often causes the knee injury), the examiner can determine if the MCL is stable or unstable. This can be a rough assessment of the grade of sprain, where a grade I sprain is stable and a grade III sprain is unstable.''Physical examination concentrates on the knee joint and the hip and ankle to identify any other associated injuries.''There are other causes of inner (posteromedial and medial) ''knee pain''. One cause is inflammation of the anserinus bursa, where some of the hamstring muscles attach near the medial collateral ligament in the tibia. This bursa is one of the nearby the medial collateral ligament that may be inflamed and cause acute or ''chronic pain'' that can mimic an MCL injury.''Plain X-rays of the knee can identify ''fractures'' of the femur and tibia bones. An MRI is the best way to actually visualize the MCL and determine the grade of sprain, but it is not always necessary. If there is concern that there is also a tear of the medial meniscus or anterior cruciate ligament, an MRI may be appropriate.''If there has been ''chronic pain'' and inflammation, calcification along the insertion of the MCL into the femur can occur. This is referred to as a Pellegrini-Stieda lesion and usually causes no symptoms (asymptomatic). Less commonly, there can be associated pain and decreased knee range of motion that will require treatment.'  "
What is the treatment for a medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury?,"'MCL sprains tend to heal with rest and physical therapy to help return range of motion and strengthen the muscles that surround and protect the knee. While sports is a high-risk activity, may people injure their knees in their daily work and home routines. Primary care providers, orthopedic surgeons and sports medicine providers routinely assess and treat these patients. Physical therapists are often an important part of the treatment team.''Grade I and II sprains tend to heal within one to two weeks. The initial treatment often includes wearing a knee sleeve or hinged knee brace for comfort and protection and to increase range of motion and activity as tolerated. Patients will usually need crutches for a few days.''Health care providers usually treat grade III sprains similarly but forgo a knee sleeve for a hinged brace. Some health care professionals suggest immediate range of motion while others like to wait a few weeks before allowing the knee to move. Patients may return to play or work in six to eight weeks.' "
Is surgery required for medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries?,"'Historically, grade III MCL sprains were candidates for surgery, but more recently, doctors only consider surgery in patients where conservative (nonsurgical) treatment has failed.''Surgery is a primary treatment in patients who have also damaged their medial meniscus and/or their anterior cruciate ligament.' "
Are there any home remedies for MCL injuries?,"'The initial treatment for an MCL sprain is the same as other sprains, including rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Because of the associated pain, using crutches to assist with ''walking'' is appropriate.''Anti-inflammatory medications like ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil'') or ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'') may be helpful for pain control. While these are ''over-the-counter'' medications, there may be reasons when this class of medications may not appropriate for a specific patient. It is wise to check with a health-care provider or pharmacist for any questions or concerns.' "
What are possible complications of medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries?,"'Instability is the major complication of a grade III MCL sprain. While avoiding surgery and undergoing physical therapy is the mainstay of treatment, there are some patients where the MCL remains unstable and the ligament loose and causes knee joint laxity. These patients often benefit from surgery to repair the MCL but only after initial nonsurgical therapy has failed.' "
What is the prognosis of a medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury? What is the recovery time for an MCL injury?,"'Most athletes with MCL injuries are able to return to play within a few weeks of injury. Those who have sustained grade I and II sprains can be competing within one to two weeks, while those with grade III sprains may need longer, about six to eight weeks to recover.' "
Is it possible to prevent a medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury?,"""It's not possible to prevent MCL sprains except by avoiding traumatic physical contact. They are the consequence of being active in a sport or because of an unexpected accident. In sports, there is controversy as to whether or not wearing a brace can help to protect the MCL."" "

What is measles? What does measles look like?,"'Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can be fatal. In most people, the disease produces fever (temperature > 101 F [38.3 C]), a generalized ''rash'' that lasts greater than 3 days, ''cough'', runny nose (coryza), and ''red eyes'' (''conjunctivitis''). The complications of measles that result in most deaths include ''pneumonia'' and inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).'  "
What is rubeola? What is rubella? What are other names for measles?,"'Rubeola'' is the scientific name used for measles. People often confuse rubeola with ''rubella'' (''German measles'').''Rubella'' is the scientific name used of German measles, a different viral illness. While German measles is rarely fatal, it is dangerous in that infection of pregnant women causes ''birth defects'' and can cause ''miscarriage'' and fetal death.''Other terms describe measles. These include (erroneously) ''rubella'', hard measles, red measles, 7-day measles, 8-day measles, 9-day measles, 10-day measles, and morbilli.' "
What is the history of measles and vaccines?,"'People have described cases of measles as early as the seventh century. However, it was not until 1963 that researchers first developed a vaccine to prevent measles. Before the vaccine was available, the measles virus infected almost every child because it spreads so easily. Before routine vaccination, there were approximately 3-4 million cases of measles and 500 deaths due to measles each year in the United States.''There were initially two types of ''vaccines'' developed against measles. Researchers developed one from a killed virus, and they developed the other using a live measles virus that was weakened (attenuated) and could no longer cause the disease. Unfortunately, the killed measles virus (KMV) vaccine was not effective in preventing people from getting the disease, and medical professionals discontinued its use in 1967. The live virus vaccine has been modified a number of times to make it safer (further attenuated) and today is extremely effective in preventing the disease. The currently used vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine.' "
Is measles contagious?,"'Measles is a highly contagious viral illness that spreads easily from person to person, especially in those without previous vaccination. The pathogen responsible for measles is the rubeola virus.' "
What is the contagious period for measles?,'The infected person is highly contagious for 4 days before the ''rash'' appears until 4 days after the rash appears. The measles virus can remain in the air (and still be able to cause disease) for up to 2 hours after an infected person has left a room.' 
What causes measles? How does measles spread?,"'The measles virus (rubeola virus, a paramyxovirus, genus ''Morbillivirus'') causes measles.''Measles spreads through droplet transmission from the nose, throat, and mouth of someone infected with the virus. These droplets spray out when the infected person ''coughs'' or sneezes. Among unimmunized people exposed to the virus, over 90% will contract the disease.' "
How does one become immune to measles?,"'Anyone who has had measles is immune for life. People who have received two doses of vaccine after their first birthday have a 98% likelihood of being immune. Infants receive some immunity from their mother. Unfortunately, this immunity is not complete, and infants are at increased risk for infection until they receive the first dose of vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age. Children receive the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age.' "
What are measles symptoms and signs?,"'A typical case of measles actually starts with a''After 2 to 4 days of these symptoms, the patient may develop spots within the mouth called Koplik spots. These spots look like little grains of white or bluish-white sand surrounded by a red ring and are usually found inside the cheek toward the back of the mouth (opposite the first and second upper molars).''The skin rash (also known as an exanthem or exanthema) appears 3 to 5 days after the onset of the initial symptoms (fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes). The rash is a flat to slightly raised (maculopapular) red rash that usually last 5 to 6 days. It begins at the hairline and then progresses to the face and upper neck. Over the next 2 to 3 days, the rash progresses downward to cover the entire body, including the hands and ''feet''. The rash has mostly distinct lesions, but some may overlap (become confluent). Initially, these lesions will turn white when you press on them (blanch). After 3 to 4 days, they no longer will blanch. As the rash begins to fade, there will often be a fine flaking of the skin (desquamation). The rash fades in the same order that it appears.''The fever that occurs with measles is called a stepwise fever. The patient starts with a mild fever that progressively gets higher. ''Fevers'' often reach temperatures greater than 103 F (39.4 C).''Although not as common as other symptoms, some patients may have a ''sore throat''.'   fever, runny nose, hacking cough, and red eyes (conjunctivitis)."
Who is at risk for getting measles?,"'Those people at high risk for measles include' children less than 1 year of age (although they have some immunity passed from their mother, it is not 100% effective); people who have not received the proper vaccination series; people who received immunoglobulin at the time of measles vaccination; people immunized from 1963 until 1967 with an older ineffective killed measles vaccine."
Is measles deadly?,"'While measles can be fatal, it has rarely been fatal for the last 20 years in the United States. However, in 2016, 89,000 children died worldwide due to measles. About one in 500 to one in 1,000 people who contract measles will die. The low rate of death in the U.S. is because most people received immunizations, which resulted in very infrequent outbreaks. However, with increasing numbers of people who refuse vaccination in the U.S., there are likely going to be more complications and deaths from measles in the future. The people most likely to have complications (including death) are those who are malnourished or who have weakened immune systems.' "
What is the danger of getting measles while pregnant?,"'If a woman contracts measles while she is pregnant, she may have a miscarriage, a ''stillbirth'', or a preterm delivery. The infant can also be born with measles infection. There appears to be no risk of having birth defects (unlike an infection with the ''rubella'' virus, known as German measles).' "
What is the incubation period for measles?,'The typical time from exposure to a person infected with measles to development of the initial symptoms (incubation period) is 10-12 days (the range is 7 to 21 days). The rash occurs a few days after the initial symptoms (ranges from 7 to 18 days from exposure).' 
What is atypical measles?,"'Atypical measles occurs in people who received the killed measles vaccine (KMV; only used from 1963 until 1967) and who have an exposure to wild-type measles virus. The KMV unfortunately sensitizes the patient to the measles virus but does not offer any protection. The disease is characterized by fever, pleural effusions, ''pneumonia'', and swelling of the extremities. The rash of atypical measles is different from measles in that it may have an urticarial component (''hives'') and usually appears first on the ankles and wrists.''The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends that people who may have received the KMV should receive revaccination with the live measles vaccine.' "
What is modified measles?,"'Modified measles appears in patients who, because they were unimmunized, received immune globulin after exposure to a patient with measles. It also appears occasionally in young infants who have limited immunity from their mothers. The immune globulin prolongs the time from exposure to onset of symptoms (incubation period). When the symptoms do occur, they are much milder than those seen with normal measles and tend to last a shorter period of time.' "
What types of doctors treat measles?,"'Any physician (including primary care physicians and pediatricians) can treat measles; however, most times there will be an infectious disease doctor consulted to be sure that the diagnosis is correct. Sometimes a general practitioner may consult a dermatologist, as well. Many physicians in current practice have never seen a case of measles, which makes it more difficult for them to diagnose it. If the patient has pneumonia or encephalitis, they may be in the intensive care unit and treated by critical care physicians.' "
How do medical professionals make a diagnosis of measles?,"'The diagnosis of suspected measles is mostly clinical, meaning that the appearance and history of the patient suggest the diagnosis. In a person with known exposure to someone with measles or travel to a foreign country, health care providers should always consider measles when faced with a patient who has a high fever and characteristic rash. Until the rash appears, the presence of Koplik spots should help to suggest the diagnosis. Most cases of suspected measles in the United States turn out not to be measles (see below). It is recommended that the diagnosis be confirmed using a blood test for IgM, a type of antibody against the virus. If the IgM test is positive, medical professionals should obtain viral cultures. Contact the state and local health department immediately for any suspected case in order to follow the correct procedures for viral culture and isolation of the patient. Further information on laboratory testing of suspected measles cases is available from the CDC (''http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt07-measles.html'').' "
"If it is not measles, what else could it be?","'There are many infectious diseases and other conditions that can cause some of the ''symptoms of measles''. These include, but are not limited to, ''dengue fever'', drug reactions, enteroviral infections, ''fifth disease'', German measles (rubella), ''Kawasaki disease'', ''Rocky Mountain spotted fever'', ''roseola'', and ''toxic shock syndrome''. It is important that a medical expert see suspected measles cases and order appropriate laboratory tests.' "
What should someone do if he or she has been exposed to measles?,"'People who have been appropriately vaccinated (or who have had the disease) and who are exposed to a patient with measles do not need to do anything. If an unimmunized person is exposed to a patient with measles, they should receive the vaccine as soon as possible. This may prevent the disease if given within 72 hours of exposure. Immune globulin may have some benefit if given within 6 days of exposure. The CDC recommends that household contacts of infected people, immunocompromised people, and pregnant women receive immune globulin. It is not recommended that health care professionals use immune globulin to control a measles outbreak.' "
Is there any treatment for measles after symptoms and signs develop?,"'The treatment of patients with measles focuses on symptom relief.'   Specific complications like pneumonia may require antibiotics. Home remedies are simply symptomatic treatment with acetaminophen (Tylenol), lots of rest, and fluids. Patients should be on bed rest until the fever has resolved and should remain well hydrated. In malnourished patients, doctors recommend vitamin A supplementation. Patients should be isolated to prevent spread of the disease."
What are complications seen with measles?,"'Some cases of measles have an associated complication. These complications can include ''diarrhea'', middle ''ear infections'', pneumonia, ''blindness'', acute brain inflammation (encephalitis, which is very rare), and persistent brain inflammation (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis or SSPE, which is extremely rare).''Blindness associated with measles is due to a combination of poor ''nutrition'' (specifically vitamin A deficiency) and the measles infection. Prevention is the most effective treatment. In third-world countries, post-measles blindness is the leading cause of blindness.''Acute encephalitis, although rare, is extremely dangerous and results in death in a significant percentage of patients who develop it. When it occurs, acute encephalitis generally starts 6 days after onset of the rash. Symptoms can include fever, ''headache'', ''vomiting'', ''stiff neck'', drowsiness, ''seizures'', and ''coma''.''Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is an extremely rare degenerative condition of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). A chronic infection of the central nervous system with the measles virus causes SSPE. Typically, symptoms start years after the patient had measles (average seven years, range 1 month to 27 years). The patient has a slow and progressive loss of brain function, ''seizures'', and eventually death results. There is no known treatment for SSPE.''Most deaths from measles are due to pneumonia in children and encephalitis in adults. The people most likely to have complications (including death) are those who are malnourished or who have weakened immune systems (for example, people with ''AIDS'' or other conditions that weaken the immune system).' "
Is it possible to prevent measles with a vaccine? How effective is the measles vaccine?,"'The only way to prevent measles is by receiving measles immunization: This is commonly given as a two-shot series that contains measles, ''mumps'', and rubella vaccine (MMR) or a shot containing measles, mumps, rubella, and ''varicella'' (''chickenpox'') vaccine (MMRV). Health care professionals do not recommend the MMRV for anyone older than 12 years of age. The current recommendation is that everyone receive two doses of the vaccine after 1 year of age. If a person receives the vaccine before 1 year of age, the person should receive two additional doses.''The measles-containing ''vaccines'' (MMR and MMRV) are not 100% effective, and this is why it is critical that everyone receives an immunization. When people skip ''vaccinations'', they put others at risk. This is why most states have laws requiring vaccination. Unfortunately, many states allow people to refuse vaccination based on varying criteria. Due to a sharp increase in the number of cases of measles in 2014 and 2015, there has been a renewed urgency to require immunization for everyone.''No vaccine is 100% effective. In 2012, the Cochrane Collaboration estimated that one dose of MMR would protect prevent 92% of secondary measles cases (a case caused by exposure to another person with the disease), and two doses would be 95% effective. However, if most of the population is immunized (known as herd immunity), the effectiveness of the vaccine is markedly increased. When under-vaccinated groups of close-knit communities are exposed to a single individual with measles, an outbreak can develop very quickly, as occurred in 2019.''The measles vaccine is also available as a single vaccine. However, in most cases, there is no reason to utilize the measles vaccine alone without mumps and rubella vaccine. The complete schedule of recommended vaccinations is available from the CDC (''http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html'').' "
What is the prognosis for measles?,"'Most people who contract measles will recover completely. Very few people who get measles will die. People who are malnourished or immunocompromised are more likely to have complications or die. However, it is possible for any person to die from the measles, which highlights the importance of vaccination. Almost no one who has been vaccinated has died from the disease.' "
Why should people get the measles vaccine?,"'Although measles was extremely rare in the United States in the 1990s and early 2000s, recently, there has been a marked increased number of cases.''When the number of vaccinated individuals starts to decrease, the disease starts to occur more frequently. This occurred from 1989 until 1991 in the U.S. During that period, there were 55,000 cases and 123 deaths from measles in the U.S. Due to a massive public health effort, almost all children in the U.S. received the measles vaccine before entering school. The number of cases of measles in the U.S. dropped to only 37 in 2004. At that time, most cases originated outside of the U.S. These cases came from three common sources: infants being adopted from China, U.S. ''travelers'' being exposed while out of the country (now most commonly from European travel), and from foreign ''travelers'' visiting the U.S.''However, in 2011, the number of cases grew to 222 because more people avoided vaccinations. Fortunately, there were no deaths among those 222. In 2014, the number of cases jumped dramatically to 644 cases, and there were 14 separate outbreaks. The largest outbreak was due to many unvaccinated children and adults in an Amish community in Ohio. A large multistate outbreak of measles started in December 2014 at Disneyland in California and continued into 2015. There were 48 cases of measles in 13 states in the first half of 2016. Most of the recent outbreaks traced back to individuals who refused vaccination and had foreign travel prior to onset of the illness. In 2018, an outbreak in New York City resulted in 58 cases and cost the health department over $400,000.''Many states allow people to refuse vaccination for religious reasons (although no organized religion prohibits vaccination) and 17 states allow parents to refuse vaccinations for philosophical reasons. The only way to prevent this problem is to change laws so that parents can no longer refuse vaccination except for documented ''allergy'' to vaccine components. Many states have up to 40% of preschoolers without proper vaccinations.' "
Why is the U.S. measles outbreak of 2019 so concerning?,"'The ongoing 2019 outbreak in the U.S. reported 1,203 measles cases in 30 states as of Aug. 15, 2019. This is the largest outbreak in over 28 years. Of the 1,203 measles cases, most were in unvaccinated people. The largest number of cases occurred in New York state, followed by Washington state. Close-knit communities accounted for most of cases. Since Aug. 19, 2019, there have been 654 measles cases in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg, Queens, and Borough Park, and there were 296 cases in the northern suburb of Rockland County as of Aug. 15, 2019. This led health officials to mandate immunizations, and those who refuse vaccinations could face arrest. The cost of the current outbreak has already cost millions of dollars, and economists estimate the cost could be more than $40 million by the time they contain the outbreak.' "
Why do some Orthodox Jews refuse vaccination?,"'In the most recent 2019 outbreak of measles in New York City, the hardest hit areas were in Ultra-Orthodox Jews from Brooklyn. While these people claim that Jewish law prohibits vaccination, many Jewish scholars have refuted that claim. The issue is apparently one of personal freedom more than religion. According to the CDC Vaccine Director Nancy Messonnier, outbreaks occur when unvaccinated people travel abroad to countries (like Israel) where there is widespread transmission of measles. The person becomes infected and returns to the United States. The concern is that these reckless actions could result in measles getting a foothold again here in the United States.' "
Does the Church of Scientology oppose vaccinations?,"'The Church of Scientology does not have an official policy against vaccinations or medical care in general. In April 2019, health officials quarantined a Church-owned cruise ship in the Caribbean nation of St. Lucia because one of the passengers developed measles.' "
What can I do if I have not received the vaccine and I am exposed to a person with measles?,"'If a person is exposed to measles, a few steps can help prevent getting the disease. This is known as post-exposure prophylaxis. If the exposure to measles has been within 3 days, the recommended course of action is immunization with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) or the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine. If it has been more than 72 hours, but less than 6 days, the person can receive immunoglobulin. These are not guaranteed to prevent measles, but it can decrease the likelihood of the illness.' "
Is there any truth to the fear of getting autism from the MMR or MMRV?,"'There is no valid scientific evidence that the measles vaccine, or any other vaccine, is the cause of ''autism''. Andrew Wakefield and colleagues proposed the possibility of an association between the measles vaccine and ''autism'' in 1998. The research published by Wakefield was found to be flawed and actually forged, and the results have not been able to be repeated by other researchers. ''The Lancet'', which published the original research in 1998, retracted the research publication in 2010. Since 1998, there have been numerous studies that have examined such an association. None of these studies have shown any risk of ''autism'' associated with the use of the vaccine. A recent study performed in Japan after the MMR vaccine was removed from the market showed that autism continued to increase after the vaccine was no longer being utilized. A recent study in Denmark showed that there was no increase in autism among vaccinated children. Although autism is a very serious disease that warrants good research to find out its many causes, not obtaining vaccinations is potentially dangerous and not supported by the best scientific data available today.' "
Who should not receive measles vaccinations?,"'The following groups of people should not receive measles vaccinations:''Patients with history of thrombocytopenic purpura or ''thrombocytopenia'' (low platelets) may be at increased risk, and immunization should be decided on a case-by-case basis.' People who have suffered a severe allergic reaction to either the measles vaccine or its components (gelatin or neomycin) should not receive the vaccine. Women known to be pregnant should not receive the vaccine. Avoid pregnancy for four weeks after vaccination. Severely immunocompromised patients (cancer patients or patients who are receiving large doses of corticosteroids) should not receive the vaccine. However, those leukemia patients who have been in remission for three months may receive the MMR. Patients with severe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections should not receive the vaccine. However, it is safe for asymptomatic patients with HIV to receive vaccinations. The CDC has issued guidelines for vaccination based on the CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. People with a moderate to severe acute illness should wait until their illness resolves before receiving the vaccine."
"Do people need to be revaccinated against measles if they are traveling to Europe 
and Israel?","'Europe and Israel have been experiencing recent epidemics of measles. This is likely due to poor vaccination rates in many European countries and Israel. It is not currently recommended to revaccinate people who have received at least two doses of the MMR vaccine. However, U.S. travelers should make sure that they have received at least two vaccinations against measles (MMR) prior to visiting any country outside of the United States.' "
What adverse reactions or side effects can occur with the measles vaccination?,"'Adverse reactions to measles vaccination (as part of the MMR) include fever, rash, joint aches, and ''low platelet count'' (thrombocytopenia). Some adult women will suffer ''joint pain'' that is due to the rubella component of the vaccine. The fever usually occurs 7 to 12 days after the vaccination, and the rash occurs 7 to 10 days after vaccination.'  "
"If a child has an egg allergy, can they still receive the measles vaccine?","'Although the measles vaccine is made using chick embryos, there is no evidence of increased reactions in people with an egg ''allergy''. Therefore, the CDC recommends giving MMR vaccine to egg-''allergic'' children without any prior skin testing or the use of special protocols.' "
"Who should be revaccinated 
(receive a booster shot) against measles?",'The following group of people should be considered unvaccinated and should receive at least one dose of vaccine:' People vaccinated before their first birthday should be revaccinated. Anyone known to have been vaccinated with the killed measles vaccine (KMV) should be revaccinated. Anyone vaccinated with KMV who received their dose of live measles vaccine with four months of their last dose of vaccine should be revaccinated. Anyone vaccinated before 1968 in whom it is not known if the vaccine was KMV or not should be revaccinated.
What should I do if I am not sure if I have been properly vaccinated or my vaccine records have been lost?,"'If you are unsure of your vaccine status against measles (especially if you are going to work in health care), you should have a blood test to measure your titer of antibodies against measles.' "
What is herd immunity? Why should people care if others choose not to be vaccinated?,"'Herd immunity is an increased effectiveness of a vaccine because significant proportion of a population is immunized. Some people do not actually develop immunity even though they have received the vaccine, and others, because of legitimate medical conditions (like ''cancer''), cannot receive the vaccine. Those people are put at extreme risk of infection and even death by those who simply choose not to be vaccinated. It is reasonable for everyone to expect others to be vaccinated. Due to the anti-vaccination movement, vaccination rates have fallen in the United States. By 2017, only 91% of children 19-35 months had received the MMR. This is below the rate (93%-95%) estimated by the CDC to be needed to maintain herd immunity and prevent outbreaks.' "
Can the measles virus be used to cure cancer?,"'In 2014, there were case reports of patients with ''multiple myeloma'' (a type of blood ""''cancer''"") being treated with a genetically engineered (altered) measles virus that attacks ''tumor'' cells. This is called virotherapy. This type of therapy has been used since the 1950s, but now there is renewed hope that this new use of the measles virus will bring hope to many patients with multiple ''myeloma''.' "

Introduction to Heart Valve Surgery,'Diseased ''heart'' valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and non-surgically (balloon valvuloplasty).' 
What Happens During Traditional Heart Valve Surgery?,"'During traditional heart valve surgery, a surgeon will make an incision down the center of your sternum (breastbone) to get direct access to your heart. The surgeon then repairs or replaces your abnormal heart valve or valves.'  "
What Happens During Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery?,"'Minimally invasive heart valve surgery is a type of surgery performed through smaller incisions. This type of surgery reduces blood loss, ''trauma'', and length of hospital stay.''Your surgeon will review your diagnostic tests prior to your surgery to determine if you are a candidate for minimally invasive valve surgery.''Often, the surgeon and cardiologist (heart doctor) will use transesophogeal echo (an ''ultrasound'' transducer probe that is passed down the throat) to help determine the functioning of the valve before and after surgery.' "
What Is Heart Valve Repair Surgery?,"'The ''mitral valve'' is the most commonly repaired heart valve, but the aortic, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques. The valves are made up of leaflets or flaps.''If your valve can be repaired, your surgeon will perform any of the following types of valve repair procedures.''The advantages of heart valve repair surgery include:' Commissurotomy. Fused valve leaflets, or flaps, are separated to widen the valve opening. Decalcification. Calcium deposits are removed to allow the leaflets to be more flexible and close properly. Reshape leaflets. If one of the leaflets is floppy, a segment may be cut out and the leaflet sewn back together, allowing the valve to close more tightly. This procedure is called quadrangular resection. Chordal transfer. If a leaflet of the mitral valve has prolapse (floppy; lacking support), the chordae are transferred from one leaflet to the other. Then, the leaflet where the chordae was removed is repaired by quandrangular resection (see above). Annulus support. If the valve annulus (the ring of tissue supporting the valve) is too wide, it may be reshaped or tightened by sewing a ring structure around the annulus. The ring may be made of tissue or synthetic material. Patched leaflets. The surgeon may use tissue patches to repair any leaflets with tears or holes. decreased need for life-long blood thinner (anticoagulant) medication preserved heart muscle strength"
What If My Valves Cannot Be Repaired?,"'When you have aortic or pulmonic ''heart valve disease'', valve replacement surgery is usually performed. In some cases, the ''aortic valve'' can be repaired.''During valve replacement surgery, the faulty valve is removed and a new valve is sewn to the annulus of your original valve. The new valve can be a:' Mechanical valve. It is made totally of mechanical parts that are tolerated well by the body. The bi-leaflet valve is used most often. It consists of two carbon leaflets in a ring covered with polyester knit fabric. Biological valve. Tissue valves (also called biologic or bioprosthetic valves) are made of human or animal tissue. Animal tissue heart valves may come from pig tissue (porcine) or cow tissue (bovine). Tissue valves may have some artificial parts to help give the valve support and to aid placement. Homograft valve (also called allograft). It is an aortic or pulmonic human valve that has been removed from a donated human heart, preserved, and frozen under sterile conditions. A homograft may be used to replace a diseased aortic or pulmonic valve."
What Are the Pros and Cons of Each Type of Heart Valve?," Mechanical heart valves. The advantage to mechanical heart valves is their sturdiness. They are designed to last for many years. There are also drawbacks. Due to the artificial material involved, people who receive these valves will need to take life-long blood-thinner medication (anticoagulants) to prevent clots from forming in the mechanical valve. These clots can increase the risk for a stroke. Also, some people report a valve ticking sound that is usually not bothersome. It is the sound of the valve leaflets opening and closing. Biological heart valves. The advantage of biological heart valves is that most people do not need to take life-long blood thinners, unless they have other conditions (such as atrial fibrillation) that warrant it. Biologic valves, traditionally, were not considered as durable as mechanical valves, especially in younger people. Previously available biologic valves usually needed to be replaced after about 10 years. However, some studies show that some biologic valves may last at least 17 years without decline in function. This represents a new milestone in the durability of biologic valves. Homograft heart valves. Homografts are ideal heart valves for aortic valve replacement, especially when the aortic root is diseased or there is infection. The heart's natural anatomy is preserved and patients do not need to take life-long blood thinners. However, the limited availability is a drawback in some settings."
Are There Non-Surgical Options for Valve Disease?,"'Yes. Balloon valvotomy is used to increase the opening of a narrowed (stenotic) heart valve. It is used for select patients who have mitral valve stenosis (narrowing of the mitral valve) with symptoms, select older people who have ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the aortic valve) but are not able to undergo surgery, and some patients with pulmonic stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonic valve).' "
What Happens During Balloon Valvotomy?,"'During a balloon valvotomy, a specially designed catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and guided to the heart. The tip is directed inside the narrowed heart valve. Once there, a tiny balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening. Once the cardiologist is satisfied the valve has been widened enough, the balloon is removed.''During the procedure, the cardiologist may perform an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound of the heart'') to get a better picture of the valve.''New research-based, non-surgical procedures to treat regurgitation (leaky valves) are being tested and may provide additional treatment options using a catheter for valve disease in the future.' "
What does meconium ileus mean?,"'Meconium ileus is an obstruction in the small intestine caused by thick, congealed meconium. Meconium is the first ''stool'' passed by a ''newborn'' baby. Meconium is made up of material such as ''mucus'', intestinal secretions, and ''amniotic fluid'' that the fetus ingests in the womb.''Meconium ileus may be of two forms:' Simple meconium ileus: Simple obstruction in the small intestines resulting in dilatation of the bowel above the obstruction, and bowel wall thickening. Complicated meconium ileus: Intestinal obstruction complicated by conditions such as intestinal twisting, perforation and infection."
Why is meconium ileus diagnostic for cystic fibrosis?,"'Meconium ileus is the earliest indication of ''cystic fibrosis'', though it may also occur in infants without cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease that affects the respiratory tract and pancreas.''Cystic fibrosis is a progressive disease caused by an ''inherited'' mutation in a gene known as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR gene encodes CFTR protein, which regulates the water content in the mucus membranes and keeps the mucus thin and free-flowing.''Meconium ileus may be diagnostic for cystic fibrosis if:''The three primary characteristics of cystic fibrosis are:' Ultrasonography reveals presence of meconium ileus in the fetus. Pancreas and intestinal tract appear to have abnormal development. The parents already have a child diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which establishes them as carriers of CFTR mutation. Chronic obstruction and infection of the respiratory tract: The mucus becomes thick and sticky, clogs the respiratory tract and causes infections. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: Pancreas is unable to produce the enzymes essential for digesting food. Elevated sweat chloride levels: Chloride is a component of salt, which moves in and out of cells to maintain water balance and electrical neutrality. Cystic fibrosis affects chloride movement in the sweat cells; consequently, its concentration in the sweat goes up."
What are the conditions associated with cystic fibrosis and meconium ileus?,"'In addition to persistent intestinal obstruction, complicated meconium ileus can lead to:''Other conditions associated with cystic fibrosis and meconium ileus include the following:' Volvulus (twisting of a loop of intestine) Atresia (malformation of intestine) Necrosis (tissue death) Perforation Meconium peritonitis (inflammation of peritoneum, the abdominal membrane) and pseudocyst formation from the spillage of meconium through the perforation Gastroesophageal reflux: Reflux is caused by distension of the stomach and slow gastric emptying because of intestinal obstruction. Biliary tract disease: Malabsorption of fats due to pancreatic insufficiency leads to biliary tract diseases such as:Bile duct obstructionGallstone formationBiliary dyskinesia (impaired bile flow)Sclerosing cholangitis (progressive disease of liver and gallbladder) Bile duct obstruction Gallstone formation Biliary dyskinesia (impaired bile flow) Sclerosing cholangitis (progressive disease of liver and gallbladder) Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome: Partial or complete obstruction in the lower part of the intestines by an impacted mass of fecal matter, which results in symptoms such as:VomitingAbdominal distensionCramping abdominal painPalpable mass most often in the lower right quadrant of the abdomenInfrequent bowel movements or complete constipation Vomiting Abdominal distension Cramping abdominal pain Palpable mass most often in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen Infrequent bowel movements or complete constipation Gastrointestinal neoplasms: Tumor growths in the gastrointestinal tract Fibrosing colonopathy: Narrowing of the colon, a complication from prolonged use of pancreatic enzymes as a treatment for cystic fibrosis. Symptoms include:Abdominal painPersistent or bloody diarrheaAbdominal distensionChylous ascites (collection of fatty lymph fluid in the abdomen) Abdominal pain Persistent or bloody diarrhea Abdominal distension Chylous ascites (collection of fatty lymph fluid in the abdomen) Rectal prolapse: Rectum slipping out of the anus due to:ConstipationColon distensionMalabsorption of fatsDiarrhea and frequent bowel movementsAbdominal pressure from coughing Constipation Colon distension Malabsorption of fats Diarrhea and frequent bowel movements Abdominal pressure from coughing"
How is meconium ileus treated?,"'A simple meconium ileus is most often treated with meglumine diatrizoate (''Gastrografin'') enema, a water-soluble substance that softens the meconium. Gastrografin also acts as a contrast medium for continuous X-ray (fluoroscopy) which can be used to confirm the evacuation of meconium.''Some cases of simple meconium may require surgery, while complicated meconium ileus always requires surgical intervention. Surgical treatments for meconium ileus involve removal (resection) of the affected part of the intestine and/or making an opening (''stoma'') through the abdomen to clear the meconium and irrigate the intestines.' "
What is the survival rate for babies with meconium ileus?,"'The survival rate for ''babies'' with meconium ileus has considerably increased because of improvement in''From a 33% to 50% survival rate in 1948, the survival rate for both simple and complicated meconium ileus has now improved to 85% to 100%. Children with cystic fibrosis and meconium ileus, however, are at a higher risk for:' Technology for diagnosing fetal cystic fibrosis Medical and surgical treatments for meconium ileus Nutritional support Treatment of bacterial infections Developing pulmonary issues such as mucus congestion and lung collapse (atelectasis) after eight to 10 years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial infection Shorter life span"
What is the medial collateral ligament (MCL)?,"'The knee joint allows the lower leg to flex (bend) or straighten (extend). To make certain that those are the only two motions that occur, there are four ligaments in the knee that help control and protect it.''Ligaments are tough bands of tissue that span a joint and attach to the bones on each side of it. The MCL is located on the inside of the knee (medial aspect) and is attached to the femur (thighbone) and tibia (shinbone). The MCL holds the knee stable when a valgus stress is placed on the outer part of the leg that could potentially buckle the knee toward the center of the body.''The muscles that surround the knee, especially the ''quadriceps'' muscles located in the front of the thigh, and the hamstrings located in the back of the thigh, are also important stabilizers of the knee joint.' The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is located on the medial aspect of the knee (medial = the closest to the center of the body) or inside of the knee. The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) is located on the lateral aspect of the knee (lateral = away from the center of the body) or outside of the knee. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) prevent anterior (frontward) and posterior (backward) movement of the knee joint."
What are the different types of medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries?,"'A sprain is an injury to a ligament. Like any other sprain, health care providers grade knee ligament injuries by their severity. A grade I sprain refers to when one stretches but does not tear the fibers of the ligament. MCL tears are grade II sprains if the ligament fibers are partially torn. MCL tears are a grade III sprain when the ligament is completely torn.''Because of the anatomy and how the MCL is related to the medial meniscus (cartilage) and the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament), these two structures may also be damaged in association with an MCL injury.' "
"What are causes and risk factors of medial collateral ligament (MCL) 
injuries?","'Medial collateral ligament injuries are the most common ligament sprains of the knee. They are also one of the common sports injuries and can occur in any age group. The most common risks include contact sports, including football, hockey, wrestling, and martial arts. Males tend to be more at risk than females.''MCL injuries occur usually from a sudden impact to the outer part of knee. The injury may be either due to contact, a blow to the outside part of the knee, or noncontact due to twisting, cutting, or stopping suddenly (deceleration).' "
What are medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury symptoms and signs?,"'Pain'' is the first symptom of an MCL ''knee injury''. It typically occurs almost immediately and is located along the course of the ligament. Sometimes this is associated with swelling within the knee joint. Occasionally, swelling develops in a matter of minutes. The ''knee pain'' of an MCL knee injury may also cause the person to limp in order to protect the knee joint.'  "
What tests diagnose and assess medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries?,"'The diagnosis of an MCL sprain is usually made by history and physical examination. The patient often knows the mechanism of the knee injury, that is precisely what they were doing and what position their body was in when the injury occurred. This helps the health-care professional understand the stresses that were put on the knee joint. Other questions might include whether the patient was able to walk, whether the knee began to swell, and how long it took for that to happen after the injury.''The physical examination includes looking at the knee to see whether or not it is swollen and touching the knee in various places to find places of tenderness and ''pain''. With MCL sprains, there is tenderness along the course of the ligament on the inner aspect of the knee.''The ligament can also be stressed on physical examination to determine whether the knee ligament is stable or whether there is joint laxity. By pushing on the outer side of the knee (reproducing the valgus stress that often causes the knee injury), the examiner can determine if the MCL is stable or unstable. This can be a rough assessment of the grade of sprain, where a grade I sprain is stable and a grade III sprain is unstable.''Physical examination concentrates on the knee joint and the hip and ankle to identify any other associated injuries.''There are other causes of inner (posteromedial and medial) ''knee pain''. One cause is inflammation of the anserinus bursa, where some of the hamstring muscles attach near the medial collateral ligament in the tibia. This bursa is one of the nearby the medial collateral ligament that may be inflamed and cause acute or ''chronic pain'' that can mimic an MCL injury.''Plain X-rays of the knee can identify ''fractures'' of the femur and tibia bones. An MRI is the best way to actually visualize the MCL and determine the grade of sprain, but it is not always necessary. If there is concern that there is also a tear of the medial meniscus or anterior cruciate ligament, an MRI may be appropriate.''If there has been ''chronic pain'' and inflammation, calcification along the insertion of the MCL into the femur can occur. This is referred to as a Pellegrini-Stieda lesion and usually causes no symptoms (asymptomatic). Less commonly, there can be associated pain and decreased knee range of motion that will require treatment.'  "
What is the treatment for a medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury?,"'MCL sprains tend to heal with rest and physical therapy to help return range of motion and strengthen the muscles that surround and protect the knee. While sports is a high-risk activity, may people injure their knees in their daily work and home routines. Primary care providers, orthopedic surgeons and sports medicine providers routinely assess and treat these patients. Physical therapists are often an important part of the treatment team.''Grade I and II sprains tend to heal within one to two weeks. The initial treatment often includes wearing a knee sleeve or hinged knee brace for comfort and protection and to increase range of motion and activity as tolerated. Patients will usually need crutches for a few days.''Health care providers usually treat grade III sprains similarly but forgo a knee sleeve for a hinged brace. Some health care professionals suggest immediate range of motion while others like to wait a few weeks before allowing the knee to move. Patients may return to play or work in six to eight weeks.' "
Is surgery required for medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries?,"'Historically, grade III MCL sprains were candidates for surgery, but more recently, doctors only consider surgery in patients where conservative (nonsurgical) treatment has failed.''Surgery is a primary treatment in patients who have also damaged their medial meniscus and/or their anterior cruciate ligament.'

Are there any home remedies for MCL injuries?,"'The initial treatment for an MCL sprain is the same as other sprains, including rest, ice, compression, and elevation. Because of the associated pain, using crutches to assist with ''walking'' is appropriate.''Anti-inflammatory medications like ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil'') or ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'') may be helpful for pain control. While these are ''over-the-counter'' medications, there may be reasons when this class of medications may not appropriate for a specific patient. It is wise to check with a health-care provider or pharmacist for any questions or concerns.' "
What are possible complications of medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries?,"'Instability is the major complication of a grade III MCL sprain. While avoiding surgery and undergoing physical therapy is the mainstay of treatment, there are some patients where the MCL remains unstable and the ligament loose and causes knee joint laxity. These patients often benefit from surgery to repair the MCL but only after initial nonsurgical therapy has failed.' "
What is the prognosis of a medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury? What is the recovery time for an MCL injury?,"'Most athletes with MCL injuries are able to return to play within a few weeks of injury. Those who have sustained grade I and II sprains can be competing within one to two weeks, while those with grade III sprains may need longer, about six to eight weeks to recover.' "
Is it possible to prevent a medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury?,"""It's not possible to prevent MCL sprains except by avoiding traumatic physical contact. They are the consequence of being active in a sport or because of an unexpected accident. In sports, there is controversy as to whether or not wearing a brace can help to protect the MCL."" "
Facts you should know about carpal tunnel syndrome,"   Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by irritation of the median nerve at the wrist. Any condition that exerts pressure on the median nerve can cause carpal tunnel syndrome. Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include numbness and tingling of the hand. Diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is suspected based on symptoms, supported by physical examination signs, and confirmed by nerve conduction testing. Treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome depends on the severity of symptoms and the underlying cause."
What is carpal tunnel syndrome?,"'Carpus'' is a word derived from the Greek word ''karpos'', which means ""wrist."" The wrist is surrounded by a band of fibrous tissue that normally functions as a support for the joint. The tight space between this fibrous band and the wrist bone is called the carpal tunnel. The median nerve passes through the carpal tunnel to receive sensations from the thumb, index, and middle fingers of the hand. Any condition that causes swelling or a change in position of the tissue within the carpal tunnel can squeeze and irritate the median nerve. Irritation of the median nerve in this manner causes tingling and numbness of the thumb, index, and the middle fingers -- a condition known as ""carpal tunnel syndrome.""' "
What conditions and diseases cause carpal tunnel syndrome?,"'For most patients, the cause of their carpal tunnel syndrome is unknown. Any condition that exerts pressure on the median nerve at the wrist can cause carpal tunnel syndrome. Common conditions that can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome include ''obesity'', ''pregnancy'', ''hypothyroidism'', ''arthritis'', ''diabetes'', and ''trauma''. Tendon inflammation resulting from repetitive work, such as uninterrupted typing, can also cause carpal tunnel symptoms. Carpal tunnel syndrome from repetitive maneuvers has been referred to as one of the ''repetitive stress injuries'', although this relationship remains controversial in the evidence based literature. Some rare diseases can cause deposition of abnormal substances in and around the carpal tunnel, leading to nerve irritation. These diseases include ''amyloidosis'', ''sarcoidosis'', ''multiple myeloma'', and ''leukemia''.'  "
What are carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms?,"'People with carpal tunnel syndrome initially feel numbness and tingling of the hand in the distribution of the median nerve (the thumb, index, middle, and thumb side of the ring fingers). These sensations are often more pronounced at night and can awaken people from ''sleep''. The reason symptoms are worse at night may be related to the flexed-wrist sleeping position and/or fluid accumulating around the wrist and hand while lying flat. Carpal tunnel syndrome may be a temporary condition that completely resolves or it can persist and progress.''As the disease progresses, patients can develop a burning sensation, and/or cramping and ''weakness'' of the hand. Decreased grip strength can lead to frequent dropping of objects from the hand. Occasionally, sharp shooting pains can be felt in the forearm. Chronic carpal tunnel syndrome can also lead to wasting (atrophy) of the hand muscles, particularly those near the base of the thumb in the palm of the hand.'  "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome?,"'The diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is suspected based on the symptoms and the distribution of the ''hand numbness'"". Examination of the neck, shoulder, elbow, pulses, and reflexes can be performed to exclude other conditions that can mimic carpal tunnel syndrome. The wrist can be examined for swelling, warmth, tenderness, deformity, and discoloration. Sometimes tapping the front of the wrist can reproduce tingling of the hand and is referred to as Tinel's sign of carpal tunnel syndrome. Symptoms can also at times be reproduced by the examiner by bending the wrist downward (referred to as Phalen's maneuver).""'The diagnosis is strongly suggested when a ''nerve conduction velocity test'' is abnormal. This test involves measuring the rate of speed of electrical impulses as they travel down a nerve. In carpal tunnel syndrome, the impulse slows as it crosses through the carpal tunnel. A test of muscles of the extremity, ''electromyogram'' (''EMG''), is sometimes performed with the nerve conduction velocity test to exclude or detect other conditions that might mimic carpal tunnel syndrome.''Blood tests may be performed to identify medical conditions associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. These tests include ''thyroid hormone'' levels, complete blood counts, and blood ''sugar'' and protein analysis. X-ray tests of the wrist and hand might also be helpful to identify abnormalities of the bones and joints of the wrist.'  "
What is the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome? Is it possible to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome?,"'The choice of treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome depends on the severity of the symptoms and any underlying disease that might be causing the symptoms.''Initial treatment usually includes rest, immobilization of the wrist in a splint, and occasionally ice application. Those whose occupations are aggravating the symptoms should modify their activities. For example, computer keyboards and chair height may need to be adjusted to optimize comfort. These measures, as well as periodic resting and range of motion stretching ''exercise'' of the wrists, can actually prevent the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome that are caused by repetitive overuse. Underlying conditions or diseases are treated individually. ''Fractures'' can require orthopedic management. ''Obese'' individuals will be advised regarding weight reduction. ''Rheumatoid disease'' is treated with measures directed against the underlying arthritis. Wrist swelling that can be associated with pregnancy resolves in time after delivery of the baby.''Several types of medications have been used in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Vitamin B6 (''pyridoxine'') has been reported to relieve some symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, although it is not known how this medication works. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' can also be helpful in decreasing inflammation and reducing ''pain''. Side effects include gastrointestinal upset and even ulceration of the stomach. These medications should be taken with food, and abdominal symptoms should be reported to the doctor. ''Corticosteroids'' can be given by mouth or injected directly into the involved wrist joint. They can bring rapid relief of the persistent symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. Side effects of these medications, when given in short courses, for carpal tunnel syndrome are minimal. However, corticosteroids can aggravate ''diabetes'' and should be avoided in the presence of infections.''Most patients with carpal tunnel syndrome improve with conservative measures and medications. Occasionally, chronic pressure on the median nerve can result in persistent numbness and weakness. In order to avoid serious and permanent nerve and muscle consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome, surgical treatment is considered. Surgery involves severing the band of tissue around the wrist to reduce pressure on the median nerve. This surgical procedure is called ""carpal tunnel release."" It can now be performed by microsurgery with a small diameter viewing tube, called an arthroscope, or by open wrist procedure. After carpal tunnel release, patients often undergo ''exercise'' rehabilitation. Though it is uncommon, symptoms can recur.'  "
What are complications of carpal tunnel syndrome?,'Complications of carpal tunnel syndrome are uncommon but include atrophy and weakness of the muscles at the base of the thumb in the palm of the hand. This can be a permanent complication if not corrected early enough. This can lead to lack of dexterity of the affected fingers.' 
What is the prognosis for carpal tunnel syndrome?,"'The outlook is generally excellent as carpal tunnel syndrome usually responds to the conservative measures reviewed above. Sometimes surgical operation is necessary, and residual weakness can occur.' "
Which specialists are involved in the care of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome?,"'Carpal tunnel syndrome can be evaluated and treated by general physicians, including family practitioners, general practitioners, internists, as well as by orthopedists, ''rheumatologists'', neurologists, and physiatrists.' "

Introduction,'You have been informed by your healthcare provider that you will need to receive intravenous (IV) infusions of a medication to treat your health condition. ''The treatment for many conditions relies on medications administered by IV infusion therapy.' 
How do I prepare for the infusion?,"'Below are a few helpful suggestions to help you create a pleasant and healing experience. ''Check with your healthcare practitioner or the staff at the infusion center for any pre-infusion instructions. Some examples may include: '   The first and most important step is to replace confusion with confidence.  Make a list of questions that pertain to your health condition or questions about your medication and infusion to review with your healthcare practitioner. It may be necessary to make an appointment to review all of your questions.  Learn about the infused medication. There are many places to obtain information about your medication. Discuss the medication(s) with your doctor. Pharmaceutical companies often provide information in the offices and on the Internet for patients and their families. There may also be medical books written about your medication or health condition.  Visit the Infusion Center and meet the medical staff before your first infusion.  Drink plenty of water to be sure you are well hydrated. If you have a heart condition, kidney condition or any other health condition that prevents you from drinking large amounts of fluid, check with your healthcare practitioner for instructions on how to hydrate before your infusion procedure. Some infusions may require that you pre-medicate with medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol). Check with the infusion staff regarding any pre-medications you need to take prior to your infusion, the dose, and the best time to take the medications.  Wear comfortable loose fitting clothes. You will want to be comfortable, and most likely your vital signs will monitored (for example, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate (breathing rate), or a cardiac monitor may be attached to your chest). Every infusion center is different, so check with yours in regard to what to expect. Wearing loose fitting clothes allows the medical staff to easily and properly monitor your vital signs.  Consider wearing clothing with layers to allow for temperature control. The temperature of the infusion center may be cool or warm; also some intravenous infusions can make you feel either warm or cool. Having layers of clothing allows you the flexibility to easily control your comfort zone.  Most infusion centers will provide blankets, pillows, water and coffee. Check to see what the center provides in case they do not offer something that will make you more comfortable.  Do not wear any fragrance or perfume, other patients may be allergic. Bring a complete list of current medications, allergies, and emergency contact information for the infusion staff to add to your chart."
What are some things I can do to pass the time while receiving therapy?,"'Things to take or do:''PLEASE DO NOT TALK ON YOUR CELL PHONE'' - Place your phone on vibrate mode or turn it off. This is not a time for talking on the phone (unless you have an OK from the infusion staff).''Arrive at the infusion center with a:'  Book Magazine Newspaper Crossword puzzle or Suduko game Hand held games - (if they are quiet or have headphones) Bring your own music (I-pod or MP3 player) A neck pillow - the type used on airplanes Pictures of your family or loved ones Study for that upcoming test Bring your computer and get some work done, watch a movie, or play games. Snacks and a drink (if allowed in the infusion room) Bring paper and pen - make a list of things you need to do Write a letter -a letter of encouragement - of love - of thanks. Catch up on paper work Plan a party Make your shopping list Knit Crochet Draw or doodle Plan a trip Take a nap Pray Meditate Smile Positive attitude (you are in good hands). Personal affirmation - Find one that feels good and energizes you. For example: ""I have the perfect medicine...at the perfect time...I am healing."" Sit back and relax"
What happens during and after the infusion?,"'Be confident that you are receiving excellent care!' Ask questions and notify the staff immediately if you are not feeling ""right"" or have a concern.  Consider talking with someone in the Infusion Center receiving treatment. They may have some advice about their health condition that will help you. You may meet a new friend.  After your infusion is completed, ask for any important post infusion instructions. You may need to take post-infusion medications. Check with your healthcare practitioner or the infusion staff for detailed instructions.  A dressing will be placed in the area where your infusion was done. This dressing should be kept in place for at least 30 minutes or longer. If you are on a blood thinner, leave the dressing in place longer to avoid any bleeding. Check with the staff at the Infusion Center in regard to the length of time necessary to keep the dressing in place.  If you have an allergy to tape, inform the infusion staff (advise them of all allergies).  Obtain a phone number to call in the event that you have any questions or possible side effects to the medication you receive (such as a fever or rash) after your infusion has been completed. "

What is cholesterol?,"   Cholesterol is a chemical compound that is naturally produced by the body and is structurally a combination of fat (lipid) and steroid. Cholesterol is a building block for cell membranes and for hormones, for example, estrogen and testosterone. The liver produces about 80% of the body's cholesterol, while the rest comes from our diet. The main sources of dietary cholesterol are meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products. Organ meats, such as liver, are especially high in cholesterol content, while foods of plant origin contain no cholesterol. After a meal, dietary cholesterol is absorbed from the intestine and stored in the liver. The liver is able to regulate cholesterol levels in the bloodstream and can secrete cholesterol if the body needs it."
"What are ""normal"" cholesterol blood levels?","'There are no established ""normal"" blood levels for total and LDL cholesterol. In most other blood tests in medicine, normal ranges can be set by taking measurements from large number of healthy subjects. The normal range of LDL cholesterol among ""healthy"" adults (adults with no known coronary ''heart disease'') in the United States may be too high. The atherosclerosis process may be quietly progressing in many healthy children and adults with average LDL cholesterol blood levels, putting them at risk of developing coronary ''heart disease'' in the future.' "
What are HDL cholesterol (good) vs. LDL cholesterol (bad)? What do they do?," LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein) is called ""bad"" cholesterol because elevated levels of LDL cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. LDL lipoprotein deposits cholesterol along the inside of artery walls, causing the formation of a hard, thick substance called cholesterol plaque. Over time, cholesterol plaque causes thickening of the artery walls and narrowing of the lumen of the arteries, a process called atherosclerosis, which decreases blood flow through the narrowed plaque-filled vessel. Narrowing of blood vessels in the heart may lead to angina (a type of chest pain) or heart attack. Narrowing of blood vessels in the brain may cause a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. Narrowing of the arteries throughout the body (peripheral artery disease) can lead to signs and symptoms of pain, including in the intestine (mesenteric ischemia) and in the legs with walking (claudication). HDL cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein) is called the ""good cholesterol"" because HDL cholesterol particles prevent atherosclerosis by extracting cholesterol from the artery walls and disposing of them through the liver. High levels of LDL cholesterol and low levels of HDL cholesterol (high LDL/HDL ratios) are risk factors for atherosclerosis and heart attacks Low levels of LDL cholesterol and high levels of HDL cholesterol (low LDL/HDL ratios) are desirable and protect against heart disease and stroke. Very low and very high HDL cholesterol levels can run in families. Families with low HDL cholesterol levels have a higher incidence of heart attacks than the general population, while families with high HDL cholesterol levels tend to live longer with a lower frequency of heart attacks. LDL cholesterol, lifestyle factors, and other conditions influence HDL cholesterol levels. HDL cholesterol levels tend to be lower in persons who smoke cigarettes or have type 2 diabetes and in those who are overweight or inactive. HDL cholesterol is higher in people who are lean, exercise regularly, and do not smoke cigarettes. Estrogen increases a person's HDL cholesterol, which explains why women generally have higher HDL levels than men do. The combination of low levels of total and LDL cholesterol and high levels of HDL cholesterol is favorable. Total cholesterol is the sum of LDL (low-density) cholesterol, HDL (high-density) cholesterol, VLDL (very low-density) cholesterol, and IDL (intermediate density) cholesterol. The liver manufactures and secretes LDL cholesterol into the blood. It also removes LDL cholesterol from the blood by active LDL receptors on the surface of its cells. A decrease in the number of liver cell LDL receptors is associated with high LDL cholesterol blood levels. Both heredity and diet have a significant influence on a person's LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol levels. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (an inherited form of very high cholesterol in the blood) is a disorder in which patients have a diminished number or nonexistent LDL receptors on the surface of liver cells. People with this disorder also tend to develop atherosclerosis and heart attacks during early adulthood. Diets that are high in saturated fats and cholesterol raise the levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood. Fats are classified as saturated or unsaturated (according to their chemical structure). Saturated fats are derived primarily from meat and dairy products and can raise blood cholesterol levels. Some vegetable oils made from coconut, palm, and cocoa are high in saturated fats."
What are the cholesterol guidelines to prevent heart attack and stroke,"'The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association have guidelines to help health-care professionals counsel patients on how to decrease the risk of suffering a heart attack or ''stroke''. Since it takes years for cholesterol plaque to narrow arteries enough to cause blood flow problems, there is opportunity to intervene early to stop the progression of this narrowing.''In addition to controlling cholesterol, the guidelines ''stress'' lifelong control of ''high blood pressure'' and ''diabetes'', and the new guidelines ''stress'':''The previous goal of maintaining ""normal"" cholesterol levels has been replaced by an approach that suggests more people may benefit from cholesterol-lowering statin medications, and not just those with ''high cholesterol'' levels. These four groups include patients:'""The goal for statin therapy is to decrease the LDL blood levels. In patients' prescribed high intensity statin therapy, the goal is to lower LDL levels by 50%. For those who have medium intensity statin therapy, the goal is a LDL reduction of 30% to 50%."" Weight control Diet Exercise Mandatory smoking cessation With known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) With LDL cholesterol levels (the ""bad"" cholesterol) higher than 190 mg/dL With diabetes and without ASCVD, aged 40-75 whose LDL cholesterol is between 70-189 mg/dL Without diabetes or ASCVD with a 10-year risk of developing heart disease that is greater than 7.5%. An online calculator from the American Heart Association may be used to help predict this risk"
What are LDL/HDL and total/HDL ranges and ratios?,"'The'' total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio (total chol/HDL) ''is a number helpful in estimating the risk of developing atherosclerosis. The number is obtained by dividing total cholesterol by HDL cholesterol. (High ratios indicate a higher risk of ''heart attacks'', whereas low ratios indicate a lower risk).''High total cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol increases the ratio and is undesirable. Conversely, high HDL cholesterol and low total cholesterol lowers the ratio and is desirable. Ideally, one should strive for ratios of 2 or 3 (less than 4).' "
How can levels of HDL cholesterol be increased?," The first step in increasing HDL cholesterol levels (and decreasing LDL/HDL ratios) is by implementing and maintaining therapeutic life style changes. Regular aerobic exercise, loss of excess weight (fat), and smoking cessation will increase HDL cholesterol levels. Regular alcohol consumption in moderation (such as one drink a day) will also raise HDL cholesterol. Because of other adverse health consequences of excessive alcohol consumption, alcohol is not recommended as a standard treatment for low HDL cholesterol."
"How can high LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol levels be lowered?","'“It must be emphasized that lifestyle modification (i.e., adhering to a heart healthy ''diet'', regular ''exercise'' habits, avoidance of tobacco products, and maintenance of a healthy weight) remains a critical component of health promotion and ASCVD risk reduction, both prior to and in concert with the use of cholesterol-lowering drug therapies.”''- 2013 ''ACC''/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults''Newer medications, PCSK9 protein antibodies, Alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha) are potentially useful in treating certain patients where diet and ''statins'' have failed to adequately lower LDL level.'   Therapeutic lifestyle changes to lower LDL cholesterol can help lower and maintain levels naturally. This may involve:Excess weight lossGetting regular exerciseEating a heart healthy diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol Excess weight loss Getting regular exercise Eating a heart healthy diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol Medications to lower cholesterol: Medications are prescribed when lifestyle changes cannot reduce the LDL cholesterol to desired levels. The most effective and widely used medications to lower LDL cholesterol are called statins. Research has shown that only these statin drugs have a proven benefit to decrease the risk of heart attack and stroke. Other medications prescribed to lower cholesterol profiles include fibrates such as gemfibrozil (Lopid), resins such as cholestyramine (Questran), and ezetimibe (Zetia)."
14 Foods that help lower cholesterol levels,"'A healthy diet that minimizes cholesterol intake is a good first step in using food to decrease cholesterol levels in the blood. Extra lean meats, skim milk, and vegetable-based ""butter-like"" substitutes may help decrease LDL levels in the bloodstream.''In addition to diet, exercise, and ''weight loss'', there are foods that may help in lowering and rebalancing the cholesterol -- increasing HDL (the good) and decreasing LDL (the bad).''Increasing soluble ''fiber'' in the diet helps decrease both total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Sources include:''Nuts are healthy. Nuts that may be helpful in ''lowering cholesterol'' levels include:''However, nuts are high in calories and should be eaten in moderation. Avoid nuts covered with salt or ''sugar''.' Oatmeal Oat bran Avariety of vegetables and fruits, for example, apples, pears, and prunes The goal for consumption of dietary fiber is 5 to 10 grams of soluble fiber a day (a cup of oatmeal has 4 grams of fiber and an apple contains 3 grams). Olive oil acts as an antioxidant to decrease LDL levels and does not affect levels of good HDL cholesterol. Foods fortified with plant sterols and stanols decrease cholesterol absorption in the intestine. They can be found in cereal, margarines, and yogurts. Read labels to discover which foods are fortified with these beneficial plant compounds. Sterols and stanols may also be found as a dietary supplement. Soy and foods containing soy products may help decrease LDL levels. Almonds Hazelnuts Peanuts Pecans Pine nuts Pistachios Walnuts Certain fish contain omega-3 fatty acids that lower cholesterol levels. The American Heart Association recommends at least 2 to 3 servings per week in the diet. Fatty fish that are helpful include salmon, halibut, mackerel, trout, herring, and sardines. It's best to grill or bake fish and to avoid frying."
"What medications lower cholesterol, lipids, and triglycerides?","'Lipid-altering medications are used to lower blood levels of undesirable ''lipids'' such as LDL cholesterol and ''triglycerides'' and increase blood levels of desirable ''lipids'' such as HDL cholesterol. Several classes of medications are available in the United States, including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), nicotinic acid, fibric acid derivatives, and medications that decrease intestinal cholesterol absorption (''bile acid sequestrants'' and cholesterol absorption inhibitors). Some of these medications are primarily useful in lowering LDL cholesterol, others in lowering ''triglycerides'', and some in elevating HDL cholesterol. Medications also can be combined to more aggressively lower LDL, as well as lower LDL and increase HDL at the same time.''Newer medications, alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha) have been approved to help lower LDL levels in certain pateints where diet and other statin medications have not worked adequately.''Note: Dosing guidelines change. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a guideline concerning the potential dangers of taking the 80 mg dose of ''simvastatin'' (''Zocor'').'  "
Is lowering LDL cholesterol enough?,"'The reduction of LDL cholesterol is only part of the battle against atherosclerosis. Individuals who have normal or only mildly elevated LDL cholesterol levels can still develop atherosclerosis and heart attacks even in the absence of other risk factors such as ''cigarette smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', and ''diabetes''.' "
Does lowering LDL cholesterol prevent heart attacks and strokes?,"'The benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol are:''The same measures that decrease narrowing in coronary arteries also may benefit the large arteries in the neck and brain (carotid and cerebral arteries) as well as the femoral arteries that supply blood to the legs and the arteries that supply blood to the intestine.' Reduces or stops the formation of new cholesterol plaques on the artery walls Reduces existing cholesterol plaques on the artery walls and widening the arteries Prevents the rupture of cholesterol plaques, which initiates blood clot formation and blocks blood vessels causing heart attack or stroke Decreases the risk of heart attacks Decreases the risk of strokes Decreases the risk of peripheral artery disease"
What are triglycerides and VLDL?,"'Triglyceride is a fatty substance that is composed of three fatty acids. Like cholesterol, triglyceride in the blood comes either from the diet or the liver. In addition, like cholesterol, triglyceride cannot dissolve and circulate in the blood without combining with a lipoprotein.''The liver removes triglyceride from the blood and it synthesizes and packages triglyceride into VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) particles and releases them back into the blood circulation.' "
What causes elevated triglyceride levels?,"'High triglyceride blood levels (hypertriglyceridemia) may be genetic or they may be acquired. Examples of ''inherited'' hypertriglyceridemia disorders include mixed hypertriglyceridemia, familial hypertriglyceridemia, and familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.''Hypertriglyceridemia can often be caused by nongenetic factors such as ''obesity'', excessive alcohol intake, ''diabetes mellitus'', ''kidney disease'', and estrogen-containing medications such as ''birth control pills''.' "
Do high triglyceride levels cause atherosclerosis?,"'Whether elevated ''triglyceride levels'' in the blood lead to atherosclerosis and heart attacks is controversial. While abnormally high ''triglyceride levels'' may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis, it is difficult to conclusively prove that elevated triglyceride by itself can cause atherosclerosis. Elevated ''triglyceride levels'' are often associated with other conditions that increase the risk of atherosclerosis including ''obesity''; low levels of HDL cholesterol; ''insulin resistance''; poorly-controlled ''diabetes''; and small, dense LDL cholesterol particles.' "
How can elevated blood triglyceride levels be treated?,"'Diet is the first step in treating hypertriglyceridemia. A low-fat diet, regular ''aerobic exercise'', loss of excess weight, reduction of alcohol consumption, and stopping ''cigarette smoking'' may be enough to control ''triglyceride levels'' in the blood. In patients with diabetes, meticulous control of elevated blood glucose is also important. This can be monitored by measuring the hemoblobin A1c levels in the blood.''When medications are necessary, ''fibrates'' (such as ''gemfibrozil'' [''Lopid'']), nicotinic acid, and statin medications can be used. Lopid not only decreases triglyceride levels but also increases HDL cholesterol levels and LDL cholesterol particle size. Nicotinic acid lowers triglyceride levels and increases HDL cholesterol levels and the size of LDL cholesterol particles.''Statins are effective for decreasing triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels and, to a lesser extent, elevating HDL cholesterol levels.'  "
What are the types of oral diabetes medications?,"'Oral ''diabetes medications'' are used to improve blood ''sugar'' (glucose) control in patients with ''type 2 diabetes''.''Currently, there are nine drug classes of oral ''diabetes'' medications approved for the treatment of ''type 2 diabetes''.''These medications differ in the way they function in the body to reduce blood glucose.''Metformin'' (''Glucophage'') is the only biguanide available in the United States and is generally the first choice for oral treatment of type 2 ''diabetes mellitus''. Metformin improves''Sulfonylureas are the oldest classes of oral ''diabetes'' medications. Sulfonylureas work primarily by stimulating the release of insulin. Insulin is the hormone responsible for regulating blood glucose by increasing the uptake of blood glucose by tissues and increasing the storage of glucose in the liver.''Meglitinides and sulfonylureas have a similar mechanism of action. Meglitinides are short-acting glucose-lowering medications. They stimulate the secretion of insulin from the pancreas.''Thiazolidinediones enhance insulin sensitivity meaning that the effect of a given amount of insulin is greater. Thiazolidinediones also are referred to as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? or PPAR-? agonists.''α-glucosidase inhibitors delay the ''digestion'' and absorption of starch or carbohydrates by inhibiting enzymes in the small intestine which help breakdown these molecules. The starches and carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which then is absorbed from the intestine and increases the level in the blood.''DPP-4 inhibitors help lower blood glucose by increasing the production of insulin from the pancreas and reducing the release of glucose from the liver.''SGLT2 inhibitors'' or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are the newest class of oral ''diabetes'' medications. They work by reducing the absorption of glucose from the fluid that is filtered from the blood by the kidney, causing more glucose to be eliminated in the urine. These medications increase urinary glucose excretion and consequently lower blood ''sugar'' levels.''Currently, the only bile acid sequestrant approved for the oral treatment of ''type 2 diabetes'' is ''colesevelam'' (''Welchol''). Bile acid sequestrants function primarily in the intestines where they bind to and decrease the reabsorption of bile acid. The exact mechanism by which these agents lower blood glucose is not known.''Bromocriptine'' (Cycloset) is a dopamine agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The exact mechanism whereby bromocriptine lowers blood glucose is not known.'   α-glucosidase inhibitors Biguanides Sulfonylureas Meglitinides Thiazolidinediones DPP-4 inhibitors Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors Dopamine agonists Bile acid sequestrants the body's response to natural insulin, decreases the absorption of glucose from the intestines, and reduces the production of glucose by the liver."
What are examples of oral diabetes medications available in the US?,"'Sulfonylureas are grouped into two classes, first and second generation agents.''First generation sulfonylureas include''Second generation sulfonylureas are''The only biguanide available in the United States is metformin (Glucophage, Glucophage XR, ''Riomet'').''Thiazolidinediones or TZDs include''Currently the only bile acid sequestrant approved for the oral treatment of type 2 diabetes is colesevelam (Welchol).''Bromocriptine mesylate (Cycloset) is a dopamine agonist.' acarbose (Precose), and miglitol (Glyset). acetohexamide (Dymelor), chlorpropamide (Diabinese), tolazamide (Tolinase), and tolbutamide (Orinase). glimepiride (Amaryl), glipizide (Glucotrol, Glucotrol XL), and glyburide (DiaBeta, Micronase). pioglitazone (Actos), and rosiglitazone (Avandia). nateglinide (Starlix) and repaglinide (Prandin) sitagliptin (Januvia) saxagliptin (Onglyza) linagliptin (Tradjenta) alogliptin (Nesina) empagliflozin (Jardiance), canagliflozin (Invokana), and dapagliflozin (Farxiga)."

What are the side effects of oral diabetes medications?,'The nine classes of oral diabetes ''drugs'' differ in their side effect profile. The main side effects of each class are as listed.' 
Side effects of thiazolidinediones,"'Thiazolidinediones may cause' liver disease, fluid retention, weight gain, increased risk for fractures, increased risk for bladder cancer, and increased risk for ovulation which may result in pregnancies."
Side effects of DPP-4 inhibitors,"'Although DPP-4 inhibitors are generally well tolerated, they may cause' hypoglycemia, headache, nasopharyngitis, fluid retention, hives, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and facial swelling."
Side effects of biguanides (metformin [Glucophage]),"'The most common side effects of metformin include''These side effects usually are mild and tend to decrease in severity over time despite continuation of treatment.''Other reported side effects of metformin include''Although rare, metformin may cause lactic acidosis, a serious condition that occurs due to the accumulation of acid in the body.' stomach discomfort, upset stomach, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. metallic taste, interference with vitamin B12 absorption, and exercise induced hypoglycemia."
Side effects of sulfonylureas,"'Sulfonylureas most commonly cause hypoglycemia (''low blood glucose'') and weight gain. Less common side effects are' skin rash, drop in red blood cell count, liver disease, and upset stomach."
Side effects of meglitinides,'The most common side effects of meglitinides are hypoglycemia and weight gain. The risk for hypoglycemia and weight gain appears to be low in comparison to sulfonylureas.' 
Side effects of α-glucosidase,"'α-glucosidase inhibitors most commonly cause' gas, bloating, upset stomach, and diarrhea."
Side effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors,"'The most common side effects associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors include''Other reported side effects' vaginal yeast infections, yeast infections of the penis, Upper respiratory tract infections, UTIs, and changes in urination (urinary urgency, urinating more often and in larger amount). Hypotension (decrease in blood pressure) Kidney dysfunction Dehydration Hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or drugs that increase insulin secretion Increase in cholesterol Bladder cancer Hypersensitivity reactions"
Side effects of bile acid sequestrants,"'The most common side effects of bile acid sequestrants include:''Colesevelam also may cause an increase in ''triglyceride levels''.' stomach discomfort or pain, constipation, and heartburn."
Side effects of bromocriptine mesylate (Cycloset),"'Side effects associated with bromocriptine therapy include:\\' nausea, runny nose, headache, weakness, dizziness, constipation, and sinusitis."
What drugs interact with oral diabetes medications?,"'Drug interactions'' with oral diabetes drugs vary based on individual diabetes drug classes. However, drugs which cause blood glucose levels to increase may diminish the effectiveness of any oral diabetes drug therapy. Examples of drugs which increase blood glucose include''Metformin is eliminated from the body via the kidneys in a process known as renal tubular secretion. Drugs which are also eliminated via this same pathway may compete with metformin for elimination when administered concomitantly and increase the risk of metformin associated side effects due to an increase in blood levels of metformin. Examples of such drugs include'""Due to the risk of lactic acidosis metformin containing products must be temporarily discontinued prior to the administration of radiopaque contrast dyes. Metformin should be held for at least 48 hours after contrast dye administration and should not be restarted until the patient's kidney function returns back to normal."" thiazide diuretics, other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid medications, estrogens, birth control pills, phenytoin (Dilantin), nicotinic acid, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and isoniazid (Nydrazid). amiloride (Midamor), digoxin (Lanoxin), morphine, procainamide (Procanbid), quinidine (Quin-Tab), quinine (Qualaquin), ranitidine (Zantac), triamterene (Dyrenium), trimethoprim (Primsol), dofetilide (Tikosyn), and vancomycin (Vancocin). Sulfonylureas are broken down (metabolized) by a set of liver enzymes. Medications which inhibit or induce the activity of these enzymes may impact their blood levels. Gemfibrozil (Lopid) strongly inhibits the breakdown of repaglinide and consequently may cause prolonged hypoglycemia. Thiazolidinediones may interact with drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of liver certain enzymes known as CYP3A4, CYP2C8, or CYP2C9. The dose of pioglitazone must be limited to 15 mg when administered in combination with gemfibrozil (Lopid), a strong inhibitor of these pathways. DPP-4 inhibitors are metabolized extensively by liver enzymes. Therefore, drug-drug interactions are possible with agents that alter the function of these enzymes. The effectiveness of meglitinides may be reduced when administered with carbohydrate digesting enzymes such as amylase, pancreatin, or pancrelipase. Bile acid sequestrants have many drug interactions. Bile acid sequestrants decrease the absorption of levothyroxine (Synthroid), glyburide (DiaBeta, Micronase), and birth control pills when administered together. Additionally, they may also decrease the absorption of other drugs such as warfarin (Coumadin), digoxin (Lanoxin), and fat-soluble vitamins (Vitamins A, D, E, and K). Therefore, these agents should be administered at least 4 hours before the dose of colesevelam. Bromocriptine is metabolized by CYP3A4 liver enzymes. Drugs which alter the activity of these enzymes may change bromocriptine levels in the blood and consequently cause adverse effects. Bromocriptine may also interact with some antipsychotics and ergot based migraine medications."
What formulations of oral diabetes medications are available?, All oral diabetes drugs are available in tablet forms. Glipizide and metformin are available as extended-release tablets. Metformin also is available in an oral liquid form. Colesevelam is available as an oral powder for suspension.
"What about taking oral diabetes medications during pregnancy or while 
breastfeeding?","'Use of oral diabetes drugs during ''pregnancy'' is controversial. For most women, the first step to maintaining optimal blood glucose control during pregnancy is to make appropriate lifestyle and dietary changes. Insulin therapy is the preferred treatment of ''pregnant'' women with ''gestational diabetes'' or type 2 diabetes who fail to achieve adequate blood glucose control with dietary or lifestyle (for example, ''exercise'', weight reduction) changes alone.''With the exception of glyburide, all sulfonylureas are classified as FDA pregnancy risk category C (risk not ruled out).''Oral diabetes drugs can enter the ''breast milk'' and can cause hypoglycemia in the ''newborn''. Therefore, careful risk and benefit analysis should be made for each mother and her infant before a decision is made. Use of oral diabetes medications in ''nursing'' mothers should be avoided if possible.' Meglitinides, TZDs also are classified as FDA pregnancy risk category C. Glyburide, metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, α-glucosidase inhibitors, colesevelam, and bromocriptine are categorized as pregnancy risk category B (no risk in animal studies). To prevent fetal harm, use of oral diabetes medications should be avoided during pregnancy if possible."
What is brucellosis?,"'Brucellosis is in infectious disease caused by bacteria in the genus ''Brucella''. ''Brucella'' are aerobic, gram-negative coccobacilli. Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection (meaning the disease occurs mainly in animals but is occasionally transferred to humans). Brucellosis has been known by various names such as Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, undulant ''fever'"", Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and gastric remittent fever. Brucellosis is found in North-American wild animals (elk, bison) and is occasionally found in domesticated animals (cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats). The major species of the genus ""'Brucella'' that cause the disease are ''B. melitensis'', ''B. suis'', ''B. abortus'', and ''B. canis''; these are associated with sheep, pigs, cattle, and ''dogs'' respectively. The most pathogenic (likely to cause disease) species are ''B. melitensis'' and ''B. suis''.' "
What is the history of brucellosis?,"'Brucellosis was thought to be first described by Hippocrates and the Romans more than 2,000 years ago. In 1887, Dr. David Bruce isolated the organisms from patients who were living on the island of Malta (hence the name Malta fever). The disease was eventually named after Dr. Bruce (brucellosis). The disease has been found worldwide, and high-risk areas include the Mediterranean countries, South and Central America, Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and the Caribbean. Fortunately, there are only about 100-200 people infected per year in the United States. California and Texas have the highest infection rates.''Strains of highly pathogenic ''Brucella'' have been considered to be used as a biological weapon because the organisms can be aerosolized and then easily inhaled.' "
What are causes of brucellosis?,"'The cause of brucellosis is bacterial. ''Brucella'' bacteria can enter the ''human body'' through mucous membranes, breaks in the skin, the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and even the ''conjunctiva'"". Unfortunately, these organisms can survive reasonably well within the body's cells, including different types of cells. These bacteria can be transported within the human cells via the lymphatic system or in the bloodstream to other organs. Any organ system can be involved, and both localized and systemic (body-wide) infections may occur. The bacteria can also replicate inside host cells and then be released when the cell dies. These bacteria go on to spread the infection to other human cells."" "
What are risk factors for brucellosis?,"'Risk factors for brucellosis include consuming unpasteurized milk or cheese, eating poorly cooked or raw meats, or associating with wild animals that may harbor the organisms (hunters, for example). Veterinarians, sheepherders, hunters, and others associated with animal processing and farming are at increased risk.' "
Is brucellosis contagious? How long is brucellosis contagious?,"'According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), brucellosis is only weakly ''contagious'' because person-to-person spread of brucellosis is rare. Unfortunately, people can easily get the disease from eating or drinking unpasteurized or raw dairy products and can even become infected by inhaling aerosolized bacteria or become infected through breaks in the skin or mucous membranes.''Brucellosis is contagious as long as living bacteria are present in domestic and wild animals and/or their secretions, including milk products. In addition, the bacteria have been documented to survive in the environment for up to two years under favorable conditions (darkness, cold temperatures, and relatively high CO2 concentrations) and still cause disease.' "
What is the incubation period for brucellosis?,"'The incubation period (time between infection and the development of the disease) for brucellosis is considered to be highly variable, with a range of five days to five months, with a few patients reporting incubation periods as long as a year; the average incubation period is about two to four weeks.' "
How is brucellosis transmitted to humans?,"'The most common way individuals become infected with brucellosis is by eating or drinking unpasteurized or raw dairy products. If animals like sheep, goats, cows, or camels are infected with ''Brucella'', the milk they produce is contaminated with the bacteria. Another way that brucellosis spreads to humans is by inhalation of the bacteria. Although this risk is generally associated with people who work in laboratories studying ''Brucella'' organisms, it is possible that people working in meat-processing areas could be exposed to the bacteria by inhalation of droplets from contaminated meat (cattle, sheep). The bacteria can also infect humans through breaks in the skin or through the mucous membranes. Commonly infected animals that are hunted that may contain ''Brucella'' are caribou, moose, wild hogs (feral hogs), elk, and bison. Person-to-person transmission of brucellosis is rare but may occur during sex, blood transfusions, transplacental transfer, or even in contact with menstrual blood.' "
What are symptoms and signs of brucellosis?,"'Brucellosis can cause a wide range of symptoms. Some symptoms appear early while others may develop over a long time period. Initial or early symptoms may include''Over time, the fevers may become recurrent with ''night sweats'', ''joint pain'' may worsen, and organ swelling may occur in the heart, testicles, ''liver'', and/or spleen, resulting in decreased functioning of these organs. Some people will develop a skin ''rash'' and/or micro-abscesses (subcutaneous granulomas) in the skin. In addition, patients may have ''chronic fatigue'', ''depression'', and neurologic symptoms. It takes about two to four weeks (latent period) after initial exposure for most people to start showing symptoms.'   fever, fatigue, sweating, pain in the muscles, joints, and/or abdomen, pain in the back, loss of appetite, weight loss, cough, headache, and/or swollen lymph nodes."
What specialists treat brucellosis?,"""Although the patient's primary-care provider (including internists and family practitioners) can treat brucellosis, it is not unusual to consult infectious-disease specialists, neurologists, rheumatologists, and specialists in ""'travel medicine'' about treatment and/or prevention of this disease. In severe infections, other specialists may be consulted (for example, urologists, obstetrician-gynecologists [for infected ''pregnant'' patients]) depending on the organ system most altered.' "
How do physicians diagnose brucellosis?,"""Brucellosis is diagnosed preliminarily by the patient's history of exposure to likely sources of ""'Brucella'"" bacteria and the patient's clinical symptoms. Confirmation of the diagnosis is made by culturing ""'Brucella'"" bacteria from the patient. In addition, there are serological tests for the organisms done on the patient's blood specimens. These tests look for IgM or IgG antibodies directed against the bacteria. However, the CDC recommends that these tests be confirmed by a ""'Brucella''-specific agglutination test, a specific test that is usually run by a specialty laboratory. These tests help differentiate brucellosis from ''leptospirosis'', ''malaria'', ''tularemia'', and other diseases that may produce similar symptoms.' "
What are brucellosis treatments?,"""According to the CDC, doxycycline (Vibramycin, Oracea, Adoxa, Atridox) and rifampin (Rifadin) are the recommended antibiotics, taken in combination, for a minimum of six to eight weeks to treat infected patients. This long treatment time is due to the organism's ability to survive inside human cells; consequently, the CDC recommends that a firm diagnosis be established before long-term antibiotic treatment is begun. Individuals who are immunosuppressed and pregnant patients, in most cases, should be treated in consultation with an infectious-disease specialist."" "
Are there home remedies for brucellosis?,"'There are many home remedies listed on the Internet for brucellosis. A few examples include colloidal silver, ''garlic'', a spice termed ''Origanum syriacum'', mixtures of essential oils, and many others. Scientific evidence is lacking about the effectiveness of these remedies. Patients should discuss with their doctors any remedies before using them.' "
What is the prognosis of brucellosis?,"'In general, the prognosis for patients infected with ''Brucella'"" is very good. If individuals are treated appropriately within the first few months of symptom onset, they are curable with antibiotics and usually don't develop chronic disease. The symptoms usually improve and are completely gone within about two to six months. However, the prognosis is poor in people who develop organ changes or complications such as heart damage, neurological, or genitourinary problems caused by chronic ""'Brucella'' infection. The mortality (death) rate is low for brucellosis (about 0.4%-2%).' "
Is it possible to prevent brucellosis? Is there a brucellosis vaccine?,"'It is possible to prevent or reduce the chances of developing brucellosis. Simple methods such as avoiding known infected animals, never drinking unpasteurized milk, and, if associating with potentially infected animals, wearing gloves and/or a mask reduces the chances of infection.''Because brucellosis is mainly a disease involving livestock, vaccines have been developed that are effective for cattle, sheep, and goats. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine available for use in humans.' "
What is melanoma?,"'Melanoma is a ''cancer'' that develops in melanocytes, the pigment cells present in the skin. It can be more serious than the other forms of ''skin cancer'' because of a tendency to spread to other parts of the body (metastasize) and cause serious illness and death. About 50,000 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed in the United States every year.''Because most melanomas occur on the skin where they can be seen, patients or their spouses are often the first to detect suspicious tumors. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial. Caught early, most melanomas can be cured with relatively minor surgery.''This article is written from the standpoint of the patient. Instead of describing the disease in exhaustive detail, the article focuses on answering the questions: ""How do I know if I have melanoma?"" and ""Should I be checked for it?""''Guideline # 1'"": Nobody can conclusively diagnose one's self. A physician should examine new spots on the skin that ""'itch'', bleed, or enlarge. It is always better to be safe than sorry so if there is concern about a particular skin lesion see a medical specialist.''Everybody gets spots on their skin. The older we are, the more spots we have. Most of these spots are benign. That means they are neither cancerous nor on the way to becoming cancerous. These may include ''freckles'', benign ''moles'', collections of blood vessels called cherry angiomas, or raised, irregular, pigmented ''bumps on the skin'' called seborrheic keratoses.''Guideline # 2'': The vast majority of moles are benign lesions that do not turn into anything else. Most melanomas do not arise in preexisting moles. For that reason, having all of one\'s moles removed to ""prevent melanoma"" does not make sense.''Some people are born with moles (the medical name is ""''nevus'',"" plural ""''nevi''""). Almost everyone develops them, starting in childhood. On average, white Europeans have about 25 moles, though some have fewer and others many more. Moles may be flat or raised, and they may range in color from tan to light brown to black. Moles may lose their color and end up flesh colored. It is unusual to develop new pigmented moles after age 35.' "
What does melanoma look like? What are melanoma symptoms and signs?,"'Guideline # 3'': A changing spot may be a problem, but not every change means ''cancer''. A mole may appear and then get bigger or become raised but still be only a mole. It is normal for many moles to start flat and dark, become raised and dark, and then later lose much of their color. This process takes many years.''Most public health information about melanoma stresses the so-called ''ABCDE''s:''These guidelines are can be helpful, but the problem is that many pigmented lesions of the skin are not perfectly symmetrical in their shape or color. Many spots, which seem to have one or more of the ABCDEs, are in fact just ordinary benign skin tumors and are not dangerous. Additionally, some melanomas do not fit this description but may still be spotted by a primary care physician or dermatologist. Not all melanomas have color or are raised above the skin surface.'   Asymmetry: One half of the mole is different from the other half. Border irregularity: The spot has borders which are not smooth and regular but uneven or notched. Color: The spot has several colors in an irregular pattern or is a very different color than the rest of one's moles. Diameter: The spot is larger than the size of a pencil eraser (6 mm). Evolving: The mole is changing in size, shape, color, or overall texture. This may also include new bleeding."
What if the skin changes are rapid or dramatic?,"'Guideline # 4'': The more rapid and dramatic the change, the less serious the problem.''When changes such as ''pain'', swelling, or even bleeding come on rapidly, within a day or two, they are likely to be caused by minor ''trauma'"", often a kind one doesn't remember (like scratching the spot while sleeping). If a spot changes rapidly and then goes back to the way it was within a couple of weeks, or falls off altogether, it is not likely to represent anything serious. Nevertheless, this would be a good time to say once again: Nobody can diagnose him- or herself. If one sees a spot that looks as though it is new or changing, show it to a doctor. If one see a spot that doesn't look like one's other spots, it should be evaluated."" "
What are the causes and risk factors for melanoma?,"'Guideline # 5'"": Individual sunburns do raise one's risk of melanoma. However, slow daily sun exposure, even without burning, may also substantially raise someone's risk of ""'skin cancer''.'""Factors that raise one's risk for melanoma include the following:""'The presence of close (first-degree) family with melanoma is a high risk factor, although looking at all cases of melanoma, only 10% of cases run in families.''Having a history of other sun-induced ''skin cancers'"" raises one's risk of melanoma because they are markers of long-term sun exposure. The basic cell type is different, however, and a basal cell or ""'squamous cell carcinoma'' cannot ""turn into melanoma"" or vice versa.'   Caucasian (white) ancestry Fair skin, light hair, and light-colored eyes A history of intense, intermittent sun exposure, especially in childhood (This would include tanning booths.) Many (more than 100) moles Large, irregular, or ""funny looking"" moles Close blood relatives -- parents, siblings, and children -- with melanoma"
How can people estimate their level of risk for melanoma?,"""The best way to know one's risk level is to have a dermatologist perform a full body examination. That way one will find out whether the spots one has are moles and, if so, whether they are abnormal in the medical sense. More darkly pigmented individuals are at less risk skin ""'cancers'' in general and melanoma in particular.''The medical term for such moles is ''atypical'"". This is a somewhat confusing term, because among other things the criteria are not clear, and it's not certain that an atypical mole is necessarily ""'precancerous''. Patients who have lots of ""''atypical moles''"" (more than 24) do have a higher risk for developing melanoma but not necessarily within one of their existing funny-looking moles. It may be a challenge to find the ""baby melanoma"" in the middle of a back full of large, dark, or irregular moles. If someone has such moles, a doctor will recommend regular surveillance and may recommend biopsy of the most unusual or worrisome looking moles.''Sometimes, one learns at a routine skin evaluation that one does not necessarily need annual routine checkups. In other situations, a doctor may recommend regular checks at 6-month or yearly intervals.' "
What are the types of melanoma?,"'The main types of melanoma are as follows:' Superficial spreading melanoma: This type accounts for about 70% of all cases of melanoma. The most common locations are the legs of women and the backs of men, and they occur most commonly between the ages of 30-50. (Note: Melanomas can occur in other locations and at other ages, as well.) These melanomas are flat or barely raised and have a variety of colors. Such melanomas evolve over one to 5 years and can be readily caught at an early stage if they are detected and removed. An ""in situ"" melanoma (malignant melanoma in situ) refers to a very thin superficial spreading melanoma that does not extend deeper than the junction of the dermis and epidermis, the normal location for melanocytes. Nodular melanoma: About 20% of melanomas are thick, blue-black to purplish lumps. They may evolve faster and are more likely to spread. Untreated superficial spreading melanomas may become nodular and invasive. Lentigo maligna: Unlike other forms of melanoma, lentigo maligna tends to occur on places like the face, which are exposed to the sun constantly rather than intermittently. Lentigo maligna looks like a large, irregularly shaped or colored freckle and develops slowly. It may take many years to evolve into a more dangerous melanoma or may never become a more invasive form. Because of the unpredictability of future behavior, removal is recommended. There are also other rarer forms of melanoma that may occur, for example, under the nails (subungual), on the palms and soles (acral lentiginous), uveal or choroidal (ocular), oral or other mucosal areas such as the vulva or penis, or sometimes even inside the body such as the brain."
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose melanoma?,"'Most doctors diagnose melanoma by examining the spot causing concern and performing a minor surgical procedure called a biopsy. A ''skin biopsy'' refers to removing all or part of the skin spot under local anesthesia and sending the specimen to a pathologist for analysis. A small shave or punch biopsy which may be adequate for the diagnosis of other types of skin cancer is not the best for melanoma. To diagnose melanoma, the best biopsy is one that removes the entire extent of the visible tumor. Fine-needle aspiration may have a role in evaluating a swollen ''lymph node'' or a ''liver'' nodule but is not appropriate for the initial diagnosis of a suspicious skin lesion.''It is no longer recommended to do large batteries of screening tests on patients with thin, uncomplicated melanoma excisions, but patients who have had thicker tumors diagnosed or who already have signs and symptoms of metastatic melanoma may need to have ''MRIs'', PET scans, ''CT scans'', chest ''X-rays'', or other X-rays of bones when there is a concern of ''metastasis''.''The biopsy report may show any of the following:''Some doctors are skilled in a clinical technique called epiluminescence microscopy (also called dermatoscopy or dermoscopy). They may use a variety of instruments to evaluate the pigment and blood vessel pattern of a mole without having to remove it. Sometimes the findings support the diagnosis of possible melanoma, and at other times, the findings are reassuring that the spot is nothing to worry about. The standard for a conclusive diagnosis, however, remains a pathologic examination of a skin biopsy.'   A totally benign condition requiring no further treatment, such as a regular mole An atypical mole which, depending on the judgment of the doctor and the pathologist, may need a conservative removal (taking off a little bit of normal skin all around just to make sure that the spot is completely out). A thin melanoma requiring surgery A thicker melanoma requires more extensive surgery or extra tests in which the lymph nodes are examined. Sentinel node biopsy is a procedure in which a dye or radioactive tracer is injected into the tumor site and then draining lymph nodes are identified and removed for microscopic examination. A negative result suggests there has not yet been spread through the lymphatic chain for that area of skin. A positive result suggests there may other lymph nodes involved. Since the removal of draining lymph node basins causes physical problems and does not seem to improve longevity it is no longer generally recommended."
What are melanoma treatment options?,"'In general, early localized melanoma is treated by surgery alone.''An Internet search will name a variety of home remedies and natural products for the treatment of skin cancers, including melanoma. These include the usual topical and systemic antioxidants and naturopathic immune stimulators. There is no scientific data supporting any of these, and their use may lead to unnecessary delay in better established treatments, possibly with tragic results.'   Doctors have learned that surgery does not need to be as extensive as was thought years ago. When treating many early melanomas, for instance, surgeons only remove 1 centimeter (less than ½ inch) of the normal tissue surrounding the melanoma. Deeper and more advanced cancers may need more extensive surgery. Depending on various considerations (tumor thickness, body location, age, etc.), the removal of nearby lymph nodes may be recommended. For advanced disease, when the melanoma spreads to other parts of the body, treatments using immunotherapy or chemotherapy are often recommended. Many of these new treatments have produced rather impressive improvements in longevity ."
How do doctors determine the staging and prognosis (outlook) of a melanoma?,"""The most useful criterion for determining prognosis is tumor thickness. Tumor thickness is measured in fractions of millimeters and is called the Breslow's depth. The thinner the melanoma, the better the prognosis. Any spread to lymph nodes or other body locations dramatically worsens the prognosis. Thin melanomas, those measuring less than 0.75 millimeters when examined microscopically, have excellent cure rates, generally with local surgery alone. For thicker melanomas, the prognosis is guarded.""'Melanoma is staged according to thickness, ulceration, lymph node involvement, and the presence of distant metastasis. The staging of a cancer refers to the extent to which it has spread at the time of diagnosis, and staging is used to determine the appropriate treatment. Stages 1 and 2 are confined to the skin only and are treated with surgical removal with the size of margins of normal skin to be removed determined by the thickness of the melanoma. Stage 3 refers to a melanoma that has spread locally or through the usual lymphatic drainage. Stage 4 refers to distant metastases to other organs, generally by spread through the bloodstream.' "
What is recurrent melanoma?,"'Recurrent melanoma refers to a recurrence of tumor at the site of removal of a previous tumor, such as in, around, or under the surgical ''scar''. It may also refer to the appearance of metastatic melanoma in other body sites such as skin, lymph nodes, brain, or liver after the initial tumor has already been treated. Recurrence is most likely to occur within the first five years, but new tumors felt to be recurrences may show up decades later. Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish recurrences from new primary tumors.' "
What is metastatic melanoma?,"'Metastatic melanoma is melanoma that has spread beyond its original site in the skin to distant tissue sites. There are several types of metastatic melanoma. There may be spread through the lymphatic system to local lymph nodes. This may show up as swollen lymph glands (usually painless) or as a string of skin tumors along a lymphatic chain. Melanoma may also spread through the bloodstream (hematogenous spread), where it may appear in one or more distant sites, such as the ''lungs'', liver, brain, remote skin locations, or any other body location.'  "
What are the signs of symptoms of metastatic melanoma?,"'Signs and symptoms depend upon the site of metastasis and the amount of tumor there. Metastases to the brain may first appear as ''headaches'', unusual numbness in the arms and legs, or ''seizures''. Spread to the liver may be first identified by abnormal blood tests of ''liver function'' long before the patient has ''jaundice'', a swollen liver, or any other signs of liver failure. Spread to the kidneys may cause ''pain'' and ''blood in the urine''. Spread to the lungs may cause ''shortness of breath'', other trouble ''breathing'', ''chest pain'', and continued ''cough''. Spread to bones may cause bone pain or broken bones called pathologic ''fractures''. A very high tumor burden may lead to ''fatigue'', ''weight loss'', ''weakness'' and, in rare cases, the release of so much melanin into the circulation that the patient may develop brown or black urine and have their skin turn a diffuse slate-gray color. The appearance of multiple blue-gray nodules (hard ''bumps'') in the skin of a melanoma patient may indicate widespread melanoma metastases to remote skin sites.' "
What are the treatments for metastatic melanoma?,"""Historically, metastatic and recurrent melanoma have been poorly responsive to chemotherapy. Immunotherapy, in which the body's own immune system is energized to fight the tumor, has been a focus of research for decades. A variety of newer medications target different points in the pathways of melanoma cell growth and spread. While the most appropriate use of these medications is still being defined, the best treatment for melanoma remains complete surgical excision while it is still small, thin, and has not yet had a chance to spread.""'Initial therapies to stimulate the immune system to help contain metastatic melanoma included infusions of ''interferon''-alpha and interleukin-2 (both parts of the immune response to cancer and infection), and a few patients have responded to these therapies. There has, however, been an explosion recently in the approval of a number of targeted therapies that act on specific stages in the cell cycle, especially those of abnormal cells, and affect those growth processes of the tumor cells. ''Drugs'"" that inhibit the kinase enzymes necessary for cell reproduction, include cobimetinib (Cotellic) and trametinib (Mekinist). Others target the signals for cell growth from abnormal BRAF genes and the enzymes they drive. Such medications in this family include dabrafenib (Tafinlar), vemurafenib (Zelboraf), and nivolumab (Opdivo). Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) blocks the tumor's ability to inhibit T cell activity. Ipilimumab (Yervoy) works directly on the T-lymphocyte pathway to activate the immune system. Many of these medications are now being used in combinations to get better therapeutic effects than they would by themselves. All of these medications have significant side effects, including some that are life-threatening, and are indicated only for stage 3 tumors to try to prevent recurrence and spread and stage 4 metastatic tumors that are no longer amenable to surgery."" "
What are the survival rates for metastatic melanoma?,"""Survival rates for melanoma, especially for metastatic melanoma, vary widely according to many factors, including the patient's age, overall health, location of the tumor, particular findings on the examination of the biopsy, and of course the depth and stage of the tumor. Survival statistics are generally based on 5-year survival rates rather than raw cure rates. Much of the success reported for the targeted therapies focuses on disease-free time because in many cases the actual 5-year survival is not affected. It is hoped that combination therapy discussed above will change that."" For stage 1 (thin melanoma, local only), 5-year survival is ≥ 90%. For stage 2 (thicker melanoma, local only), 5-year survival is 80%-90%. For stage 3 (local and nodal metastasis), 5-year survival is around 50%. For stage 4 (distant metastasis), 5-year survival is 10%-25% depending upon sex and other demographic factors."
What methods are available to help prevent melanoma?,"   Reducing sun exposure: Avoidance of ultraviolet light exposure, including exposure in tanning booths, is the best means of helping to prevent melanoma, followed by wearing hats and opaque clothing, and then followed by broad-spectrum waterproof sunscreens applied liberally to exposed skin. The consensus among dermatologists is that sunscreens are helpful and are certainly preferable to unprotected sun exposure. (Despite sensational articles in the popular press, there is no credible evidence that sunscreens can cause melanoma. Data to indicate increased melanoma risk did not take into consideration that the sunscreens used by the subjects [at least as well as they could remember after decades] were far inferior to current products, which usually have much higher ultraviolet B SPF protection as well as ultraviolet A protection.) Early detection: Get one's skin checked at least once. Then, if it is recommended, have one's skin checked on a regular basis. The American Academy of Dermatology sponsors free skin cancer screening clinics every May all over the country. Special ""Pigmented Lesion Clinics"" have also been established in many medical centers to permit close clinical and photographic follow-up of patients at high risk. Screening of high-risk individuals: Anyone at high risk, such as anyone with a close relative who has melanoma, should be screened by a doctor for melanoma."
What research is being done on melanoma?,"'Research in melanoma is headed in three directions: ''prevention'', more precise diagnosis, and better treatment for advanced disease.' Prevention: Public education and more widely available screening clinics can increase public awareness of the need for sun avoidance, sunscreen use, avoidance of tanning booths, and early detection of suspicious spots. More precise diagnosis: Newer experimental techniques, such as the confocal scanning laser microscope, may help doctors make more certain calls on borderline or suspicious spots without having to biopsy. Better treatment for advanced disease: Because conventional chemotherapy has been disappointing with melanoma, researchers have turned their attention to biologic treatments of advanced melanoma to stimulate the body's own immune response against the tumor. These new biologic treatments include immune checkpoint inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and drugs that target cell growth based on genetic changes in the melanoma. Many of these treatments are still investigational and intended for patients with widespread, recurrent life-threatening disease."

What is skin cancer?,"'Most skin ''cancers'' are locally destructive cancerous (''malignant'') growth of the skin. They originate from the cells of the ''epidermis'', the superficial layer of the skin. Unlike cutaneous ''malignant melanoma'', the vast majority of these sorts of skin cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body (''metastasize'') and become life-threatening.''There are three major types of ''skin cancer'': (1) ''basal cell carcinoma'' (the most common), (2) ''squamous cell carcinoma'' (the second most common), which originate from skin cells, and (3) ''melanoma'', which originates from the pigment-producing skin cells (melanocytes) but is less common, though more dangerous, than the first two varieties. Other rare forms of ''skin cancer'' include ''lymphomas'', Merkel cell cancers, and cancers of other tissue in the skin, including sarcomas as well as hair and sweat gland tumors. In this article, we will only be reviewing the most common forms of cancers, basal cell ''carcinoma'' and squamous cell carcinoma.'  "
What are the risk factors for skin cancer?,"'The most common risk factors for ''skin cancer'' are as follows.' Ultraviolet light exposure, either from the sun or from tanning beds. Fair-skinned individuals, with hazel or blue eyes, and people with blond or red hair are particularly vulnerable. The problem is worse in areas of high elevation or near the equator where sunlight exposure is more intense. A chronically suppressed immune system (immunosuppression) from underlying diseases such as HIV/AIDS infection or cancer, or from some medications such as prednisone or chemotherapy Exposure to ionizing radiation (X-rays) or chemicals known to predispose to cancer such as arsenic Certain types of sexually acquired wart virus infections People who have a history of one skin cancer have a 20% chance of developing second skin cancer in the next two years. Elderly patients have more skin cancers."
Is skin cancer hereditary?,"'Since most skin cancers are caused by ultraviolet light exposure, skin cancers are generally not considered to be ''inherited''. But the fact that skin cancer is much more common among poorly pigmented individuals and that skin color is inherited does support the proposition that genetics is very important. There are some very rare genetic syndromes that result in an increased number of skin cancers in those affected.' "
What causes skin cancer?,"'Except in rare instances, most skin cancers arise from DNA mutations induced by ultraviolet light affecting cells of the epidermis. Many of these early cancers seem to be controlled by natural immune surveillance, which when compromised, may permit the development of masses of malignant cells that begin to grow into tumors.' "
What are the different types of skin cancer?,"'There are several different types of skin cancers:' Basal cell carcinoma is the most common cancer in humans. Over 1 million new cases of basal cell carcinoma are diagnosed in the U.S. each year. There are several different types of basal cell carcinoma, including the superficial type, the least worrisome variety; the nodular type, the most common; and the morpheaform, the most challenging to treat because the tumors often grow into the surrounding tissue (infiltrate) without a well-defined border. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for about 20% of all skin cancers but is more common in immunosuppressed people. In most instances, its biologic behavior is much like basal cell carcinoma with a small but significant chance of distant spread. Less common skin cancers include melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, atypical fibroxanthoma, cutaneous lymphoma, and dermatofibrosarcoma."
What are the signs and symptoms of skin cancer?,"'Most basal cell carcinomas have few if any symptoms. Squamous cell carcinomas may be painful. Both forms of skin cancer may appear as a sore that bleeds, oozes, crusts, or otherwise will not heal. They begin as a slowly growing bump on the skin that may bleed after minor ''trauma''. Both kinds of skin cancers may have raised edges and central ulceration.''Signs and symptoms of basal cell carcinomas include:''Signs and symptoms of squamous cell carcinomas include:''Actinic keratoses'' (AK), also called solar keratoses, are scaly, crusty lesions caused by damage from ultraviolet light, often in the facial area, ''scalp'', and backs of the hands. These are considered precancers because if untreated, up to 10% of actinic keratoses may develop into squamous cell carcinomas.'   Appearance of a shiny pink, red, pearly, or translucent bump Pink skin growths or lesions with raised borders that are crusted in the center A raised reddish patch of skin that may crust or itch, but is usually not painful A white, yellow, or waxy area with a poorly defined border that may resemble a scar Persistent, scaly red patches with irregular borders that may bleed easily Open sore that does not go away for weeks A raised growth with a rough surface that is indented in the middle A wart-like growth"
When is a mole dangerous or high risk for becoming a skin cancer?,"'Moles'' are almost always harmless and only very rarely turn into skin cancer. If a mole becomes cancerous, it would be a melanoma. There is a ''precancerous'' stage, called a ''dysplastic nevus'', which is somewhat more irregular than a normal mole. An early sign of melanoma is noticing a difference in a mole: asymmetry, irregular border, color changes, increasing diameter, or other evolving changes may signify a mole is a melanoma. ''Moles'' never become squamous cell carcinomas or basal cell carcinomas.' "
What are the most common sites where skin cancer develops?,"'Skin cancers typically arise in areas of the skin exposed to the sun repeatedly over many years such as on the face and nose, ears, back of the neck, and the bald area of the scalp. Less commonly, these tumors may appear at sites with only limited sun exposure such as the back, chest, or the extremities. However, skin cancer may occur anywhere on the skin.' "
How do physicians diagnose skin cancer?,"'A skin examination by a dermatologist is the way to get a definitive diagnosis of skin cancer. In many cases, the appearance alone is sufficient to make the diagnosis.''A ''skin biopsy'' is usually used to confirm a suspicion of skin cancer. This is performed by numbing the area under the ''tumor'' with a local anesthetic such as ''lidocaine''. A small portion of the tumor is sliced away and sent for examination by a pathologist, who looks at the tissue under a microscope and renders a diagnosis based on the characteristics of the tumor.'  "
What is the staging for skin cancer?,"'There is no specific staging system for basal cell carcinoma. If the tumor is wider than 2 cm (about ¾ inch diameter), it is probably a more serious tumor. Basal cell carcinomas of the ears, nose, and ''eyelid'' may also be of more concern, regardless of the size.''There is a staging system for squamous cell carcinoma. Large tumors that are thicker than 2 mm, invade the nerve structures of the skin, occur on the ear, and have certain worrisome characteristics under the microscope are of more concern. If the tumor metastasizes to a site at some distance from the ''primary tumor'', the cancer is likely to be a dangerous tumor.' "
What is the treatment for skin cancer?,"'There are several effective means of treating skin cancer. The choice of therapy depends on the location and size of the tumor, the microscopic characteristics of the cancer, and the general health of the patient.' 

Read Doctor's View
  Topical medications: In the case of superficial basal cell carcinomas, some creams, gels, and solutions can be used, including imiquimod (Aldara), which works by stimulating the body's immune system causing it to produce interferon which attacks the cancer, and fluorouracil (5-FU), a chemotherapy drug. Some patients do not experience any side effects of these topical treatments, but others may have redness, inflammation, and irritation. A drawback of topical medications is that there is no tissue available to examine to determine if a tumor is removed completely. Destruction by electrodessication and curettage (EDC): The tumor area is numbed with a local anesthetic and is repeatedly scraped with a sharp instrument (curette), and the edge is then cauterized with an electric needle. The advantage of this method is that it is fast, easy, and relatively inexpensive. The disadvantages are that the scar is often somewhat unsightly, and the recurrence rate is as high as 15%. Surgical excision: The area around the tumor is numbed with a local anesthetic. A football-shaped portion of tissue including the tumor is then removed and then the wound edges are closed with sutures. For very big tumors, skin grafts or flaps are needed to close the defect. The advantages of this form of treatment are that there is a greater than 90% cure rate, the surgical specimen can be examined to be sure that the whole tumor is successfully removed, and the scar produced is usually more cosmetically acceptable than that of the EDC procedure. It is a more complicated procedure and is more expensive than EDC. Mohs micrographic surgery: The site is locally anesthetized and the surgeon removes the visible tumor with a small margin of normal tissue. The tissue is immediately evaluated under a microscope and areas that demonstrate residual microscopic tumor involvement are re-excised and the margins are re-examined. This cycle continues until no further tumor is seen. This more complicated and expensive option is the treatment of choice for tumors where normal tissue preservation is vital, where the tumor margins are poorly defined, in tumors that have been previously treated and have recurred, and in certain high-risk tumors. Radiation therapy: Ten to fifteen treatment sessions deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor and a small surrounding skin area. This form of treatment is useful in those who are not candidates for any surgical procedure. The advantage of radiation therapy is that there is no cutting involved. The disadvantages of this expensive alternative are that the treated area cannot be tested to be sure the whole tumor is gone and radiation scars look worse over time. It is, for this reason, it is usually reserved for elderly patients. Other types of treatments for skin cancers include cryosurgery where tissue is destroyed by freezing, photodynamic therapy (PDT) in which medication and blue light are used to destroy the cancerous tissue, laser surgery to vaporize (ablate) the skin's top layer and destroy lesions, and oral medications vismodegib (Erivedge) and sonidegib (Odomzo)."
What kinds of doctors treat skin cancer?,"'The main type of doctor who will treat skin cancer is a dermatologist. Your primary care physician or internist may first notice a sign of skin cancer but will refer you to a dermatologist for further testing and treatment. You may also see an oncologist, which is a cancer specialist.''If you have surgical removal of a tumor, depending on how much skin is removed, you may see ''plastic'' or reconstructive surgeon after the tumor removal to help restore the appearance of the skin, especially on the face.' "
What is the prognosis and survival rate for skin cancer?,"'The prognosis for ''nonmelanoma skin cancer'' is generally excellent. Both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are highly curable. There are virtually no deaths from basal cell carcinoma and only rare deaths with squamous cell carcinoma skin cancers, mostly in immunosuppressed individuals. Depending on the method of treatment and the location and type of skin cancer, the likelihood of a recurrence of a previously treated skin cancer is as low as 1% to 2% for ''Mohs surgery'' and up to 10% to 15% for destruction by electrodesiccation and curettage.''Early detection of skin cancers can lead to better outcomes. Know your skin and if you have any moles or spots that are suspect, see a dermatologist for a skin ''cancer screening''. Awareness is key in identifying and treating skin cancers early.' "
Is it possible to prevent skin cancer?,"'Many skin cancers can be prevented by avoiding triggers that cause tumors to develop. ''Prevention'' strategies include protection from the sun by the use of sunscreens, protective clothing, and avoidance of the sun during the peak hours of 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Parents should ensure children are protected from the sun. Do not use tanning beds, which are a major cause of excess ultraviolet light exposure and a significant risk factor for skin cancer. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) has noted a dramatic rise in the numbers and cost of skin cancer. Furthermore, there has been an increase in the total number of skin cancers and that new breakthrough treatments for melanoma, although expensive, comprise only a small portion of the total cost of skin cancer treatment. Most skin cancers are treated cost efficiently by dermatologists in an office setting.' "
Sunscreen use and vitamin D,"'A major source of ''vitamin D'"" comes from sunlight exposure, which leads to the production of the vitamin in the skin. Some argue sunscreens block out so much of the sun's rays that inadequate ""'vitamin D'' synthesis results. In fact, very few people actually apply ''sunscreen'' to every inch of their exposed skin, so ''vitamin D'' synthesis does occur. There is no reason not to use sunscreens because of a fear of low vitamin D. If there is a concern, vitamin D can be obtained by eating leafy vegetables or taking an oral multivitamin supplement.' "
What is melanosis coli?,"'Melanosis coli is a condition usually associated with chronic ''laxative'' use in which dark pigment is deposited in the lamina propria (one of the lining layers) of the ''large intestine'' (colon). The pigment deposition results in a characteristic dark brown to black discoloration of the lining of the large intestine. This condition is sometimes called pseudomelanosis coli because the pigment deposits consist of a pigment known as lipofuscin and do not contain ''melanin'' as implied by the term ""melanosis."" Lipofuscin is a cellular pigment that forms when cells are destroyed, often called ""wear and tear"" pigment that can be found throughout the body. '""The dark color of the intestinal lining may be uniform or patterned, and the discoloration may be slight or very pronounced. The intensity and pattern of the discoloration may even vary among different sites in the colon of a single person. The condition may also be reversed upon discontinuation of laxative use. In some cases, the wall of the colon appears normal to the eye, but microscopic evaluation of biopsies by a pathologist reveals areas of pigment in the colon's lining. The pigment in melanosis coli does not accumulate in polyps or tumors of the large intestine. "" "
What are the symptoms of melanosis coli?,'Melanosis coli does not cause symptoms. '  
What causes melanosis coli?,"'Melanosis coli usually results from chronic use of laxatives of the anthranoid group. Some examples of anthranoid laxatives are ''senna'' (sennosides; Senocot, ''Senokot'' EXTRA and others) and rhubarb derivatives. Many of these laxatives have been in use for hundreds of years. In 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the use of the popular anthranoid laxativephenolphthalein due to fears that it might be carcinogenic (''cancer''-causing). Animal studies had shown that extremely high doses of phenolphthalein led to tumors in animals, but it has never been shown to cause ''cancers'' in humans. ''The anthranoid laxatives pass through the gastrointestinal tract unabsorbed until they reach the large intestine, where they are changed into their active forms. The resulting active compounds cause damage to the cells in the lining of the intestine and leads to apoptosis (a form of cell death). The damaged (apoptotic) cells appear as darkly pigmented bodies that may be taken up by scavenger cells known as macrophages. When enough cells have been damaged, the characteristic pigmentation of the bowel wall develops. The condition can develop after just a few months of laxative use.' "
How is melanosis coli diagnosed?,"'Melanosis coli can be observed during endoscopic procedures that examine the large intestine, such as ''colonoscopy'' and ''sigmoidoscopy''. Sometimes the diagnosis is made upon microscopic examination of biopsies taken during endoscopic procedures.' "
What is the prognosis (outcome) of melanosis coli?,"'If a person stops using anthranoid laxatives, the changes associated with melanosis coli lessen over time and may disappear. ''Early studies suggested that anthranoid laxatives might have carcinogenic or ''tumor''-promoting activities in humans and that the presence of melanosis coli might signal an increased risk for the development of ''colorectal cancer''. However, more recent follow-up studies have failed to show an association between ''colon cancer'' and anthranoid laxative use or between colon ''cancer'' and the finding of melanosis coli. ' "

Experts believe that the dark patches in melasma could be triggered by several factors, including ''pregnancy'', ''birth control pills'', ''hormone replacement therapy'' (''HRT'' and ''progesterone''), family history of melasma, race, and anti-''seizure'' medications. Sunlight is considered the most important factor in the production of melasma, especially in individuals with a genetic predisposition to this condition. Clinical studies have shown that individuals typically develop melasma in the summer months, when the sun is most intense. In the winter, the pigmentation in melasma tends regress.''When melasma occurs during pregnancy, it is also called chloasma, or ""the ''mask of pregnancy''."" ''Pregnant'' women experience increased estrogen, ''progesterone'', and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) levels during the second and third ''trimesters'' of pregnancy. Melanocytes are the cells in the skin that deposit pigment. However, it is thought that pregnancy-related melasma is caused by the presence of increased levels of progesterone and not due to estrogen and MSH. Studies have shown that ''postmenopausal'' women who receive progesterone ''hormone replacement therapy'' are more likely to develop melasma. ''Postmenopausal'' women receiving estrogen alone seem less likely to develop melasma.''In addition, products or treatments that irritate the skin may cause an increase in ''melanin'' production and accelerate melasma symptoms.''People with a genetic predisposition or known family history of melasma are at an increased risk of developing melasma. Important prevention methods for these individuals include sun avoidance and application of extra sunblock to avoid stimulating pigment production. These individuals may also consider discussing their concerns with their doctor and avoiding ''birth control'' pills and hormone replacement therapy (''HRT'') if possible.'  "
Where does melasma appear on the body?,"'Melasma is characterized by discoloration or ''hyperpigmentation'' primarily on the face.''Three types of common facial patterns have been identified in melasma, including the;''The centrofacial pattern is the most prevalent form of melasma and includes\xa0the;''The malar pattern includes the upper cheeks. The jawbone pattern is specific to the jaw.''The upper sides of the neck may less commonly be involved in melasma. Rarely, melasma may occur on other body parts like the forearms. One study confirmed the occurrence of melasma on the forearms of people being given progesterone. This was a unique pattern seen in a Native American study.'   center of the face (centrofacial), cheekbones (malar), and jawbone (mandibular). forehead, cheeks, upper lip, nose, and chin."
What are the types of melasma?,'There are four types of pigmentation patterns in melasma:' Epidermal melasma is identified by the presence of excess melanin in the superficial layers of skin. Dermal melasma is distinguished by the presence of melanophages (cells that ingest melanin) throughout the dermis. Mixed melasma includes both the epidermal and dermal type. Excess melanocytes are present in the skin of dark-skinned individuals.
What tests diagnose melasma?,"""Melasma is readily diagnosed by recognizing the typical appearance of brown skin patches on the face. Dermatologists are physicians who specialize in skin disorders and often diagnose melasma by visually examining the skin. A black light or Wood's light (340-400 nm) can assist in diagnosing melasma, although is not essential for diagnosis. In most cases, mixed melasma is diagnosed, which means the discoloration is due to pigment in the dermis and ""'epidermis''. Rarely, a ''skin biopsy'' may be necessary to help exclude other causes of this local skin hyperpigmentation.' "
What are the best treatments for melasma?,"'List of melasma medication treatments.'""Other proprietary ingredients and mixtures of ingredients as in Elure, Lumixyl, and SkinMedica's Lytera products""   The most common melasma therapies include 2% hydroquinone (HQ) creams like the over-the-counter products Esoterica and Porcelana and prescription-strength medications such as Obagi Clear, NeoCutis Blanche, and 4% hydroquinone. Certain sunscreens also contain 4% hydroquinone, such as Glytone Clarifying Skin Bleaching Sunvanish SPF 23 and Obagi's Sunfader sunscreen. Products with HQ concentrations above 2% sometimes require a prescription or are dispensed through physician's practices. Clinical studies show that creams containing 2% HQ can be effective in lightening the skin and are less irritating than higher concentrations of HQ for melasma. Creams are usually applied to the brown patches twice a day. Sunscreen should be applied over the hydroquinone cream every morning. There are treatments for all types of melasma, but the epidermal type responds better to treatment than the others because the pigment is closer to the skin surface. Melasma may clear spontaneously without treatment. Other times, it may clear with sunscreen usage and sun avoidance. In some people, the discoloration with melasma may disappear following pregnancy or if birth control pills and hormone therapy are discontinued. In order to treat melasma, combination or specially formulated creams with hydroquinone, a phenolic hypopigmenting agent, azelaic acid, and retinoic acid (tretinoin), nonphenolic bleaching agents, and/or kojic acid may be prescribed. For severe cases of melasma, creams with a higher concentration of HQ or combining HQ with other ingredients such as tretinoin, corticosteroids, or glycolic acid may be effective in lightening the skin. Azelaic acid 15%-20% (Azelex, Finacea) Retinoic acid 0.025%-0.1% (tretinoin) Tazarotene 0.5%-0.1% (Tazorac cream or gel) Adapalene 0.1%-0.3% (Differin gel) Kojic acid Lactic acid lotions 12% (Lac-Hydrin or Am-Lactin) Glycolic acid 10%-20% creams (Citrix cream, NeoStrata) Glycolic acid peels 10%-70% Possible side effects of melasma treatments include temporary skin irritation. People who use HQ treatment in very high concentrations for prolonged periods (usually several months to years) are at risk of developing a side effect called exogenous ochronosis. In ochronosis, the skin darkens while the bleaching agent is used. Hydroquinone-induced ochronosis is a permanent skin discoloration that is thought to result from use of hydroquinone concentrations above 4%. Although ochronosis is fairly uncommon in the U.S., it is more common in areas like Africa where hydroquinone concentrations upward of 10%-20% may be used to treat skin discoloration like melasma. Regardless of the potential side effects, HQ remains the most widely used and successful fading cream for treating melasma worldwide. HQ should be discontinued at the first signs of ochronosis."
Which melasma treatments can be done at a doctor's office?,"'Many types and strengths of chemical peels are available for different skin types. The type of peel should be tailored for each individual and selected by the physician. In treating melasma, 30%-70% glycolic acid peels are very common. Various combinations, including a mix of 10% glycolic acid and 2% HQ, can be used to treat melasma.''Microdermabrasion'' utilizes vacuum suction and an abrasive material like fine diamond chips or aluminum oxide crystals to ''exfoliate'' the top layers of the skin. The vacuum pressure is adjusted depending on the sensitivity and tolerance of the skin. Typical ''microdermabrasion'' sessions can last anywhere from a few minutes to one hour. Minimal to no recovery time is needed after microdermabrasion. Microdermabrasion techniques can improve melasma, but dramatic results are not generally seen or expected after one or two treatments. Multiple treatments in combination with sunscreen and other creams yield best results.''There is no guarantee that melasma will be improved with these procedures. In some cases, if treatments are too harsh or abrasive, melasma can be induced or worsen. Additionally, these procedures are almost always considered cosmetic and may not be covered by medical insurance providers.' "
Does laser treatment work for melasma? Is it safe if you are pregnant?,"'Lasers may be used in melasma, but they generally produce only temporary results. Laser therapy is not the primary choice to treat melasma as studies reveal little to no improvement in the hyperpigmentation for most patients. Lasers may actually worsen some types of melasma and should be used with caution. Multiple laser treatments may be necessary to see results, as treatments are most effective when they are repeated.'""To ensure that treatment doesn't fail, people must minimize sun exposure. People who treat their melasma report a better quality of life because they feel better about themselves. As with any treatment, people should consult their physician.""'Pregnant women or mothers ''breastfeeding'' may need to wait to treat melasma. Many melasma creams need to be discontinued in pregnancy and ''breastfeeding'' because of possible risks to the developing fetus and ''newborn''.\xa0 During pregnancy women\xa0may want to try\xa0''cosmetics'' to temporarily conceal the skin discoloration.' "
How do hydroquinone creams treat melasma?,'Researchers believe that the hydroxyphenolic chemical (HQ) blocks a step in a specific enzymatic pathway that involves tyrosinase. Tyrosinase is the enzyme that converts ''dopamine'' to melanin. Melanin gives skin its color.' 
Are there non-hydroquinone alternative treatments for melasma?,"'Azelaic acid is a non-hydroquinone cream that can be used to treat melasma. Studies have reported that 15%-20% azelaic acid was very effective and safe in melasma, although the overall results are significantly less impressive than 4% hydroquinone. There are no major complications reported with azelaic acid. Possible minor side effects include ''itching'' (pruritus), redness (erythema), scaling (dry patches), and a temporary burning sensation that tends to improve after 14-30 days of use. Currently, there is no FDA indication for the use of azelaic acid in the treatment of melasma.''Tretinoin cream (''Retin A'', ''Renova'', ''Retin A'' Micro) contains a ''vitamin A'' analogue (a retinoid) that seems to have efficacy in treating melasma. Most often, tretinoin is used in combination with other creams like azelaic acid or hydroquinone. Mild localized side effects are fairly common and include peeling, ''dry skin'', and irritation. Although it is not ""indicated"" for the treatment of melasma, it has been shown to have a beneficial effect. Other retinoid creams like tazaratone and adapelene may be helpful, as well.''Recently, while studying ''tranexamic acid'', a new drug in used to treat women with excessive bleeding during ''menstruation'', it was coincidentally found that their melasma improved. Although this drug is available in the United States for the treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding, it does not currently have an indication for the treatment of melasma.' "
What strength of SPF sunscreen is recommended for melasma?,"'A daily sun protection factor (''SPF'') of at least 50 that contains physical blockers, such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, is recommended to block UV rays, but it is important to have a sunblock that also covers for UVA protection. Chemical blockers may not fully block both types of UV-A and UV-B as effectively as zinc or titanium. The regular use of sun protection enhances the effectiveness of melasma treatments.' "
What is the prognosis for melasma? Can you get rid of it?,"'Although melasma tends to be a chronic disorder with periodic ups and downs, the prognosis for most cases is good. Just as melasma develops slowly, clearance also tends to be slow. The gradual disappearance of dark spots is based on establishing the right treatment combination for each individual skin type. Melasma cases that do not successfully respond to treatment are due to excessive sun exposure.'  "
Can you prevent melasma?,"'Sometimes melasma may be preventable by avoiding facial sun exposure. In most cases, prevention is difficult. Individuals who have a family history of melasma must take extra precautions to prevent melasma. The most important way to prevent the onset of melasma and premature ''aging'' is to avoid the sun. If exposure to sunlight cannot be avoided, then hats, ''sunglasses'', and sunblock with physical blockers should be worn.' "
What is melioidosis?  What causes melioidosis?,"""Melioidosis, also called Whitmore's Disease, is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium called ""'Burkholderia pseudomallei'' (previously known as ''Pseudomonas'' pseudomallei''). The bacteria are found in contaminated water and soil and spread to humans and animals through direct contact with the contaminated source. The bacteria are also of some concern as a potential agent for biological warfare and biological terrorism.''Melioidosis is similar to glanders disease, which is passed to humans from infected domestic animals.' "
What are risk factors for melioidosis?,"'Risk factors for developing melioidosis infection include''Other possible risk factors that may contribute to infection with melioidosis include steroid and other immunosuppressive therapy, rheumatic ''heart disease'', ''congestive heart failure'', pulmonary hemosiderosis, chronic granulomatous disease, and ''tuberculosis''.' living in Southeast Asia and northern Australia, diabetes, alcohol abuse, chronic renal disease, chronic lung disease, liver disease, thalassemia, kava consumption, cancer or another immune-suppressing condition not related to HIV, and chronic lung disease (such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or (COPD), and bronchiectasis)."
What are signs and symptoms of melioidosis?,"'There are several different types of melioidosis, each with its own signs and symptoms.'   Pulmonary infection: Melioidosis signs and symptoms most commonly stem from lung disease where the infection can form a cavity of pus (abscess). The effects of a pulmonary infection can range from mild bronchitis to severe pneumonia. As a result, patients also may experience fever, headache, loss of appetite (anorexia), cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and general muscle soreness. Localized infection: The effects can also be localized to infection on the skin (cellulitis) with pain or swelling, ulceration, and abscess, with associated fever and muscle aches. Bloodstream infection: If melioidosis enters the bloodstream, symptoms can include fever, headache, respiratory distress, abdominal discomfort, joint pain, and disorientation. Disseminated infection: Melioidosis can spread from the skin through the blood to become a chronic form of melioidosis affecting the heart, brain, liver, kidneys, joints, and eyes. Symptoms of a disseminated melioidosis infection include fever, weight loss, stomach or chest pain, muscle or joint pain, headache, and seizures."
Is melioidosis contagious?,"'Melioidosis is minimally ''contagious''. It can be spread from person to person, though it is rare. The most common route of infection with melioidosis is through direct contact with contaminated soil and water, especially though open wounds on the skin. Humans and animals can also acquire the infection by inhaling dust particles or water droplets or ingesting water that is contaminated.' "
What specialists treat melioidosis?,"'Primary-care providers (PCPs), such as family practitioners, internists, pediatricians, and emergency-medicine specialists may initially treat patients, but individuals with severe complications may be treated by infectious-disease specialists or critical-care specialists.' "
How do health-care professionals diagnose melioidosis?,"'The diagnosis of melioidosis is made with a microscopic evaluation of a blood, urine, sputum, or skin-lesion sample in the laboratory. A blood test is useful to detect early acute cases of melioidosis, but it cannot exclude the illness if it is negative.' "
What is the incubation period for melioidosis?,"'The incubation period for melioidosis ranges from one to 21 days, with an average of nine days to onset of infection. Symptoms typically appear two to four weeks after exposure.' "
Where does melioidosis occur?,"'Melioidosis is most frequently reported in southeast Asia, northern Australia, south Asia (including India), and China. The majority of patients are from Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and northern Australia. Melioidosis has also been reported in Papua New Guinea and New Caledonia. The bacterium that causes the disease is found in the soil, rice paddies, and stagnant waters of the area. People acquire the disease by inhaling dust contaminated by the bacteria and when the contaminated soil comes in contact with abraded (scraped) area of the skin. Infection most commonly occurs during the rainy season.''In the United States, confirmed cases range from none to five each year and occur among ''travelers'' and immigrants, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC).' "
What is the treatment for melioidosis?,"'The treatment of melioidosis involves antibiotics and depends on the location of the disease.''For patients with more mild illness, the CDC recommends medication with antibiotics such as imipenem, ''meropenem'' (''Merrem''), ''penicillin'', ''doxycycline'' (Doryx, ''Oracea'', Monodox), ''amoxicillin''-clavulanic acid (''Augmentin'', Augmentin XR), ceftazidime (Fortaz, Tazicef), ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (''Timentin''), ceftriaxone (Rocephin), and aztreonam (Cayston, ''Azactam''). Patients who are more severely ill are given a combination of two of the above medications for three to six months.''After the initial intensive therapy, eradication therapy may be initiated using ''trimethoprim''-''sulfamethoxazole'' (''Bactrim'', Sulfatrim).''With pulmonary involvement of melioidosis, if cultures remain positive for six months, surgical removal of the lung abscess with lobectomy is considered.' "
Is it possible to prevent melioidosis?,"'Prevention of infection in areas where melioidosis occurs includes minimizing risk of exposure to the bacteria.' People with compromised immune systems (such as AIDS, cancer, those undergoing chemotherapy, etc.), open skin wounds, diabetes, or chronic renal disease should avoid contact with soil and contaminated water, especially in farm areas. People who work in agriculture should wear proper gear, including work boots, to prevent infection in the feet and legs. Health-care workers should use standard safety precautions, including masks, gloves, and gown to prevent infection."
What is the prognosis for melioidosis?,"'Untreated, melioidosis is fatal. When treated with antibiotics, severe forms of the illness with ''sepsis'' and complications that arise from that condition have an overall mortality rate of approximately 40%.' "

High blood pressure (hypertension),"'About one-sixth of all Americans have ''high blood pressure'' and the incidence of this disease increases with age. African-Americans are more likely than other races to have ''high blood pressure''.''High blood pressure'' can cause arterial disease (''atherosclerosis'') that can lead to ''heart attack'', ''congestive heart failure'', ''stroke'', and ''kidney failure''.' High blood pressure: systolic >140, and/or diastolic >90  Borderline high blood pressure: systolic 130-140, and/or diastolic 85-90 How often blood pressure should be checked depends on how severely elevated the blood pressure is, and also depends on the number of other heart attack and stroke risk factors that are present. Adults with most recent normal blood pressure of systolic <130 and diastolic <85 should be checked at least every other year. Adults with borderline high blood pressures (systolic 130-140 or diastolic 85-90) should be rechecked in 3-6 months. High blood pressure can cause arterial disease (atherosclerosis) that can lead to heart attack, congestive heart failure, stroke, and kidney failure. High blood pressure can cause diseases without any early warning symptoms. There is good evidence that treatment of high blood pressure can reduce the risk of heart diseases, stroke, and kidney failure. There is good evidence that adults with borderline blood pressures can benefit from blood pressure lowering. Therefore, you should discuss with your doctor measures that you can take to reduce blood pressure, which can include reducing salt intake, exercise, and stress management."
"Hypercholesterolemia (hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia)","'Elevated ''LDL cholesterol'' or low ''HDL cholesterol'' increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis (""''hardening of the arteries''""). Atherosclerosis can begin to develop in adolescence and progress without any symptoms for many years and it leads to heart attack and stroke later in life.''Hyperlipidemia'' is a common and treatable cause of atherosclerosis.

The goal is to diagnose and retard or reverse atherosclerosis while it is still in a silent early state before complications occur.'  total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, ""bad"" cholesterol,  HDL cholesterol, ""good"" cholesterol, total/HDL cholesterol ratio, and  triglycerides. All adults over 20 should have a lipid panel every 5 years if LDL cholesterol is less than 130, and every 1-3 years if LDL cholesterol is borderline (between 130 and 160). LDL is the part of the cholesterol panel that is most significant when determining treatment, as well as determining how often lipid panels should be checked. Tests may be carried out more frequently in those with risk factors for heart or vascular disease or when medically indicated. Elevated LDL cholesterol or low HDL cholesterol increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries). Atherosclerosis can begin to develop in adolescence and progress without any symptoms for many years. It leads to heart attack and stroke later in life. There is good evidence that lowering elevated or borderline LDL cholesterol and increasing low HDL is beneficial in heart attack prevention and in some cases stroke prevention in subjects with or without known atherosclerosis. Treatment of elevated or borderline cholesterol is multi-dimensional. Individuals should discuss potential treatments with their doctor, including nutritional planning (regarding total calorie, total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol intake) as well as weight reduction and regular exercise.

Type II diabetes mellitus,"'Diabetes mellitus'' is a condition with elevated blood ''sugar'' level (''hyperglycemia'') due to impaired utilization of ''insulin'', decreased production of insulin, or both.''Diabetes'' is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. An estimated 18% of all Americans over 65 years of age have ''diabetes''. Over ten million Americans have been diagnosed with ''diabetes'', and at least half as many more are thought to have diabetes that is undiagnosed. Many more have a condition that precedes diabetes, referred to as ''prediabetes'', characterized by elevated blood ''sugar'' levels but to a lesser degree than is present in those with diabetes.''Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of ''blindness'' in adults aged 20-74 years, the leading cause of chronic kidney failure, and the leading cause of lower extremity amputations not related to injury. Individuals with diabetes are two to four times as likely to have a heart attack or stroke as are those without diabetes.''Healthy adults over 45 years should have ''fasting blood glucose'' level checked every 3 years.''Adults at a higher than normal risk of developing diabetes mellitus should be checked more frequently than every three years; these individuals include:' Fasting blood sugar (blood sugar test after at least 8 hours without calories), normal level less than 126 mg/dl  Two hour postprandial blood sugar (blood sugar test 2 hours after a meal), normal level less than 140mg/dl People who are overweight  Blood relatives with type II diabetes  Certain ethnic groups such as certain Native Americans, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asians Individuals with prediabetes Low HDL cholesterol (35 mg/dl. or less) or elevated triglyceride level (over 250 mg/dl) Diabetes mellitus can cause atherosclerosis that can lead to heart attack, stroke, and compromise of arterial circulation to the legs and feet. Diabetes mellitus also can damage the nerves, eyes, and kidneys.  Diabetes mellitus commonly causes organ damage without symptoms until extensive damage is present.  There is good evidence that controlling hyperglycemia in diabetes with medications, diet, weight control, and regular exercise can slow the development of atherosclerosis and heart, eye, nerve, and kidney damage.  There is good evidence that curtailing total calorie intake (especially intake of processed starches, sugar and sweets), regular exercise, and losing excess weight can help prevent the development of type II diabetes mellitus, especially in adults at higher than normal risk of developing diabetes."
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus),"'HIV'' is the virus that causes ''AIDS'' (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). While modern anti-''HIV'' medications have significantly improved long-term survival and quality of life of ''HIV'' infected individuals, there is still no cure or ''vaccine''. HIV infection is still eventually lethal in everyone who is infected. Therefore, preventing the spread of HIV is the most important step in preventing illness and death due to HIV infection.''The following individuals should be routinely offered HIV testing:''Most infected individuals will develop a positive HIV blood test within 3 months of being exposed to HIV. If the ''HIV test'' at 3 months is negative and there are risk factors for infection, the test should be repeated in another 3 months.' Screening blood test for antibodies to HIV is called an ELISA test. Confirmatory test for antibodies to HIV is called a Western blot. HIV-infected individuals can remain free of symptoms for many years; they will know if they are infected ONLY if a blood test for HIV is done. HIV testing can be performed by a physician or at a testing center. pregnant women; individuals with occupational exposure to HIV (health care workers and researchers working with HIV infected individuals or tissues or blood products containing the HIV virus); individuals with high-risk sexual behavior (multiple sexual partners, unprotected intercourse), or who practice needle-sharing; anyone requesting HIV testing; individuals with active tuberculosis, unexplained fevers, low white blood cell counts, or who have been diagnosed with a sexually-transmitted infection; and routine Screening is gaining more and more support as HIV is becoming a treatable disease. Theoretically, early treatment with anti-HIV medications may help the body's immune system fight the virus. So far, early treatment cannot cure or eradicate the virus. Therefore, early detection is most important to prevent the spread of the virus. Early detection, if it leads to life style changes , can also decrease the spread of the disease. The virus is present in the blood, genital, and other body secretions of virtually all infected individuals, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms. The HIV virus is spread from one person to another when these secretions come in contact with the vagina, anal area, mouth, or eyes, or with a break in the skin, such as from a cut, bruise, sore, or puncture by a needle. Sexual transmission of HIV has been described from men to men, men to women, women to men, and women to women through vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Abstinence from sex until both partners are certain that they are not infected (for example both partners test negative for HIV antibody after the last potential exposure). While most newly infected individuals test positive by two months after infection, up to 5% are still negative after six months with routine testing. If abstinence is not possible, use latex barriers such as a condoms and a dental dam (piece of latex that prevents vaginal secretions from coming in direct contact with the mouth.) Avoid sharing of needles, razor blades, and toothbrushes. Health care workers who experience a needle stick or exposure of the eyes, mouth, or injured skin from an infected person must take anti-HIV medication in order to reduce the risk of developing infection."
Cancer of colon and rectum/polyps of colon and rectum,"'Colorectal cancer'' is the second most common cause of death from ''cancer'' overall, and ranks third in both women (after lung and ''breast cancer'') and men (after lung and ''prostate cancer'').''Scientists believe that majority of the colon ''cancers'' develop from ''colon polyps'' (''precancerous'' growths on the inner surface of the colon). After turning cancerous, the cells can then invade or spread (''metastasize'') to other parts of the body. If these polyps are identified and removed before they turn cancerous, ''colon cancer'' can be prevented. Colon ''cancer'' is curable if it is surgically removed before the ''cancer'' spreads.''Stool occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy are documented to reduce colon cancer mortality by:' Stool occult blood test: A fecal occult blood test is a chemical test to detect trace amounts of blood in stool. It is inexpensive and easy, though not always accurate. Some cancers are not detected with this test, and many positive tests are due to conditions other than cancer.  Flexible sigmoidoscopy: A flexible sigmoidoscopy is a relatively quick and easy office procedure that allows direct visualization and biopsy of suspicious lesions from the distal (end) portion of the colon. The drawbacks include some discomfort and is not as thorough as colonoscopy.  Optical colonoscopy:Optical colonoscopy is the isualization of the entire colon. This is the most complete and thorough test, but often requires IV sedation, much more expensive, and is not covered by some insurance for screening.  Virtual colonoscopy:Virtual colonoscopy is a less invasive procedure utilizing CT scan to construct virtual images of the colon that are similar to the views of the colon obtained by direct colonoscopy. The drawbacks to virtual colonoscopy are that it cannot remove polyps, and is not as reliable as optical colonoscopy in detecting small polyps, finding flat cancers, or polyps that are not protruding. All healthy adults should have stool occult blood tests and flexible 
sigmoidoscopy at age 50 and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years.  Alternatively, instead of flexible sigmoidoscopy, all healthy persons can undergo screening colonoscopy at age 50 and then every 10 years if no prior history of polyps or cancer. Those at higher risk for colon cancer (individuals with family history of colon polyps and cancer, long standing ulcerative colitis, or prior personal history of colon polyps or cancer need colonoscopy earlier and at shorter intervals.

Prostate cancer,"'Prostate cancer'' is the most commonly occurring non-''skin cancer'' in men in the United States. Among the non-''skin cancers'', it is also the second most frequent cause of cancer death in this population.''Although screening tests (see below) are available, there is no scientific consensus on effective measures for reducing the incidence of prostate cancer. Additionally, there is no agreement on the effectiveness of screening or that the potential benefits of screening tests outweigh the risks.''The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of ''prostate cancer screening'' in men younger than age 75 years and that screening should not be carried out in men age 75 years or older.''The purpose of the screening is to detect early, tiny, or even microscopic cancers that are confined to the ''prostate gland''. Early treatment of these malignancies (cancers) can stop the growth, prevent the spread, and possibly cure the cancer. However, the evidence is not conclusive that screening and treatment of early and localized prostate cancer is beneficial; some elderly men may live with prostate cancer for many years and die from other conditions rather than from the prostate cancer, and the measures undertaken for diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer (surgery, ''radiation therapy'', ''chemotherapy'', or hormones) can have side effects and serious complications such as ''pain'' associated with the biopsy procedure, ''erectile dysfunction'', ''urinary incontinence'', bowel dysfunction, and death. For this reason, screening of men over age 75 years is not recommended, and younger men must consider the potential benefits and risks of ''prostate cancer screening'' and discuss these with their health care practitioner before undergoing screening tests.'

'""The American Academy of Ophthalmology's recommended intervals for eye exams, including ""'glaucoma'' screening, are:' A check-up for vision does not always measure intra-ocular pressure.  Measurement of intra-ocular pressure should be a standard component of a comprehensive eye examination. Age 20-29: Individuals of African descent or with a family history of glaucoma should have an eye examination every three to five years. Others should have an eye exam at least once during this period.  Age 30-39: Individuals of African descent or with a family history of glaucoma should have an eye examination every two to four years. Others should have an eye exam at least twice during this period.  Age 40-64: Every two to four years.  Age 65 or older: Every one to two years.  Glaucoma causes extensive damage to the retina and irreversible loss of vision without waning symptoms and before the individual becomes aware of loss of vision.  There is good evidence that treatment of elevated eye pressure in glaucoma can prevent blindness."
Melanoma and other skin cancers,"'Melanoma'' is the most serious form of ''skin cancer''The American Cancer Society recommends a skin check every 3 years between the ages of 20 and 40, and a skin check annually over age 40.''Adults with higher than normal risk for ''melanoma'' should be particularly vigilant to include individuals who:''See a doctor if the mole has the following characteristics:''Skin cancer'' is the most common cancer.

Bladder cancer,"'All individuals who are former or current ''cigarette'' ''smokers'' or who have a history of occupational exposure to certain chemicals often used in the dye, leather, tire and rubber industries should have a urine examination for blood periodically after age 60.' Urine examination for blood cells. This may be done by dipstick tests with confirmation by microscopic examination of the urine, or by initial microscopic examination.  Bladder cancer can cause either gross hematuria (visible blood in the urine) or microscopic hematuria (blood in the urine only visible with a microscope). It is important to note that bladder cancer is only one of many causes of blood in the urine.  Early bladder cancer may produce no symptoms and no visible bleeding in the urine, and blood in the urine commonly microscopic.  Treatment can be effective if the cancer is detected early, and survival is strongly associated with stage of disease at time of treatment.  Cessation of cigarette smoking is always advisable."

Following is a list of diseases for which screening is recommended along with mention of the commonly used screening tests, which usually are safe and simple and can help detect many diseases before they become harmful.'

High blood pressure (hypertension),"'About one-sixth of all Americans have ''high blood pressure'' and the incidence of this disease increases with age. African-Americans are more likely than other races to have ''high blood pressure''.''High blood pressure'' can cause arterial disease (''atherosclerosis'') that can lead to ''heart attack'', ''congestive heart failure'', ''stroke'', and ''kidney failure''.' High blood pressure: systolic >140, and/or diastolic >90  Borderline high blood pressure: systolic 130-140, and/or diastolic 85-90 How often blood pressure should be checked depends on how severely elevated the blood pressure is, and also depends on the number of other heart attack and stroke risk factors that are present. Adults with most recent normal blood pressure of systolic <130 and diastolic <85 should be checked at least every other year. Adults with borderline high blood pressures (systolic 130-140 or diastolic 85-90) should be rechecked in 3-6 months. High blood pressure can cause arterial disease (atherosclerosis) that can lead to heart attack, congestive heart failure, stroke, and kidney failure. High blood pressure can cause diseases without any early warning symptoms. There is good evidence that treatment of high blood pressure can reduce the risk of heart diseases, stroke, and kidney failure. There is good evidence that adults with borderline blood pressures can benefit from blood pressure lowering. Therefore, you should discuss with your doctor measures that you can take to reduce blood pressure, which can include reducing salt intake, exercise, and stress management."
"Hypercholesterolemia (hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia)","'Elevated ''LDL cholesterol'' or low ''HDL cholesterol'' increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis (""''hardening of the arteries''""). Atherosclerosis can begin to develop in adolescence and progress without any symptoms for many years and it leads to heart attack and stroke later in life.''Hyperlipidemia'' is a common and treatable cause of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of death in both men and women in developed countries. The goal is to diagnose and retard or reverse atherosclerosis while it is still in a silent early state before complications occur.'  total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, ""bad"" cholesterol,  HDL cholesterol, ""good"" cholesterol, total/HDL cholesterol ratio, and  triglycerides. All adults over 20 should have a lipid panel every 5 years if LDL cholesterol is less than 130, and every 1-3 years if LDL cholesterol is borderline (between 130 and 160). LDL is the part of the cholesterol panel that is most significant when determining treatment, as well as determining how often lipid panels should be checked. Tests may be carried out more frequently in those with risk factors for heart or vascular disease or when medically indicated. Elevated LDL cholesterol or low HDL cholesterol increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries). Atherosclerosis can begin to develop in adolescence and progress without any symptoms for many years. It leads to heart attack and stroke later in life. There is good evidence that lowering elevated or borderline LDL cholesterol and increasing low HDL is beneficial in heart attack prevention and in some cases stroke prevention in subjects with or without known atherosclerosis. Treatment of elevated or borderline cholesterol is multi-dimensional. Individuals should discuss potential treatments with their doctor, including nutritional planning (regarding total calorie, total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol intake) as well as weight reduction and regular exercise. "
Type II diabetes mellitus,"'Diabetes mellitus'' is a condition with elevated blood ''sugar'' level (''hyperglycemia'') due to impaired utilization of ''insulin'', decreased production of insulin, or both.''Diabetes'' is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. An estimated 18% of all Americans over 65 years of age have ''diabetes''. Over ten million Americans have been diagnosed with ''diabetes'', and at least half as many more are thought to have diabetes that is undiagnosed. Many more have a condition that precedes diabetes, referred to as ''prediabetes'', characterized by elevated blood ''sugar'' levels but to a lesser degree than is present in those with diabetes.''Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases of ''blindness'' in adults aged 20-74 years, the leading cause of chronic kidney failure, and the leading cause of lower extremity amputations not related to injury. Individuals with diabetes are two to four times as likely to have a heart attack or stroke as are those without diabetes.''Healthy adults over 45 years should have ''fasting blood glucose'' level checked every 3 years.''Adults at a higher than normal risk of developing diabetes mellitus should be checked more frequently than every three years; these individuals include:' Fasting blood sugar (blood sugar test after at least 8 hours without calories), normal level less than 126 mg/dl  Two hour postprandial blood sugar (blood sugar test 2 hours after a meal), normal level less than 140mg/dl People who are overweight  Blood relatives with type II diabetes  Certain ethnic groups such as certain Native Americans, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asians Individuals with prediabetes Low HDL cholesterol (35 mg/dl. or less) or elevated triglyceride level (over 250 mg/dl) Diabetes mellitus can cause atherosclerosis that can lead to heart attack, stroke, and compromise of arterial circulation to the legs and feet. Diabetes mellitus also can damage the nerves, eyes, and kidneys.  Diabetes mellitus commonly causes organ damage without symptoms until extensive damage is present.  There is good evidence that controlling hyperglycemia in diabetes with medications, diet, weight control, and regular exercise can slow the development of atherosclerosis and heart, eye, nerve, and kidney damage.  There is good evidence that curtailing total calorie intake (especially intake of processed starches, sugar and sweets), regular exercise, and losing excess weight can help prevent the development of type II diabetes mellitus, especially in adults at higher than normal risk of developing diabetes."
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus),"'HIV'' is the virus that causes ''AIDS'' (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). While modern anti-''HIV'' medications have significantly improved long-term survival and quality of life of ''HIV'' infected individuals, there is still no cure or ''vaccine''. HIV infection is still eventually lethal in everyone who is infected. Therefore, preventing the spread of HIV is the most important step in preventing illness and death due to HIV infection.''The following individuals should be routinely offered HIV testing:''Most infected individuals will develop a positive HIV blood test within 3 months of being exposed to HIV. If the ''HIV test'' at 3 months is negative and there are risk factors for infection, the test should be repeated in another 3 months.' Screening blood test for antibodies to HIV is called an ELISA test. Confirmatory test for antibodies to HIV is called a Western blot. HIV-infected individuals can remain free of symptoms for many years; they will know if they are infected ONLY if a blood test for HIV is done. HIV testing can be performed by a physician or at a testing center. pregnant women; individuals with occupational exposure to HIV (health care workers and researchers working with HIV infected individuals or tissues or blood products containing the HIV virus); individuals with high-risk sexual behavior (multiple sexual partners, unprotected intercourse), or who practice needle-sharing; anyone requesting HIV testing; individuals with active tuberculosis, unexplained fevers, low white blood cell counts, or who have been diagnosed with a sexually-transmitted infection; and routine Screening is gaining more and more support as HIV is becoming a treatable disease. Theoretically, early treatment with anti-HIV medications may help the body's immune system fight the virus. So far, early treatment cannot cure or eradicate the virus. Therefore, early detection is most important to prevent the spread of the virus. Early detection, if it leads to life style changes , can also decrease the spread of the disease. The virus is present in the blood, genital, and other body secretions of virtually all infected individuals, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms. The HIV virus is spread from one person to another when these secretions come in contact with the vagina, anal area, mouth, or eyes, or with a break in the skin, such as from a cut, bruise, sore, or puncture by a needle. Sexual transmission of HIV has been described from men to men, men to women, women to men, and women to women through vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Abstinence from sex until both partners are certain that they are not infected (for example both partners test negative for HIV antibody after the last potential exposure). While most newly infected individuals test positive by two months after infection, up to 5% are still negative after six months with routine testing. If abstinence is not possible, use latex barriers such as a condoms and a dental dam (piece of latex that prevents vaginal secretions from coming in direct contact with the mouth.) Avoid sharing of needles, razor blades, and toothbrushes. Health care workers who experience a needle stick or exposure of the eyes, mouth, or injured skin from an infected person must take anti-HIV medication in order to reduce the risk of developing infection."
Cancer of colon and rectum/polyps of colon and rectum,"'Colorectal cancer'' is the second most common cause of death from ''cancer'' overall, and ranks third in both women (after lung and ''breast cancer'') and men (after lung and ''prostate cancer'').''Scientists believe that majority of the colon ''cancers'' develop from ''colon polyps'' (''precancerous'' growths on the inner surface of the colon). After turning cancerous, the cells can then invade or spread (''metastasize'') to other parts of the body. If these polyps are identified and removed before they turn cancerous, ''colon cancer'' can be prevented. Colon ''cancer'' is curable if it is surgically removed before the ''cancer'' spreads.''Stool occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy are documented to reduce colon cancer mortality by:' Stool occult blood test: A fecal occult blood test is a chemical test to detect trace amounts of blood in stool. It is inexpensive and easy, though not always accurate. Some cancers are not detected with this test, and many positive tests are due to conditions other than cancer.  Flexible sigmoidoscopy: A flexible sigmoidoscopy is a relatively quick and easy office procedure that allows direct visualization and biopsy of suspicious lesions from the distal (end) portion of the colon. The drawbacks include some discomfort and is not as thorough as colonoscopy.  Optical colonoscopy:Optical colonoscopy is the isualization of the entire colon. This is the most complete and thorough test, but often requires IV sedation, much more expensive, and is not covered by some insurance for screening.  Virtual colonoscopy:Virtual colonoscopy is a less invasive procedure utilizing CT scan to construct virtual images of the colon that are similar to the views of the colon obtained by direct colonoscopy. The drawbacks to virtual colonoscopy are that it cannot remove polyps, and is not as reliable as optical colonoscopy in detecting small polyps, finding flat cancers, or polyps that are not protruding. All healthy adults should have stool occult blood tests and flexible 
sigmoidoscopy at age 50 and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years.  Alternatively, instead of flexible sigmoidoscopy, all healthy persons can undergo screening colonoscopy at age 50 and then every 10 years if no prior history of polyps or cancer. Those at higher risk for colon cancer (individuals with family history of colon polyps and cancer, long standing ulcerative colitis, or prior personal history of colon polyps or cancer need colonoscopy earlier and at shorter intervals.  Preventing colon cancer by identifying and removing polyps before they become cancerous; and Increasing the cancer cure rate by identifying early cancer at a treatable stage before the cancer has spread (metastasized)."
Prostate cancer,"'Prostate cancer'' is the most commonly occurring non-''skin cancer'' in men in the United States. Among the non-''skin cancers'', it is also the second most frequent cause of cancer death in this population.''Although screening tests (see below) are available, there is no scientific consensus on effective measures for reducing the incidence of prostate cancer. Additionally, there is no agreement on the effectiveness of screening or that the potential benefits of screening tests outweigh the risks.''The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of ''prostate cancer screening'' in men younger than age 75 years and that screening should not be carried out in men age 75 years or older.''The purpose of the screening is to detect early, tiny, or even microscopic cancers that are confined to the ''prostate gland''. Early treatment of these malignancies (cancers) can stop the growth, prevent the spread, and possibly cure the cancer. However, the evidence is not conclusive that screening and treatment of early and localized prostate cancer is beneficial; some elderly men may live with prostate cancer for many years and die from other conditions rather than from the prostate cancer, and the measures undertaken for diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer (surgery, ''radiation therapy'', ''chemotherapy'', or hormones) can have side effects and serious complications such as ''pain'' associated with the biopsy procedure, ''erectile dysfunction'', ''urinary incontinence'', bowel dysfunction, and death. For this reason, screening of men over age 75 years is not recommended, and younger men must consider the potential benefits and risks of ''prostate cancer screening'' and discuss these with their health care practitioner before undergoing screening tests.'  Digital rectal examination (DRE)  PSA (prostate specific antigen) blood test"
Glaucoma,"'Glaucoma'' is a condition with abnormally elevated intra-''ocular'' pressures (pressure within the eyes.) ''Tonometry'':'' (eye pressure measurements) an ''eye care'' specialist\xa0 is required for adequate examination. '""The American Academy of Ophthalmology's recommended intervals for eye exams, including ""'glaucoma'' screening, are:' A check-up for vision does not always measure intra-ocular pressure.  Measurement of intra-ocular pressure should be a standard component of a comprehensive eye examination. Age 20-29: Individuals of African descent or with a family history of glaucoma should have an eye examination every three to five years. Others should have an eye exam at least once during this period.  Age 30-39: Individuals of African descent or with a family history of glaucoma should have an eye examination every two to four years. Others should have an eye exam at least twice during this period.  Age 40-64: Every two to four years.  Age 65 or older: Every one to two years.  Glaucoma causes extensive damage to the retina and irreversible loss of vision without waning symptoms and before the individual becomes aware of loss of vision.  There is good evidence that treatment of elevated eye pressure in glaucoma can prevent blindness."
Melanoma and other skin cancers,"'Melanoma'' is the most serious form of ''skin cancer''The American Cancer Society recommends a skin check every 3 years between the ages of 20 and 40, and a skin check annually over age 40.''Adults with higher than normal risk for ''melanoma'' should be particularly vigilant to include individuals who:''See a doctor if the mole has the following characteristics:''Skin cancer'' is the most common cancer. Even though the benefit of skin ''cancer screening'' is uncertain (so far research has not shown that death from ''skin cancer'' can be decreased after a regular screening program is instituted), early treatment of skin cancer can be effective. Melanomas may be detected at a thinner stage with regular skin exams. Thinner melanomas are more successfully treated than are thick ones that have grown downward into the deeper portions of the skin.'  Total body skin examination have a family history of melanoma; are middle-aged adults with frequent sun exposure; have a history of serious or frequent sunburn (childhood sunburn is particularly risky); have more than 50 moles; and have fair skin. diameter more than 6mm; asymmetric (meaning an uneven shape); irregular border; and variable color pattern, meaning many colors or unusual colors, such as blue or black."
Bladder cancer,"'All individuals who are former or current ''cigarette'' ''smokers'' or who have a history of occupational exposure to certain chemicals often used in the dye, leather, tire and rubber industries should have a urine examination for blood periodically after age 60.' Urine examination for blood cells. This may be done by dipstick tests with confirmation by microscopic examination of the urine, or by initial microscopic examination.  Bladder cancer can cause either gross hematuria (visible blood in the urine) or microscopic hematuria (blood in the urine only visible with a microscope). It is important to note that bladder cancer is only one of many causes of blood in the urine.  Early bladder cancer may produce no symptoms and no visible bleeding in the urine, and blood in the urine commonly microscopic.  Treatment can be effective if the cancer is detected early, and survival is strongly associated with stage of disease at time of treatment.  Cessation of cigarette smoking is always advisable."
What are night sweats?,"'Doctors in primary care fields of medicine often hear their patients complain of night sweats because they are common. Night sweats refer to any excess\xa0''sweating''\xa0occurring during the night. However, if you keep your bedroom temperature unusually hot or you are sleeping in too many clothes, you may sweat during your\xa0''sleep'"", which is normal. In order to distinguish night sweats that arise from medical causes from those that occur because one's surroundings are too warm, doctors generally refer to true night sweats as severe\xa0""'hot flashes''\xa0occurring at night that can drench sleepwear and sheets, which are not related to an overheated environment.''In one study of 2267 patients visiting a primary care doctor, 41% reported experiencing night sweats during the previous month, so the perception of\xa0''excessive sweating''\xa0at night is common. It is important to note that flushing (a warmth and redness of the face or trunk) also may be hard to distinguish from true night sweats.' "
What are other signs and symptoms of night sweats?,"'Depending upon the underlying cause of the night sweats, other symptoms may occur in association with the ''sweating''. For example:' Certain infections and cancers Shaking and chills can sometimes occur if you have a fever. Unexplained weight loss due to lymphoma. Night sweats due to the menopausal transition are typically accompanied by other symptoms of menopause such as vaginal dryness, daytime hot flashes, and mood changes. Night sweats that occur as a side effect of medications can be accompanied by other medication side effects, depending upon the specific drug. Conditions that result in increased sweating in general (as opposed to only night sweats) will result in increased sweating at other hours of the day."

Perimenopause and Menopause,'The hot flashes that accompany the menopausal transition can occur at night and cause sweating. This is a very common cause of night sweats in perimenopausal women. It is important to remember that hot flashes and other symptoms of the ''perimenopause'' can precede the actual ''menopause'' (the cessation of menstrual periods) by several years.'  
Hormone disorders,"'Sweating or flushing can be seen with several hormone disorders, including ''pheochromocytoma'' (a type of ''adrenal gland tumor'' that overproduces hormones known as catecholamines), ''carcinoid syndrome'' (overproduction of certain hormones by tumors of the lung or gastrointestinal system), and ''hyperthyroidism'' (excessive levels of thyroid hormones).' "
Idiopathic hyperhidrosis,'Idiopathic ''hyperhidrosis'' is a condition in which the body chronically produces too much sweat without any identifiable medical cause.' 
Infections,"'Classically, ''tuberculosis'' is the infection most commonly associated with night sweats. However, ''bacterial infections'', such as the following conditions can also be associated with night sweats:' endocarditis (inflammation of the heart valves), osteomyelitis (inflammation within the bones due to infection), abscesses (for example, boils, appendix, tonsils, perianal, peritonsillar, diverticulitis), and AIDS virus (HIV) infection."
Cancers,"'Night sweats are an early symptom of some cancers. The most common type of\xa0''cancer''\xa0associated with night sweats is lymphoma. However, people who have an undiagnosed\xa0''cancer''\xa0frequently have other symptoms as well, such as unexplained ''weight loss'' and fever.' "
Antidepressants,"'Taking certain medications can lead to night sweats. In cases without other physical symptoms or signs of ''tumor'' or infection, medications are often determined to be the cause of night sweats.''Antidepressant'' medications are a common type of medication that can lead to night sweats. All types of ''antidepressants'' including ''tricyclic antidepressants'', selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and the newer agents, ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor'') and ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin'') can cause night sweats as a side effect, with a range in incidence from 8% to 22% of persons taking antidepressant ''drugs''.

Facts and Definition of Meniere's disease," Meniere's disease is a disorder of the flow of fluids of the inner ear. Symptoms of Meniere's disease often fluctuate and include ringing, ear fullness, hearing loss, and poor equilibrium. Diagnosis of Meniere's disease is usually based on history and exam, though other tests can be used. Treatments for Meniere's disease may include diet and life style changes, medications, and surgery."
What is Meniere's disease?,"""Meniere's disease is a disorder of the flow of fluids of the inner ear. "" "
What causes Meniere's disease?,"""Although the cause of Meniere's disease is unknown, it probably results from an abnormality in the way fluid of the inner ear is regulated."" In most cases only one ear is involved, but both ears may be affected in about 15% of patients. Meniere's disease typically starts between the ages of 20 and 50 years of age (although it has been reported in nearly all age groups). Men and women are equally affected. The symptoms may be only a minor nuisance or can become disabling, especially if the attacks of vertigo are severe, frequent, and occur without warning. Meniere's disease is also called idiopathic endolymphatic hydrops."
What are the symptoms of Meniere's disease?,"""The symptoms of Meniere's disease typically include at least several of the following:""   Episodic rotational vertigo: Attacks of a spinning sensation accompanied by disequilibrium (an off-balanced sensation), nausea, and sometimes vomiting. This is usually the most troublesome symptom. The vertigo usually last 20 minutes to four hours or longer. During attacks, patients are very disabled, and sleepiness may follow. An off-balanced sensation may last for several days.  Tinnitus: A roaring, buzzing, machine-like, or ringing sound in the ear. It may be episodic with an attack of vertigo or it may be constant. Usually the tinnitus gets worse or will appear just before the onset of the vertigo. Hearing loss: It may be intermittent early in the onset of the disease, but overtime it may become a fixed hearing loss. It may involve all frequencies, but most commonly occurs in the lower frequencies. Loud sounds may be uncomfortable and appear distorted in the affected ear.  Ear fullness: Usually this full feeling occurs just before the onset of an attack of vertigo. "
How is Meniere's disease diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis of Meniere's disease is primarily made from the history and physical examination. Tinnitus or ear fullness (aural fullness) need to be present to make the diagnosis An audiogram is helpful to show a hearing loss, and to rule-out other abnormalities. It is often helpful, if it can be done safely, to have an audiogram during or immediately following an attack of vertigo. This may show the characteristic low frequency hearing loss. As the disease progresses hearing loss usually worsens.""'Other tests such as the auditory brain stem response (ABR), a computerized test of the hearing nerves and brain pathways, computer tomography (''CT scan'') or, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') may be needed to rule out a ''tumor'"" occurring on the hearing or balance nerve. These tumors are rare, but they can cause symptoms similar to Meniere's disease. A full neurological evaluation is performed to exclude other causes of vertigo."" "
How can Meniere's disease be treated?,"""Although there is no real cure for Meniere's disease, the attacks of vertigo can be controlled in nearly all cases. If you have vertigo without warning, you should not drive, because failure to control the vehicle may be hazardous to yourself and to others. Safety may require you to forego ladders, scaffolds, and ""'swimming''.'   Medications: A diuretic (water pill) such as triamterene (Dyazide, Maxzide) combined with a low salt diet, is the primary treatment of Meniere's disease. Anti-vertigo medications such as meclizine (Antivert, Bonine, Meni-D, Antrizine) mask the symptoms, providing relief, or diazepam (Valium) may provide temporary relief during more severe attacks of vertigo. Anti-nausea medications [for example, promethazine (Phenergan)] sometimes also are prescribed. In some cases, steroids and certain antibiotic medications (gentamicin) injected into the middle ear may provide some relief from vertigo symptoms. Both anti-vertigo and anti-nausea medications may cause drowsiness. Because the nausea can be so severe at times, medications may be prescribed in the form of a suppository Air pulse generator: in some patients, periodic delivery of small air pulses transmitted through a tube placed in the ear drum has had some variable success. Surgery: If vertigo attacks are not controlled medically and are disabling, for a minority of patients, one of the following surgical procedures may be recommended depending on the individual patient's situation:endolymphatic shunt (A surgical procedure in which a shunt (tube) is placed in the endolymphatic sac that drains excess fluid from the ear.)selective vestibular neurectomylabyrinthectomy (surgical removal of the labyrinth of the ear) and eighth nerve section. endolymphatic shunt (A surgical procedure in which a shunt (tube) is placed in the endolymphatic sac that drains excess fluid from the ear.) selective vestibular neurectomy labyrinthectomy (surgical removal of the labyrinth of the ear) and eighth nerve section."

What is meningitis?,"'Meningitis'' is inflammation of the membranes (meninges) that surround the brain and the spinal cord. The usual signs and ''symptoms of meningitis'' are ''headache'', ''fever'', and a ''stiff neck''. There are many types of ''meningitis''. Often meningitis is named according to the cause. For example, there are viral, bacterial, noninfectious (aseptic), and many other types of meningitis.' "
Is meningitis contagious?,"'The contagiousness is related to the specific agent that causes the disease. The following is a summary of five types of meningitis and how they may or may not be ''contagious''.' Viral meningitis: Meningitis caused by many viruses is usually contagious. However, certain viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes are usually not spread person to person, so they are not contagious. Bacterial meningitis: Bacterial meningitis is usually contagious; some bacteria more highly contagious (such as Neisseria meningitidis in young adults and Streptococcus pneumoniae in all ages) than others. Fungal meningitis: Fungal meningitis (for example, Cryptococcus meningitis) is not considered to be contagious. Parasitic meningitis: Parasitic meningitis, which is rare (for example, Naegleria fowleri), is not considered to be contagious from person to person. Noninfectious meningitis: Noninfectious meningitis is not a result of infection but is from an underlying condition or disease and not considered contagious. Causes of noninfectious meningitis include cancers in and around the brain or spinal cord, drugs, head injury, and autoimmune disease (such as lupus or Behçet's disease)."
How contagious is meningitis?,"'In short, most bacterial meningitis infections are mildly to moderately contagious person to person, while some viral meningitis are contagious but other types are not. Fungal, parasitic, and noninfectious causes of meningitis are not contagious from one person directly to another.' "
How long is meningitis contagious?,"'This depends upon which infectious agents are causing the meningitis. In general, when the patient is secreting or producing viruses or bacteria, they are considered contagious. When the patient stops secreting or producing infectious agents is when meningitis is no longer contagious. Viral caused meningitis may be contagious from three days after infection starts to about 10 days after the symptoms develop. Bacterial meningitis is usually less contagious than viral; depending on the bacterial genus causing the infection, it may be contagious during the incubation period and for about an additional seven to 14 days. And they can be contagious for much longer (many days to months) if the person becomes a carrier. The contagious period may be shortened with antibiotic treatments.' "
What is the incubation period for meningitis?,"'The incubation period for bacterial meningitis, the most serious types of meningitis, is about three to five days after initial contact with the microbe. However, in some individuals, bacterial ''meningitis symptoms'' can occur as rapidly as 24 hours. For viral meningitis, the incubation period can range widely from only a few days to a few weeks. Patients who get meningitis usually have symptoms of ''headache'', ''fever'', and a ''stiff neck''. They may also develop ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', ''photophobia'', and alteration of their mental state. Children with meningitis may appear to be lethargic, drowsy, have a high-pitched cry, may develop a ''rash'', and dislike being held.''Besides the history and physical exam, the physician is likely to do a ''spinal tap'' to analyze spinal fluid to detect the agent involved. Bacteria, viruses, or other agents may be identified by subsequent tests of the spinal fluid, including microscopic identification, culture, and immunological tests. In addition, blood and urine samples are also analyzed. Identification of the precise microbe allows the physician to diagnose the type of meningitis and proceed with accurate treatments.' "
How does meningitis spread?,"'Meningitis is transmitted to people by many methods. Both bacterial and viral meningitis are spread person to person similarly. Person-to-person spread can happen with direct and indirect contact between individuals (''coughing'' up droplets, contact with the feces, ''sneezing'', saliva, kissing, or eating contaminated food). Indirect spread by using the same utensils, cups, and other items used by an infected individual can also spread the disease to others. Some ''fungal infections'' are transmitted by airborne dust particles. In addition, other types of meningitis can be transferred to humans by vectors such as mosquitoes (for example, ''West Nile virus'') or ''ticks'' (''Lyme disease'').' "
How long does meningitis last?,"'Viral meningitis lasts about seven to 10 days with symptoms receding gradually. Bacterial meningitis is usually cured by antibiotics. The time to cure varies with each individual and corresponds with the decrease of symptoms. If bacterial meningitis is not treated rapidly with antibiotics, there can be long-term injury to the brain and even death.' "
When should someone seek medical care for meningitis?,"'Individuals should contact a medical ''caregiver'' immediately about meningitis if they suspect that they have been exposed to bacterial meningitis. Meningitis, especially bacterial meningitis, is considered a medical emergency; if an individual develops early ''symptoms of meningitis'' (high ''fever'', ''headache'', and/or ''neck stiffness'') or becomes ill after contacting an individual known to have contagious meningitis, he or she should seek medical care emergently. Bacterial meningitis has about a 10% death rate unless it is treated early in the infection.''Infants with meningitis may develop a firm or bulging soft spot on the head. Other problems that can develop at any age are ''seizures'', altered consciousness, and difficulty ''breathing''. Individuals with these symptoms should immediately go to an emergency department. If an infant or child exhibits such serious ''meningitis symptoms'', if possible, seek a hospital that offers pediatric ''emergency medicine''.' "
What is meningitis?,"'Meningitis is inflammation of the membranes (meninges) that surround the brain and spinal cord. The term ''encephalitis'' refers to inflammation of the brain itself. This may simply be a progression of meningitis or occur at the same time, depending on the cause. Sometimes this is referred to as ''meningoencephalitis''.' "
What is encephalomyelitis?,"'Encephalomyelitis'' is inflammation of both the brain and spinal cord. Encephalomyelitis can be caused by a variety of conditions that lead to irritation of the brain and spinal cord. Among the common causes of encephalomyelitis are viruses that infect the nervous tissues (for example, ''herpes'' simplex and ''varicella zoster virus''). People with encephalomyelitis can exhibit combinations of the various symptoms of either encephalitis or meningitis.' "
What causes meningitis?,"'Meningitis may be caused by infectious or non-infectious conditions. Many different viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites can cause meningitis. Diseases that can trigger inflammation of tissues of the body without infection (such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'' and '""Behçet's disease""') may cause aseptic (non-bacterial) meningitis. Certain ''drugs'' may cause aseptic meningitis, most commonly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDS'', for example, ''ibuprofen'') or the antibiotic ''trimethoprim''-''sulfamethoxazole''.' "
What are meningitis symptoms and signs?,"'The classic signs and symptoms of meningitis are'""Signs a health professional will look for when examining for meningitis include Kernig and Brudzinski signs. Kernig's sign is tested for as follows: With the patient lying flat on the back, the leg is bent 90 degrees at the hip and the knee bent 90 degrees. From this position, the examiner straightens the leg at the knee. If there is strong resistance to straightening the bent knee with the hip bent at 90 degrees, it suggests meningitis. Brudzinski's sign is tested for as follows: With the patient lying flat on the back and legs flat on the bed, the examiner bends the head forward at the neck. If this makes the legs pull up and bend at the knee, it suggests meningitis.""'Symptoms of meningitis may appear suddenly and also include''In infants, symptoms of meningitis are often much less specific and may include''Especially early in the disease, meningitis can have symptoms similar to the ''flu''. Some types of meningitis can be deadly if not treated promptly. Anyone experiencing symptoms of meningitis should see a doctor immediately.' headache, fever (usually high, but may be low-grade), stiff neck (in adults and older children), and painful sensitivity to light (photophobia). nausea, vomiting, and changes in behavior, such as confusion, sleepiness, and difficulty waking up. irritability or tiredness, poor feeding, and fever."
What are the types of meningitis?,"'Meningitis may be acute (sudden and short illness) or chronic (slowly starting and long-lasting). Infectious types of meningitis include bacterial meningitis, viral meningitis, ''fungal meningitis'', and parasitic meningitis.''Most infectious meningitis is community acquired. Very rarely, fungal or bacterial meningitis may be acquired from a hospital or medical procedure. For example, in 2015, over 200 cases of fungal meningitis were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The unusual outbreak was linked to tainted steroid medication that was improperly prepared by the New England Compounding Pharmacy.''Viral infection is the most common infectious cause of community-acquired viral meningitis. Most acute viral meningitis (a type of aseptic meningitis) is caused by summer viruses like ''enterovirus''. It is usually not severe. It generally runs its course and goes away without specific treatment. Viral meningitis usually does not cause long-lasting complications or problems. Other community-acquired causes of viral meningitis include ''influenza'', ''measles'', and ''mumps''. Viruses spread by insect bites include the ''West Nile virus''; these viruses often cause meningitis and encephalomyelitis.''Less commonly, herpes simplex viruses, which cause ''cold sores'' or ''genital herpes'', can cause viral meningoencephalitis. ''Hallucinations'' may be an especially prominent symptom. ''Varicella'' zoster virus (the cause of ''chickenpox'', as well as ''herpes zoster'' or ''shingles'') may also cause meningoencephalitis. These infections may arise from newly acquired virus or reactivation of virus that infected the body years ago.''Acute bacterial meningitis causes over 4,000 cases and 500 deaths per year in the U.S. A common cause is ''Streptococcus'' pneumoniae'' (pneumococcus), which causes over 50% of cases in the U.S. (about 2,000 per year). It is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in young children under 5 in the U.S., although immunization with pneumococcal conjugate ''vaccine'' has reduced the rate of infection. Pneumococcal meningitis may be complicated by ''pneumonia'' (lung infection), bloodstream infection, ''sepsis'', and long-term problems like permanent ''hearing loss'' or ''brain damage''. Up to 8% of children and 22% of adults who develop the condition die from it.''Neisseria meningitidis'' (''meningococcus'') is known for causing meningococcal disease (bloodstream infection, sepsis) and bacterial meningitis. ''Meningococcal meningitis'' is life threatening and rapidly progressive. Although pneumococcus can do the same, this is the type of meningitis most likely to cause ''gangrene'' and amputations of limbs. Up to 15% of people with this infection will die. Up to 19% have long-term complications like permanent deafness or brain damage. It is most likely to occur in children under the age of 1 and youths ages 16 to 23 years, but people of any age may be affected. The most common serogroups (types of the virus that can be identified by antibody testing in the blood) to cause infection in the U.S. are A, C, W, and Y. Serogroup B is more common elsewhere. There is a higher risk of contact with a carrier of serogroup B in areas where groups congregate from many areas, like a college campus or traveling with a group of tourists.''Fortunately, advances in medical care mean that rates of meningococcal disease have been declining for the past few decades. Vaccination of ''teens'' added an 80% drop in infections with serogroup C, W, and Y strains. On average in the U.S., there are now 18 cases per thousand people per year. Adolescents are now routinely vaccinated in their early teens, and freshman college students must show proof of meningococcal vaccination before entry.''Less common causes of acute bacterial meningitis include ''Hemophilus influenzae'', which is now prevented very effectively by the Hib vaccine. Group B ''Streptococcus'' (GBS) causes life-threatening ''newborn'' meningitis and bloodstream infections. It may be spread to the baby during birth. Fortunately, women are screened for this bacterium at 35 to 37 weeks of ''pregnancy'' as part of routine maternal care. Those who have it will get antibiotics during delivery to prevent GBS disease and bacterial meningitis in the newborn.''A rarer cause but serious cause of bacterial meningitis, ''Listeria'' monocytogenes'', may cause meningitis in ''pregnant'' women, people over 50, and those with immune problems. It may cause mild illness in a pregnant woman only to cause severe infection of the fetus, with premature delivery and fetal death. It is acquired from unpasteurized, unaged soft cheeses, and deli meats.''Fungal causes of meningitis are usually limited to people with very weak immunity from medications, immune disorders, or advanced ''HIV'' disease. An exception is ''Coccidioides immitis'', which commonly causes ''valley fever'' in the American Southwest and can cause meningitis even if immunity is normal. ''Cryptococcus'' is a more common cause of fungal meningitis in people with weak immunity.''Rarer still are the parasitic causes of meningitis. Parasites often cause elevation of eosinophils, a specific type of inflammatory cell, in the blood or spinal fluid. Eosinophilic meningitis is caused by parasites that usually infect animals. Humans are accidental hosts for parasites such as''Angiostrongylus'' meningitis has been reported in Asia and the Pacific, including Hawaii, but infected snails have been reported in Florida, as well. Baylisascaris is most often diagnosed in the U.S. in children who play in areas frequented by raccoons and put their hands in their mouths. ''Gnathostoma'' meningitis is most commonly reported in Thailand.''Primary amoebic meningitis (''Naegleria fowleri'') and granulomatous meningoencephalitis (''Acanthamoeba'' species, ''Balamuthia mandrillaris'') are caused by amoeba found in water and soil. The organisms are forced up the nose in water (primary amoebic meningitis) or inhaled or enter via a break in the skin (granulomatous meningoencephalitis). All are highly fatal even with aggressive and prolonged treatment. Primary amoebic meningitis mimics acute bacterial meningitis in its symptoms and is often fatal within days; ''swimming'' in warm fresh water is the clue for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Granulomatous meningoencephalitis is often chronic.''Chronic meningitis lasts four weeks or longer and is fairly uncommon in the U.S. and developed countries. Most bacterial infection causes acute meningitis, but worldwide the most common cause of chronic meningitis is ''tuberculosis'' (''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''). Other causes include spirochete bacteria like ''syphilis'' and ''Lyme disease'', fungi like Cryptococcus, insect-borne viruses like ''West Nile virus'', herpes simplex virus, and varicella zoster virus.' Angiostrongylus cantonensis (by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs, often by accident, on leafy greens); Bayliscaris procyonis (by accidentally eating soil contaminated with raccoon feces); Gnathostoma spinigerum (by eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish, eels, frogs, chicken, or snakes); Toxoplasma gondii (by eating raw or undercooked pork, lamb, deer, or shellfish, or accidental ingestion of eggs from cat feces); and free-living amoebae like Naegleria fowleri, Acanthamoeba, and Balamuthia mandrillaris (through contact with warm water or soil)."
What are the risk factors for meningitis?,"'This depends on the type of meningitis. People with normal immunity but exposure to crowding, certain age groups, or certain activities may be at higher risk for certain types of meningitis. Patients with a suppressed immune system, either because of medications (organ transplant recipients, etc.) or from a disease that suppresses the immune system (''HIV'', for example), are at increased risk for less common bacteria, tuberculosis, as well as fungal meningitis.''Certain people are at higher risk of pneumococcal meningitis and should receive pneumococcal ''vaccines'', including the following:''Teens and young adults are at higher risk for invasive meningococcal disease, and routine vaccination of this age group is recommended with meningococcal conjugate vaccine, which covers the commonest serogroups in the U.S. (A, C, W, and Y). Certain people with immune problems are at higher risk for meningococcal disease and should also receive serogroup B ''meningococcal vaccine''. These include''Certain groups of people are more likely to be exposed to meningococcal disease. They can also benefit from vaccination with serogroup B meningococcal ''vaccines'':''Pregnant women and people over 50 years of age are at increased risk of meningitis from ''Listeria monocytogenes''. Other types of meningitis have risk factors due to specific exposures to soil, water, foods, and insect bites.' Tobacco smokers People with immune disorders like HIV People taking medications that suppress immunity People whose spleen is not working or had it removed (hyposplenia, asplenia, sickle cell disease) People who have had skull or facial fractures with leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) People who have a cochlear implant People with chronic lung, heart, or kidney conditions people whose spleen is not working or had it removed (hyposplenia, asplenia, sickle cell disease); people with specific immune disorders like deficiencies of complement, properdin, factor H or factor D; people living with HIV disease; and people who take eculizumab (Soliris) for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. People living in close and household contact with someone who has meningococcal meningitis People who may have been exposed during an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis Freshman college students living in on-campus group housing Military recruits living in group housing Travelers to areas where meningococcal meningitis is common (endemic). Sub-Saharan Africa during the dry season is known as the meningitis belt, and risk is high during the crowded annual Islamic pilgrimage (Hajj) to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. People who may be exposed to meningococcus in a laboratory"
How does meningitis spread?,"'This depends on the type of meningitis and the specific organism.''Classic community-acquired acute bacterial meningitis spreads from person to person, usually from respiratory droplets or saliva (spit). Meningococcus, pneumococcus, and ''H. influenzae'' are spread this way. Community-acquired acute viral meningitis usually spreads from person to person in saliva, respiratory droplets, or ''diarrhea''.''Group B ''Streptococcus'' spreads from mother to baby during vaginal delivery. People acquire ''Listeria monocytogenes'' from contaminated food.''Herpes and varicella are acquired from person to person and can reactivate several years after infection. Several encephalitis viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes.''Fungal meningitis is usually acquired from ''breathing'' fungal spores in the air.' "
What specialties of doctors treat meningitis?,"'Specialists who may be part of the team caring for someone with meningitis include: pediatricians, family practice or general internal medicine specialists, hospitalists or critical care (intensive care) specialists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, and infectious disease specialists.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose meningitis?,"'Meningitis is suspected when fever, ''headache'', and ''neck stiffness'"" are present. The doctor diagnoses meningitis after a completing a thorough history (asking the patient questions) and examination. The examination includes Brudzinski's and Kernig's maneuvers to detect signs of inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (meninges). Based on the history and examination, the doctor suggests specific tests to further help in determining the diagnosis.""'Tests that are used in the evaluation of individuals suspected of having meningitis include evaluation of the blood for signs of infection and possible presence of bacteria, brain scanning (such as CT scan or MRI scan), and cerebrospinal fluid analysis.''A lumbar puncture is the most common method of obtaining a sample of the fluid in the spinal canal (the cerebrospinal fluid or CSF) for examination. A lumbar puncture (LP) is the insertion of a needle into the fluid within the spinal canal. It is termed a ""lumbar puncture"" because the needle goes into the lumbar portion of the back (the lower portion of the back). The needle passes between the bony parts of the spine until it reaches the cerebral spinal fluid. A small amount of fluid is then collected and sent to the laboratory for examination. The evaluation of the spinal fluid is usually necessary for the definitive diagnosis and to help make optimal treatment decisions (such as the appropriate choice of antibiotics in the case of bacterial meningitis).''The diagnosis is confirmed by abnormal spinal fluid results and, in the case of an infection, by identifying the organism causing the infection. In patients with meningitis, the CSF fluid often has a low glucose (''sugar'') level and increased white blood cell count. In addition, the fluid can be used to identify some viral causes of meningitis (''PCR'' or ''polymerase chain reaction'') or be used to culture bacterial organisms causing the meningitis.' "
What is the treatment of meningitis?,"'There is no ''over-the-counter'' treatment or home remedy for meningitis. It is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical evaluation at an emergency department or hospital to determine the type of treatment. Antibiotic and/or antiviral medications need to be considered urgently when the diagnosis of acute meningitis is suspected. In the case of suspected amoebic meningitis with warm water exposure, an infectious disease specialist and CDC consultation must be urgently considered. In some situations, anticonvulsants are used to prevent or treat ''seizures'' (a possible side effect of inflammation of the brain). Sometimes doctors administer ''corticosteroids'' to reduce brain swelling and inflammation. ''Sedatives'' may be needed for irritability or restlessness. Additional medications might be used to decrease the fever or treat ''headaches''. With severe meningitis that is causing high CSF pressure, a neurosurgeon may be called to insert a tube (CSF shunt) to measure and relieve the pressure. The duration of hospitalization and need for other tests and treatments usually depends on the type of meningitis the patient has and the severity of symptoms.' "
"What is the prognosis (outlook), and what are the complications for patients 
with meningitis?","'The prognosis for meningitis varies. Some cases, like aseptic meningitis, are mild, short, and relatively benign and patients have full recovery. Other cases are severe, and permanent impairment, brain damage, or death is possible. This is usually determined by the type of infection present and how quickly treatment can be started. Meningitis can lead to permanent damage to the nervous system and can cause ''hydrocephalus'' (increased CSF, or ''water on the brain'').''With early diagnosis and prompt treatment, many patients recover from meningitis. Viral meningitis can be self-limited to 10 days or less. However, in some cases, the disease progresses so rapidly that death occurs during the first 48 hours, despite early treatment.' "
Is meningitis contagious?,"'Yes, some forms of viral and bacterial meningitis are ''contagious''. The organisms are spread through the exchange of respiratory and throat secretions (for example, coughing, kissing, sharing of utensils), as well as ''diarrhea'' in the case of viruses. Sometimes meningitis can spread to other people who have had close or prolonged contact with a patient with meningitis.' "
Is it possible to prevent meningitis? Is there a meningitis vaccine?,"""Basic steps to avoid spread of organisms, such hand washing and covering one's mouth when coughing, will also help in decreasing the risk of spreading meningitis. There are ""'vaccines'' against Hib (''Haemophilus influenzae'' type B) and against some strains of ''N. meningitidis'' and many types of ''Streptococcus pneumoniae''. Prior to routine vaccination, ''H. influenzae'' type B was one of the most common causes of acute meningitis and invasive infections in children. These conditions are now uncommon. The vaccines against Hib are very safe and highly effective. By 6 months of age, every infant should receive at least three doses of an Hib vaccine, the earliest at 8 weeks of age. A fourth dose (""booster"") should be given to children between 12 and 18 months of age. ''Hemophilus influenzae'' can cause severe infections in adults, who can spread an invasive strain to a newborn or unvaccinated older child. Certain close contacts of a person with invasive ''H. influenzae'' disease may be considered for preventive antibiotics (called prophylaxis or chemoprophylaxis).''There are two types of vaccines available to prevent ''N. meningitides'' (meningococcal) infections in the U.S. Protection lasts about five years, so they are given during the highest risk age periods:''Because meningococcal disease causes lasting disability or death, it is highly contagious, and ''travelers'' are bringing it home from endemic areas, the CDC recommends two doses of meningococcal conjugate vaccine during the preteen and teen years of greatest risk. Those aged 16 through 23 may also want to be vaccinated with a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine. This is especially important for those intending to attend college as living in the large college environment is a risk factor for developing meningococcal meningitis.''Although large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis do not occur in the United States, some countries experience large, periodic epidemics. Overseas travelers should check to see if meningococcal vaccine is recommended for their destination. Travelers should receive the vaccine at least one week before departure if possible.''Chemoprophylaxis for ''Neisseria meningitidis'"" is very effective in preventing infections of close contacts of people with meningococcal disease and helps prevent or stop epidemics while protection from vaccine kicks in. People in the same household, dormitory, or day care center, or anyone with direct contact with a patient's oral secretions would be considered at increased risk of acquiring the infection. This also holds true for health care professionals involved in direct, prolonged contact, especially during procedures such as intubations (placing a ""'breathing tube''). People who qualify as close contacts of a person with meningitis caused by ''N. meningitidis'' should receive antibiotics (prophylaxis or chemoprophylaxis) to prevent them from getting the disease.''Vaccines to prevent meningitis due to ''S. pneumoniae'' (also called pneumococcal meningitis) can also prevent other forms of infection due to ''S. pneumoniae''. The two types of ''pneumococcal vaccine'' are available in the U.S.:''Interestingly, bacterial meningitis from pneumococcus does not commonly spread or cause outbreaks from people with meningitis but from people who are carrying it in their throat without symptoms. Therefore, prophylaxis of close contacts is not generally recommended for those with pneumococcal meningitis.'

What are side effects of the meningitis vaccine?,"'The side effects of the vaccines available for preventing acute bacterial meningitis are generally mild, and the vaccines are highly effective. The following are possible symptoms that have been reported with the pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Hib vaccines.''Any medical procedure involving a needle (like a vaccine or blood draw for lab tests) can occasionally cause a temporary ''lightheadedness'', ''nausea'', ''ringing in the ears'' or ''fainting'' (blacking out). This is called a ''vasovagal'' reaction. It is a common, normal, and involuntary response to even mild ''pain'' or psychological distress. It is a natural protective reflex against what the body may interpret as a deep bite from a predator. Health care professionals are used to managing this. It helps to remain sitting or lie down if needed for several minutes before standing up. Many people have no vasovagal reaction at all to injections.''Soon after any injection, it is normal to feel a small lump and achiness in the area from the fluid in the tissues. Just like a bruise, it will be sore for a couple of days as the body absorbs the vaccine. If the injection is close to the shoulder tendon, it may cause more ''pain'' and ''stiffness''. If a vein is punctured unexpectedly, there may be a bruise for a several days while the blood is reabsorbed.''Vaccines fool the body into thinking it has an infection. This revs up immune defenses against the actual disease. Most vaccines take at least two weeks to stimulate the highest protective response. It is normal to feels signs of this happening within a few hours or a day, at most. Signs include tiredness, low-grade fever, mild ''chills'', or body aches. ''Babies'' and young children may be irritable or fussy. Some children are prone to ''seizures'' during fever (febrile ''seizure''), but this is fortunately uncommon after vaccines. Most people just have swelling or soreness at the injection site. These symptoms should not be bad enough to interrupt daily activities or work. They should resolve within a few days.''High ''fevers'' or more severe symptoms suggest another condition that may need medical attention and should not be ignored as a possible side effect. It is also important to report possible severe side effects from vaccines. The CDC and FDA monitor vaccine safety and investigate serious events on behalf of the public. Anyone can report a possible problem with a vaccine at the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html.''It is safe to receive more than one type of vaccine at one office visit when possible. The ''human body'' is exposed to hundreds of viruses and bacteria every day. Most vaccines will not interfere with each other, including the above vaccines. They do not seem to cause significantly greater side effects when given at one time. Spacing vaccines apart unnecessarily may cause delays in protection, more discomfort, disruption of daily schedules, and increased costs. Spacing them may also increase the opportunities for a febrile ''seizure'' to occur. On the other hand, it is important to space each vaccine dose at its recommended minimum interval, because this is the time frame proven to give the best immune response. Another issue is how many doses are needed and how many injection sites can be used at one visit. The doses and intervals recommended by CDC take these issues into account.''Any drug, vaccine, or herb can cause an ''allergic reaction''. Symptoms of a severe reaction that requires medical attention include ''itching'', ''hives'' (''urticaria''), swelling of the throat, and difficulty breathing. Severe ''allergic'' reactions occur rarely with any vaccine and happen within a few minutes to hours. Severe allergic reactions have been reported in about one per million doses.' "
How is meningitis treated?,"'Treatment depends on the type of meningitis. The treatment for different types of meningitis is as follows:''Bacterial meningitis'': It is treated with antibiotics. Intravenous administration of ''corticosteroids'' and antibiotics helps to bring down inflammation. After identifying the specific bacteria, physicians may change antibiotics. Besides antibiotics, the physician may also replenish fluids lost from ''sweating'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''.''Viral meningitis'': Most of the cases of viral meningitis resolve on its own. Treatment of mild cases of viral meningitis include:''Antiviral medications'' may be given when there’s an infection with the ''herpes'' virus.''Antifungal medications'' may be useful in treating ''fungal meningitis''.''Parasitic meningitis:'' Early treatment with high-dose intravenous antibiotics may be useful in treating meningitis.''Noninfectious meningitis'': The cause of meningitis is identified and treated.

Neurologic examination can be conducted to assess sensory or motor functions of the brain. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid to identify infections. Lumbar puncture is commonly used to obtain a sample of the cerebrospinal fluid. Brain imaging such as computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal signs of inflammation, internal bleeding, or other brain abnormalities. Electroencephalography or EEG helps to identify abnormal brain waves by monitoring electrical activity in the brain."

The three main parasites responsible for causing meningitis are as follows:''Amoebic meningitis'': This is mainly caused by the amoeba ''Naegleria fowleri'' and may be fatal.' Streptococcus pneumoniae Group B Streptococcus Neisseria meningitidis Hemophilus influenzae Listeria monocytogenes Candida Histoplama Coccidioides Angiostrongylus cantonensis  Baylisascaris procyonis  Gnathostoma spinigerum"
How is meningitis treated?,'Treatment of meningitis differs from person to person depending on the causes. Physicians treat bacterial meningitis using broad-spectrum antibiotics. ''Corticosteroids'' may also be useful to treat the inflammation. Drinking plenty of fluids and taking ''pain'' medicines and antiviral drugs (in case of herpes and ''influenza'' virus) may help to treat viral meningitis. Fungal meningitis requires antifungal medications.' 
What are the complications of meningitis?,'The complications of meningitis include:' Seizures Brain damage Loss of hearing Memory problems Learning problems Difficulty in walking Kidney failure Shock Death
Is it possible to prevent meningitis?,"'It is possible to prevent meningitis by following these simple steps:' Washing hands often Coughing or sneezing into the elbow Avoiding sharing toothbrush, utensils, or lipstick Avoiding sharing foods or drinks Staying healthy Eating well-cooked food Taking vaccinations to prevent meningitis"
What is meningococcemia?,"'Meningococcemia is a bacterial infection of the blood due to ''Neisseria meningitidis'', also called meningococcal ''bacteremia'' or meningococcal ''sepsis''. As the name suggests, this bacterium is best known for causing ''meningococcal meningitis'', which occurs in up to 20% of those with meningococcemia. Up to 75% of those with meningococcal meningitis will also have bacteremia.''Many bacteria can cause bloodstream infections (septicemia), including staphylococci, ''Streptococcus'' B, or ''Streptococcus'' A. In addition, other bacteria can cause meningitis, including ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' or ''leptospirosis''. However, ''N. meningitidis'' is the commonest cause of bacterial meningitis in the U.S. It is more readily contagious from person to person than these other bacteria and causes rapidly progressive and severe disease (fulminant meningococcemia). Rates of infection are typically highest in older children and adolescents, although there are reports of meningococcemia in all age groups. People with deficiency of the complement immune system and those taking complement inhibitors (eculizumab [Soliris]) are at high risk for severe meningococcal disease, even if they are vaccinated.''Other forms of meningococcal disease include ''pneumonia'' in up to 15% of cases and much less often bacterial (septic) ''arthritis'', ''otitis media'' (middle ''ear infection'') and other conditions.''The case-fatality rate of meningococcal disease is high, up to 15%, even with antibiotic treatment; it is up to 40% with bacteremia. Up to 20% who survive have disabilities like deafness, neurologic problems, or amputations.' "
What causes meningococcemia?,"'N. meningitidis'', or meningococcus, is a gram-negative bacillus. Under the microscope, the bacteria usually appear in pairs (diplococcus), like two small kidney beans side by side. Meningococcemia is another term for widespread bloodstream infection.''Humans are the only known source (reservoir) for ''meningococcal infection''. Some people can harbor the bacteria in their throats and not get sick (a ""carrier"" state), but others develop infection. Either can transmit the bacteria.''There are several different types (at least 12 serogroups) of ''N. meningitidis''.' People usually acquire meningococcus by breathing in respiratory droplets or by direct contact with oral secretions by sharing eating utensils, kissing, etc. The presence of a capsule made of complex carbohydrates called polysaccharides increases the infectiousness, or virulence, of N. meningitidis. This capsule protects the bacteria from initial immune defenses of the nose and throat. Once the bacteria colonize the nasopharynx and multiply, they may invade the tissues and enter the bloodstream to cause meningococcal septicemia. This may cause low blood pressure and septic shock. From the blood, they may penetrate between the cells that form the blood-brain barrier to infect the cerebrospinal fluid. This causes bacterial meningitis, or infection of the meninges (or meninx, one of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord). Serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W cause most meningococcal disease, especially outbreaks. In the U.S., Europe, and Australia, serogroups B, C, Y, and less often W cause most infections. Serogroup A causes most of the large epidemics, with A and W causing outbreaks in North Africa around the Hajj pilgrimage. Serotype C caused an outbreak among men who have sex with men in California in August 2016. Serotype B tends to cause more sporadic cases rather than epidemics."
What are risk factors for meningococcemia?,"'Children and adolescents 5 to 19 years of age are at highest risk for meningococcemia. Newborns acquire antibodies from their mothers via the placenta, although these antibodies fade after a few weeks or months. Toddlers are not immune, and there have been several exposures in day care settings. As children age, they gradually gain immunity to meningococcal ''strains'' by coming into contact with milder strains of the bacteria. However, because this immunity is imperfect, it is still possible for adults to get meningococcal disease. In the U.S., medical professionals routinely administer ''meningococcal vaccine'' to children in the preteen and teen years.''HIV'' infection is a risk factor for invasive meningococcal infection. On Aug. 16, 2016, after 24 cases of meningitis arose in men who have sex with men (''MSM''), two of whom had ''HIV'', California public health officials issued an advisory recommending meningococcal vaccination of all HIV-infected people and MSM who planned to travel to the area. This was the largest meningococcal outbreak in MSM in the U.S.''The complement part of the immune system is critical in fighting off meningococcal disease. Patients who have a history of a specific genetic deficiency in the complement system, or who are taking an anti-complement drug for certain diseases, are at high risk for severe disease. The spleen is necessary for an effective immune response against encapsulated bacteria, so people are at higher risk for fulminant meningococcemia if they have had their spleens taken out (asplenia) or have spleens that function poorly (hyposplenism).''People who have been in close contact with an infected person for a long time are at increased risk to acquire the disease. People who live together in close quarters, such as military barracks or college dormitories, are at special risk for disease because one infected person can spread the disease to many others. One study showed that the attack rate in household contacts was 500 times greater than that of the general population.''In some parts of the world, outbreaks of meningococcal disease occur regularly. This is true of a group of countries in sub-Saharan Africa (the ""meningitis belt"") where epidemics occur every five to 10 years, with an attack rate of up to 1,000 cases per 100,000 population (compared to up to three per 100,000 population in the rest of the world).''Outbreaks have occurred during the Islamic Hajj pilgrimage. Over 2 million Muslims from over 180 countries visit Saudi Arabia during the Hajj. The pilgrimage is long and arduous. Heat, throat irritation by dust, dense overcrowding, and inadequate hygiene contribute to infection. Saudi Arabia now requires proof of meningococcal (ACWY) vaccination on an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis before admitting pilgrims. This has greatly reduced the occurrence of meningitis.' "
What are symptoms and signs of meningococcemia?,"'Infected patients initially experience''Once symptoms appear, the disease usually gets rapidly worse over several hours. In a minority of cases, symptoms continue at a low-grade level for several days.''If meningitis is present,''Common meningococcemia symptoms''Severe meningococcemia symptoms''Although meningococcemia refers to an infection of the bloodstream.'   fatigue, fever, nausea, headache, and body aches, similar to those experienced by people with influenza, including swine flu or bird flu. headache, stiffness or resistance to bending the neck forward, and difficulty tolerating light (photophobia) are prominent features. As the symptoms worsen, shaking chills and high fever occur. Rash is common and appears like small red dots (petechiae) or a bleed into the skin (purpura) associated with vasculitis, or inflammation of small blood vessels. With severe meningococcal disease, vasculitis may be extensive and severe enough to cause death or necrosis of the skin (purpura fulminans). The petechial or purpuric rash may appear anywhere on the body, even on the palms or soles or inside the mouth. It may be limited to a small section of the body or cover extensive areas. Thus, a careful physical examination of the skin and mucosal surfaces is important. Petechiae do not disappear or blanche when compressed; one way to diagnose them is to press a clear glass against the skin to see if they disappear. Petechial rash in a person with fever should raise concern for life-threatening meningococcal disease and need for prompt antibiotics. In addition to petechial rash, physical examination reveals a fast heart rate and often low blood pressure and other signs of septic shock. Laboratory examination usually shows increases in white blood cell counts and may show low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). The bacteria may spread to the heart, causing myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. In severe cases, multiple organ systems may fail, including the kidneys, lungs and airways, liver, or heart. Fulminant meningococcemia is rapidly progressive and life-threatening disease. Uncommonly, the bacteria may cause a low-grade bloodstream infection (chronic meningococcemia) with fever, joint pain, and rash that lasts one to three weeks. Severe low blood pressure and vasculitis may cause necrosis of the hands and feet, requiring amputation. It is important to note that up to 15% will develop meningococcal meningitis. Meningococcal sepsis poses a higher risk of shock and death than meningococcal meningitis alone. Although defined differently and having different prognoses, there is significant overlap between meningococcemia and meningococcal meningitis."
How do health care professionals diagnose meningococcemia?,"""A patient's history and physical exam may suggest a diagnosis of meningococcemia, although definitive diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Because the disease can progress rapidly, patients should start treatment promptly without waiting for laboratory test results. Health care professionals diagnose meningococcal infection by culturing ""'N. meningitidis'' from blood cultures. The bacteria grow in one to two days in most cases, and medical professionals use biochemical methods to identify them as ''N. meningitidis''. Samples of the growth can also be stained and examined under the microscope to detect the characteristic double kidney bean (diplococcus) appearance of the bacteria, although additional biochemical tests are performed to confirm the identification of the organism. Once the organism is growing on culture medium, medical professionals perform tests to determine which antibiotics are likely to kill the bacteria (susceptibility testing) because increased resistance to several antibiotics has been documented.''In some instances, skin biopsies from the rash can reveal the organisms under the microscope, but this is difficult and a negative result is not a reliable means of ruling out meningococcemia. Investigators have used a ''PCR'' (''polymerase chain reaction'') laboratory test to detect ''N. meningitidis'' in the blood, although they developed the test for spinal fluid. The drawbacks of PCR are that it cannot determine how susceptible the bacteria are to specific antibiotics and that the test is not available in all hospital laboratories.' "
What is the treatment for meningococcemia?,"  Meningococcal disease is a very severe bacterial infection often requiring intensive care monitoring. The most important treatment for meningococcemia is early intravenous antibiotic therapy. Start antibiotics as soon as meningococcemia is suspected. A third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone [Rocephin], cefotaxime [Claforan]) is the initial treatment of choice. Once investigators have identified cultures with susceptibilities to antibiotics, the antibiotic regimen may be adjusted. In addition to intravenous antibiotics, patients in the intensive care unit will likely require intravenous fluids and sometimes medications (vasopressors) to help maintain and support an adequate blood pressure. Some patients may require ventilator support if they develop respiratory distress. Those with kidney failure may need hemodialysis."
What types of doctors treat meningococcemia or meningococcal disease?," Primary care health professionals such as internists, family practice specialists, pediatricians, and emergency room specialists may be the first clinicians to evaluate and suspect meningococcemia. Critical care specialists, infectious disease specialists, and nephrologists (kidney or renal specialists) may treat people who are seriously ill or have meningitis or have immune suppression in the hospital or intensive care unit."
What is the prognosis of meningococcemia?,"'These complications could include' Despite antibiotic therapy and intensive care monitoring, meningococcemia still has overall case fatality rates of 40% in the United States. Up to 19% have long-term complications from meningococcal infection. amputation of limbs due to ischemia or low blood pressure, adrenal insufficiency from adrenal hemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome), neurological disabilities such as deafness, bacterial arthritis, need for skin grafting, and other problems."
Is it possible to prevent meningococcemia or meningococcal disease?,"'There are several ways to prevent meningococcemia.''Meningococcal disease is vaccine preventable.''In people ages 2 months to 10 years old, physicians recommend conjugate vaccine for''In adults, the recommendations for conjugate ACWY-135 are as below:''In some situations where an individual remains at high risk, doctors perform revaccination after five years. Doctors may also consider serogroup B vaccine at age 16-18, however, serogroup B vaccine is definitely recommended in teens age 16-23 and adults as below:''Health care providers will take special care in giving serogroup B vaccine to infants and children with poor spleen function or who live with HIV. Those ages 2-23 months should receive the Menveo brand of serogroup B vaccine or wait until age 2 to receive Menactra. At that time, they should receive the conjugate ''pneumococcal vaccine'' (PCV-13) first, followed by Menactra. This is because the latter may interfere with development of pneumococcal antibodies.''People taking eculizumab (Soliris) remain at high risk for invasive meningococcal disease, and physicians will monitor them for symptoms even if vaccinated.''Outbreaks of meningococcemia or meningococcal disease occur sporadically around the world but occur more predictably in sub-Saharan Africa. Health care providers should administer the ACWY conjugate vaccine to ''travelers'' visiting these areas. Those with special risk factors above should get the serogroup B vaccine. As mentioned above, Saudi Arabia requires proof of vaccination for travelers during the Hajj.''In addition to vaccination, respiratory etiquette (cover ''coughs'' and sneezes with the elbow or disposable tissue) and hand hygiene (frequent washing with soap and water or ethanol-based hand sanitizer) is very helpful in preventing infections in general.' Infected people are contagious, and health care providers will place them in private isolation rooms in the hospital. Health care workers will wear masks and gloves when entering the room to administer care. Isolation duration varies but usually lasts at least 24 hours after the start of intravenous antibiotics. People who have come in contact with an infected patient should strongly consider taking antibiotics to reduce the risk of disease, a process called prophylactic treatment or chemoprophylaxis. Physicians may have patients take prophylactic antibiotics such as rifampin (Rifadin) or ciprofloxacin (Cipro) in pill form. Sometimes they will administer a shot of ceftriaxone. The choice of antibiotic is based on the age of the patient, resistance patterns in the community, and whether the person is pregnant or not. Close contact usually means household contacts, day care or child care contacts, or those exposed to potentially infected saliva in the week before the patient got sick. Routine patient care does not warrant prophylaxis in health care workers, unless the worker has had very close contact with respiratory secretions, such as when giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or inserting a breathing tube. People should begin prophylaxis as soon as possible after the exposure but certainly within two weeks of the event. The antibiotics help eliminate carriage of the bacteria and physician may also use them in the final step of treatment for infected patients. Doctors should monitor people exposed to N. meningitidis for 10 to 14 days to make sure they do not develop symptoms. Caretakers and health care workers should wash their hands frequently to minimize the transfer of infected secretions to the mouth or nose. There are very effective and safe vaccines available for all five serogroups, but no single vaccine covers all five. A quadrivalent conjugate vaccine covers four major disease-causing serogroups (A, C, Y, W-135). There are two types of vaccines available in the United States in this category (Menactra, Menveo). Two other vaccines cover serogroup B (Bexsero, Trumenba). The choice of vaccine depends on the age of the patient and specific risk factors. Vaccine side effects are usually mild, consisting of a sore arm. Allergic reactions may occur but are very rare. Physicians recommend the ACWY-135 conjugate vaccine as routine for all children starting at 11 years of age in the U.S. Children should get a booster dose at 16 years of age when the incidence of meningococcal disease is highest. Teens who are 16 years of age or older and have never been vaccinated against meningococcal disease need only a single dose. those with absent spleen or dysfunction, those living with HIV, those with immune deficiencies of complement (terminal complement or C5-9 deficiency, properdin deficiency, factor H or factor D deficiency), and those traveling to areas where the disease is common. military recruits, first-year college students living in dormitories (if not received less than 5 years before starting), individuals with absent spleen or dysfunction, people living with HIV, people with immune deficiencies of complement (terminal complement or C5-9 deficiency, properdin deficiency, factor H or factor D deficiency), people taking a complement inhibitor (eculizumab [Soliris]), travelers to areas where the disease is common, researchers, microbiologists, or laboratory staff who may work with N. meningitidis, or people living in a serogroup ACWY outbreak area. individuals with absent spleen or dysfunction, people with immune deficiencies of complement (terminal complement or C5-9 deficiency, properdin deficiency, factor H or factor D deficiency), people taking a complement inhibitor (eculizumab, [Soliris]), and people living in a serogroup B outbreak area."
Where can people find more information on meningococcemia?,'The Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) is a good source of information on ''N. meningitidis'' and the meningococcal vaccine: http://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/. Travelers should consult their physician and the CDC web site (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel) for additional information.' 
What is toxoplasmosis?,"'Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a single-celled protozoan parasite called ''Toxoplasma gondii'', which usually affects warm-blooded animals, including humans. The infection is most commonly acquired from contact with cats and their feces or with raw or undercooked meat.''The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) estimates that more than 60 million people in the United States may carry the ''Toxoplasma gondii'"" parasite, and it infects up to one-third of the world's population, but very few have symptoms because a healthy immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness."" "
What is the cause of toxoplasmosis?,"'There are only a few ways to acquire the ''Toxoplasma gondii ''parasite:''Cats are the most common host for ''Toxoplasma gondii''. Oocysts, one of the life cycle stages of ''T. gondii'', are shed in cat feces, which can transmit the infection when ingested orally. Warm-blooded animals, including humans, pigs, cows, goats, and deer, can serve as an intermediate host in which tissue ''cysts'' (containing bradyzoites) develop. Infection can also occur due to accidental ingestion of these tissue cysts when undercooked or raw meat is eaten. ' Contact with cats or cat feces Eating raw or undercooked meat Drinking raw milk from an infected goat (Goats can be an intermediate host for the parasite.) Organ transplantation or blood transfusion from an infected person"
What are risk factors for acquiring toxo?,"'The following risk factors and situations potentially expose a person to the ''Toxoplasma gondii'' parasite and increase the risk of acquiring toxoplasmosis infection:''If a woman is ''pregnant'' when she is infected with toxo, the infection can be transmitted to the baby with sometimes catastrophic consequences.'  Touching your hands to your mouth after gardening, cleaning a cat's litter box, or anything that came into contact with cat feces Eating raw or partly cooked meat, especially pork, lamb, or venison Using utensils or cutting boards that have not been properly cleaned after they have had contact with raw meat Drinking raw goat's milk Touching your hands to your mouth after contact with raw or undercooked meat Organ transplantation or transfusion (this is rare)"
What are the usual symptoms of toxoplasmosis?,"'Although people infected with toxoplasmosis are often unaware of having this disease, typical symptoms of toxo are flulike symptoms, including ''swollen lymph nodes'' and muscle aches and pains that last from a few days to several weeks. If your immune system is normal, you cannot get the infection again.'  "
Why do some people develop severe problems from toxo?,"'Few people with toxoplasmosis infection develop symptoms because the immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. However, anyone with a compromised immune system is at risk for serious and even life-threatening problems from toxo. Immunocompromised individuals include those undergoing ''chemotherapy'', people with ''HIV/AIDS'' or other immune disorders, and recent organ-transplant recipients.''In these people, an infection that occurred anytime during life can reactivate and cause the severe symptoms of toxoplasmosis such as damage to the eye, brain, or other organs.''Ocular'' toxoplasmosis, which damages the eyes, can lead to reduced vision, ''blurred vision'', ''pain'' (often with bright light), redness of the eye, and sometimes tearing, according to the CDC.' "
Can toxoplasmosis develop into a more serious illness in babies?,"'Yes, the immune system in infants is not fully mature until after birth. Congenital toxoplasmosis occurs when a fetus is infected.''The ''babies'' of women who were exposed to toxo within a few months of ''becoming pregnant'' or during pregnancy are at an increased risk for developing a severe case of toxo. Pregnant women who newly contract the toxoplasmosis parasite have a 20% chance of transmitting it to their unborn child, according to the Organization of Teratology Specialists. When the mother is infected in the ''first trimester'', there is a 10%-15% chance of passing the parasite on to her child. In the U.S., it is estimated that up to 4,000 babies are born with congenital toxoplasmosis annually. Women who were first exposed to toxo more than six months before becoming pregnant are not likely to pass the infection to their children.''Most newborns have no symptoms, but a small percentage may be born with ''birth defects'' such as congenital eye or ''brain damage''. Unfortunately, the signs and symptoms of the disease often appear a few months after birth.''Some signs of congenital toxoplasmosis may be present at birth, such as ''jaundice'', skin ''rash'', and ''enlarged lymph nodes''.' "
"What is meant by a baby developing ""a more severe case of toxo""?","'Children born with toxoplasmosis can be afflicted with birth defects, including intellectual disabilities, convulsions, ''spasticity'', ''cerebral palsy'"", deafness, and severely impaired vision. The infant's head may be abnormally small (""'microcephaly'') or abnormally large due to increased pressure on the brain (''hydrocephalus'').' "
What tests do health care providers use to diagnose toxo in the lab?,"'A toxoplasmosis blood test checks for the presence of ''Toxoplasma gondii'' in the blood. The results can determine if the patient has had toxo and whether the infection is recent (""acute"") or not.' "
Is it possible to prevent toxoplasmosis?,"'Since ''Toxoplasma gondii'"" infection usually causes mild to no symptoms, and a healthy immune system prevents any remaining parasites in the body from causing further symptoms, most people don't need to worry about getting this disease. Currently, there is no ""'vaccine'' for toxoplasmosis in humans.''However, if you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant, there are several steps you should take to prevent exposure to toxoplasmosis.' If you have a weakened immune system, get a blood test for toxoplasmosis. If your test is positive, your doctor can tell you if and when you need to take medicine to prevent the infection from reactivating. If you are planning on becoming pregnant, talk to a doctor about being tested for toxo. If the test is positive, there is no need to worry about passing the infection to your baby (since you should have immunity against the parasite). If you are already pregnant, you should discuss your risk of toxoplasmosis with your doctor who may order a blood sample for testing. Wear gloves when you garden or do anything outdoors that involves handling soil since cats often use gardens and sandboxes as litter boxes. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water after outdoor activities, especially before you eat or prepare food. Have someone else handle raw meat for you. If this is not possible, wear clean latex or nitrile gloves and thoroughly wash with soap and hot water any cutting boards, sinks, knives, and other utensils that might have touched the raw meat. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water afterward. Cook all meat thoroughly, especially pork or veal. Take note of the recommendations listed below regarding cats."
Am I able to keep my cat?,"'Yes, but if you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant, there are some steps to take to avoid being exposed to toxo, according to the Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine.'""Most importantly, you can help prevent your cats from getting infected with toxo. Feed them dry or canned cat food and keep them indoors. Cats can become infected by eating or being fed raw or undercooked meat that is infected with the parasite, or by eating infected prey such as birds or rodents. Any cat that is allowed access to outdoors should be kept off beds, pillows, or other furniture that you also use. Don't bring a new cat into your house that might have been an outdoor cat or might have been fed raw meat. Avoid handling stray cats and kittens. Have your cat tested for the parasite. Your vet can answer any other questions you may have regarding your cat and the risk for toxoplasmosis.""""Have someone who is healthy and not pregnant change your cat's litter box. If this is not possible, wear gloves and clean the litter box daily (the parasite found in cat feces needs a few days after being passed to become infectious). Wash your hands well with soap and warm water afterward."" "
"Once infected with toxo, is my cat always able to spread the infection to me?","""No, cats can only spread toxo in their feces for a few weeks after they are first infected with the parasite. Like humans, cats rarely have symptoms when first infected, so most people don't know if their cat has been exposed to toxo. Most infected cats appear healthy. There are no good tests available to determine if your cat is passing toxo in its feces."" "
What is the treatment for toxoplasmosis?,"'Once the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is confirmed, you and your doctor should discuss whether treatment is necessary. In an otherwise healthy person who is not pregnant, treatment is not needed. Symptoms will usually go away within a few weeks.''For pregnant women or people who have weakened immune systems, ''drugs'' are available to treat the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis. Doctors prescribe drugs in combination, most commonly ''pyrimethamine'' plus ''sulfadiazine'' or trisulfapyrimidines. Pregnant women may also use spiramycin. ' "
What is the prognosis for toxoplasmosis?,"'The majority of people who get toxoplasmosis who have a healthy immune response will have no significant long-term effects.''An infected fetus or infant has a variable prognosis, depending on the severity of the effects of the disease. The earlier the fetus is infected, the worse the prognosis. A woman carrying a severely affected fetus may experience a spontaneous abortion (''miscarriage''), and newborns may develop significant physical or mental problems.''Patients with compromised immune systems have a variable prognosis, depending on their response to treatment. Patients with ''HIV'' or long-term immunocompromised states will need to continue treatment for life. ' "
What is menopause?,"'Menopause is defined as the state of an absence of menstrual periods for 12 months. The menopausal transition starts with varying ''menstrual cycle'' length and ends with the final ''menstrual period''. ''Perimenopause'' is a term sometimes used and means ""the time around menopause."" It is often used to refer to the menopausal transitional period. It is not officially a medical term, but is sometimes used to explain certain aspects of the menopause transition in lay terms. ""Postmenopausal"" is a term used to as an adjective to refer to the time after menopause has occurred. For example, doctors may speak of a condition that occurs in ""postmenopausal women."" This refers to women who have already reached menopause.'""Menopause is the time in a woman's life when the function of the ovaries ceases. As a result, she can no longer become ""'pregnant''. The ovary (female gonad), is one of a pair of reproductive glands in women. They are situated in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus. Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries produce eggs (ova) and female hormones such as estrogen. During each monthly menstrual cycle, an egg is released from one ovary. The egg travels from the ovary through a Fallopian tube to the uterus.''The ovaries are the main source of female hormones, which control the development of female body characteristics such as the breasts, body shape, and body hair. The hormones also regulate the menstrual cycle and ''pregnancy''. Estrogens also protect the bone. Therefore, a woman can develop ''osteoporosis'' (thinning of bone) later in life when her ovaries do not produce adequate estrogen.'  "
At what age does a woman typically reach menopause?,"'The average age of menopause is 51 years old. However, there is no way to predict when an individual woman will have menopause or begin having symptoms suggestive of menopause. The age at which a woman starts having menstrual periods is also not related to the age of menopause onset. Most women reach menopause between the ages of 45 and 55, but menopause may occur as earlier as ages 30s or 40s, or may not occur until a woman reaches her 60s. As a rough ""rule of thumb,"" women tend to undergo menopause at an age similar to that of their mothers.''Symptoms and signs related to the menopausal transition such as irregularities in the menstrual cycle, can begin up to 10 years prior to the last menstrual period.' "
How long does menopause last?,"""Menopause is a single point in time and not a process; it is the time point in at which a woman's last period ends. Of course, a woman will not know when that time point has occurred until she has been 12 consecutive months without a period. The symptoms of menopause, on the other hand, may begin years before the actual menopause occurs and may persist for some years afterward as well."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of menopause?,"""It is important to remember that each woman's experience is highly individual. Some women may experience few or no symptoms of menopause, while others experience multiple physical and psychological symptoms. The extent and severity of symptoms varies significantly among women. It is also important to remember that symptoms may come and go over an extended period for some women. This, too, is highly individual. These symptoms of menopause and perimenopause are discussed in detail below.""'Irregular ''vaginal bleeding'' may occur as a woman reaches menopause. Some women have minimal problems with abnormal bleeding during the prior time to menopause whereas others have unpredictable, excessive bleeding. Menstrual periods (menses) may occur more frequently (meaning the cycle shortens in duration), or they may get farther and farther apart (meaning the cycle lengthens in duration) before stopping. There is no ""normal"" pattern of bleeding during the perimenopause, and patterns vary from woman to woman. It is common for women in perimenopause to have a period after going for several months without one. There is also no set length of time it takes for a woman to complete the menopausal transition. A woman can have irregular periods for years prior to reaching menopause. It is important to remember that all women who develop irregular menses should be evaluated by their doctor to confirm that the irregular menses are due to perimenopause and not as a sign of another medical condition.''The menstrual abnormalities that begin in the perimenopause are also associated with a decrease in ''fertility'', since ''ovulation'' has become irregular. However, women who are perimenopausal may still become pregnant until they have reached true menopause (the absence of periods for one year) and should still use ''contraception'' if they do not wish to become pregnant.''Hot flashes'' are common among women undergoing menopause. A hot flash is a feeling of warmth that spreads over the body and is often most pronounced in the head and chest. A hot flash is sometimes associated with flushing and is sometimes followed by ''perspiration''. Hot flashes usually last from 30 seconds to several minutes. Although the exact cause of hot flashes is not fully understood, hot flashes are likely due to a combination of hormonal and biochemical fluctuations brought on by declining estrogen levels.''There is currently no method to predict when hot flashes will begin and how long they will last. Hot flashes occur in up to 40% of regularly menstruating women in their forties, so they may begin before the menstrual irregularities characteristic of menopause even begin. About 80% of women will be finished having hot flashes after five years. Sometimes (in about 10% of women), hot flashes can last as long as 10 years. There is no way to predict when hot flashes will cease, though they tend to decrease in frequency over time. They may also wax and wane in their severity. The average woman who has hot flashes will have them for about five years.''Sometimes hot flashes are accompanied by ''night sweats'' (episodes of drenching sweats at nighttime). This may lead to awakening and difficulty falling asleep again, resulting in unrefreshing ''sleep'' and daytime ''tiredness''.''Night sweats (episodes of drenching sweats at nighttime) sometimes accompany hot flashes. This may lead to awakening and difficulty falling asleep again, resulting in unrefreshing ''sleep'' and daytime tiredness.''Vaginal symptoms occur because the tissues lining the vagina becoming thinner, drier, and less elastic as estrogen levels fall. Symptoms may include ''vaginal dryness'', ''itching'', or irritation and/or ''pain'' with sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). The vaginal changes also lead to an increased risk of vaginal infections.''The lining of the urethra (the transport tube leading from the bladder to discharge urine outside the body) also undergoes changes similar to the tissues of the vagina, and becomes drier, thinner, and less elastic with declining estrogen levels. This can lead to an increased risk of ''urinary tract infection'', feeling the need to urinate more frequently, or leakage of urine (''urinary incontinence''). The ''incontinence'' can result from a strong, sudden urge to urinate or may occur during straining when ''coughing'', laughing, or lifting heavy objects.''Women in perimenopause often report a variety of thinking (cognitive) and/or emotional symptoms, including ''fatigue'', memory problems, irritability, and rapid changes in mood. It is difficult to determine exactly which behavioral symptoms are due directly to the hormonal changes of menopause. Research in this area has been difficult for many reasons.''Emotional and cognitive symptoms are so common that it is sometimes difficult in a given woman to know if they are due to menopause. The night sweats that may occur during perimenopause can also contribute to feelings of tiredness and ''fatigue'', which can have an effect on mood and cognitive performance. Finally, many women may be experiencing other life changes during the time of perimenopause or after menopause, such as stressful life events, that may also cause emotional symptoms.''Many women report some degree of ''weight gain'' along with menopause. The distribution of body fat may change, with body fat being deposited more in the waist and abdominal area than in the hips and thighs. Changes in skin texture, including ''wrinkles'', may develop along with worsening of ''adult acne'' in those affected by this condition. Since the body continues to produce small levels of the male hormone testosterone, some women may experience some hair growth on the chin, upper lip, chest, or abdomen.'  "
What conditions can cause early menopause?,"'Certain medical and surgical conditions can influence the timing of menopause.''The surgical removal of the ovaries (''oophorectomy'') in an ovulating woman will result in an immediate menopause, sometimes termed a ''surgical menopause'', or induced menopause. In this case, there is no perimenopause, and after surgery, a woman will generally experience the signs and symptoms of menopause. In cases of surgical menopause, women often report that the abrupt onset of menopausal symptoms results in particularly severe symptoms, but this is not always the case.''The ovaries are often removed together with the removal of the uterus (''hysterectomy''). If a hysterectomy is performed without removal of both ovaries in a woman who has not yet reached menopause, the remaining ovary or ovaries are still capable of normal hormone production. While a woman cannot menstruate after the uterus is removed by a hysterectomy, the ovaries themselves can continue to produce hormones up until the normal time when menopause would naturally occur. At this time, a woman could experience the other symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes and ''mood swings''. These symptoms would then not be associated with the cessation of ''menstruation''. Another possibility is that ''premature ovarian failure'' will occur earlier than the expected time of menopause, as early as one to two years following the hysterectomy. If this happens, a woman may or may not experience symptoms of menopause.''Depending upon the type and location of the ''cancer'' and its treatment, these types of ''cancer'' therapy (''chemotherapy'' and/or ''radiation therapy'') can result in menopause if given to an ovulating woman. In this case, the symptoms of menopause may begin during the ''cancer'' treatment or may develop months following the treatment.''Premature ovarian failure is defined as the occurrence of menopause before the age of 40. This condition occurs in about 1% of all women. The cause of premature ovarian failure is not fully understood, but it may be related to autoimmune diseases or ''inherited'' (genetic) factors.' "
What tests diagnose menopause?,"'Because hormone levels may fluctuate greatly in an individual woman, even from one day to the next, hormone levels are not a reliable method for diagnosing menopause. There is no single blood test that reliably predicts when a woman is going through the menopausal transition, so there is currently no proven role for blood testing to diagnose menopause. The only way to diagnose menopause is to observe the lack of menstrual periods for 12 months in a woman in the expected age range.' "
What are the treatment options for menopause?,"'Menopause itself is a normal part of life and not a disease that requires treatment. However, treatment of associated symptoms is possible if these become substantial or severe.'  "
Hormone treatment and therapy,"'Hormone therapy'' (HT), or menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), consists of estrogens or a combination of estrogens and ''progesterone'' (progestin). This was formerly referred to as ''hormone replacement therapy'' (''HRT''). Hormone therapy controls the symptoms of menopause related to declining estrogen levels (such as hot flashes and ''vaginal dryness''), and HT is still the most effective way to treat these symptoms. But long-term studies (the NIH-sponsored '""Women's Health""' Initiative, or WHI) of women receiving combined hormone therapy with both estrogen and progesterone were halted when it was discovered that these women had an increased risk for ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''breast cancer'' when compared with women who did not receive HT. These risks were most pronounced in women over 60 taking hormone therapy. Later studies of women taking estrogen therapy alone showed that estrogen was associated with an increased risk for ''stroke'', but not for ''heart'' attack or ''breast cancer''. Estrogen therapy alone, however, is associated with an increased risk of developing ''endometrial cancer'' (cancer of the lining of the uterus) in postmenopausal women who have not had their uterus surgically removed.''Hormone therapy is available in oral (pill), transdermal form (for example, patch and spray such as Vivelle, ''Climara'', Estraderm, Esclim, ''Alora''). Transdermal hormone products are already in their active form without the need for ""first pass"" metabolism in the ''liver'' to be converted to an active form. Since transdermal hormone products do not have effects on the liver, this route of administration has become the preferred form for most women.''There has been interest in recent years in the use of so-called ""bioidentical"" hormone therapy for perimenopausal women. The hormones are created in a laboratory by altering compounds derived from naturally occurring plant products. Some of these so-called bioidentical hormone preparations are made at compounding pharmacies that make the preparations on a case-by-case basis for each patient. The does not regulate individual FDA compound preparations because compounded products are not standardized. Bioidentical hormone therapy products are typically applied as cream or gels. Studies to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of these products have not been carried out, and expert panels currently do not recommend the use of custom-compounded hormone therapies.'""In summary, the decision about hormone therapy is a very individual decision in which the patient and doctor must take into account the inherent risks and benefits of the treatment along with each woman's own medical history. It is currently recommended that if hormone therapy is used, it should be used at the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible time. It is currently recommended that hormone therapy be used if the balance of risks and benefits is favorable for the individual woman."" "
Oral contraceptives and vaginal treatments,"'Oral ''contraceptive'' pills are another form of hormone therapy often prescribed for women in perimenopause to treat irregular vaginal bleeding. Women in the menopausal transition tend to have considerable breakthrough bleeding when given estrogen therapy. Therefore, ''oral contraceptives'' are often given to women in the menopause transition to regulate menstrual periods, relieve hot flashes, as well as to provide contraception. They are not recommended for women who have already reached menopause, because the dose of estrogen is higher than that needed to control hot flashes and other symptoms. The contraindications for oral contraceptives in women going through the menopause transition is the same as that for premenopausal women.''There are also local (meaning applied directly to the vagina) hormonal treatments for the symptoms of vaginal estrogen deficiency. Local treatments include the vaginal estrogen ring (Estring), vaginal estrogen cream, or vaginal estrogen tablets. Local and oral estrogen treatments are sometimes combined for this purpose.''Vaginal moisturizing agents such as creams or lotions (for example, K-Y Silk-E Vaginal Moisturizer or KY Liquibeads Vaginal Moisturizer) as well as the use of lubricants during intercourse are non-hormonal options for managing the discomfort of vaginal dryness.' "
Antidepressants and other medications,"'Antidepressant'' medications'': The class of ''drugs'' known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and related medications have been shown to be effective in controlling the symptoms of hot flashes in up to 60% of women. Specifically, ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), a drug related to the SSRIs, and the ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil'', ''Brisdelle''), ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), and ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro'') have all been shown to decrease the severity of hot flashes in some women. However, antidepressant medications may be associated with side effects, including ''decreased libido'' or sexual dysfunction.''Other medications'': Other prescription medications have been shown to provide some relief for hot flashes, although their specific purpose is not the treatment of hot flashes. All of these may have side effects, and their use should be discussed with and monitored by a doctor. Some of these medications that have been shown to help relieve hot flashes include the antiseizure drug ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin'') and ''clonidine'' (''Catapres''), a drug used to treat ''high blood pressure''.' "
Home remedies: Plant estrogens,"'Isoflavones are chemical compounds found in ''soy'' and other plants that are phytoestrogens, or plant-derived estrogens. There is a perception among many women that plant estrogens are ""natural"" and therefore safer than HT, but medical researchers haven\'t proven this scientifically. Most scientific studies have not shown a benefit of phytoestrogens in controlling hot flashes. In addition, there is concern that some phytoestrogens might act like estrogen in some tissues of the body. Therefore, many experts recommend that women who have a history of ''breast cancer'' avoid phytoestrogens.' "
"Home remedies: vitamin E, black cohosh, and herbs","'Some women report that ''vitamin E'' ''supplements'' can provide relief from mild hot flashes, but scientific studies are lacking to prove the effectiveness of vitamin E in relieving symptoms of menopause. Taking a dosage greater than 400 international units (IU) of vitamin E may not be safe, since some studies have suggested that greater dosages may be associated with ''cardiovascular disease'' risk.''Black cohosh'' is an herbal preparation promoted for the relief of hot flashes. ''Clinical trials'' show that black cohosh is actually no more effective than placebo in controlling hot flashes.''There are many ''supplements'' and substances that have been advertised as ""natural"" treatments for symptoms of menopause, including ''licorice'', ''dong quai'', chasteberry, and ''wild yam''. Scientific studies have not proven the safety or effectiveness of these products.' "
Vaginal lubricants for menopause symptoms,"'In women for whom oral or vaginal estrogens are deemed inappropriate, such as breast cancer survivors, or women who do not wish to take oral or vaginal estrogen, there are varieties of ''over-the-counter'' vaginal lubricants. However, they are probably not as effective in relieving vaginal symptoms as replacing the estrogen deficiency with oral or local estrogen.' "
Lifestyle factors in controlling the symptoms and complications of menopause,"'Many of the symptoms of menopause and the medical complications that may develop in postmenopausal women can be lessened or even avoided by taking steps to lead a healthy lifestyle.''The symptoms of menopause are often treated by a woman’s gynecologist. Primary care providers, including family medicine specialists and internists, may also treat the symptoms of menopause.' Regular exercise can help protect against cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. Exercise also has proven mental health benefits. Proper nutrition Stop smoking"
What are the complications and effects of menopause on chronic medical conditions?,"'Osteoporosis'' is the deterioration of the quantity and quality of bone that causes an increased risk of ''fracture''. The density of the bone (''bone mineral density'') normally begins to decrease in women during the fourth decade of life. However, that normal decline in ''bone density'' is accelerated during the menopausal transition. Consequently, both age and the hormonal changes due to the menopause transition act together to cause osteoporosis. Medications to treat osteoporosis are currently available and pose less risk than hormone therapy. Therefore, hormone therapy is not recommended for ''prevention'' or treatment of osteoporosis.''Prior to menopause, women have a decreased risk of ''heart disease'' and ''stroke'"" when compared with men. Around the time of menopause, however, a women's risk of cardiovascular disease increases. ""'Heart disease'' is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the U.S.''Coronary heart disease rates in postmenopausal women are two to three times higher than in women of the same age who have not reached menopause. This increased risk for cardiovascular disease may be related to declining estrogen levels, but in light of other factors, medical professionals do not advise postmenopausal women to take hormone therapy simply as a preventive measure to decrease their risk of heart attack or ''stroke''.' "
What is menopause?,"'Menopause is defined as the state of an absence of menstrual periods for 12 months. The menopausal transition starts with varying ''menstrual cycle'' length and ends with the final ''menstrual period''. ''Perimenopause'' is a term sometimes used and means ""the time around menopause."" It is often used to refer to the menopausal transitional period. It is not officially a medical term, but is sometimes used to explain certain aspects of the menopause transition in lay terms. ""Postmenopausal"" is a term used to as an adjective to refer to the time after menopause has occurred. For example, doctors may speak of a condition that occurs in ""postmenopausal women."" This refers to women who have already reached menopause.'""Menopause is the time in a woman's life when the function of the ovaries ceases. As a result, she can no longer become ""'pregnant''. The ovary (female gonad), is one of a pair of reproductive glands in women. They are situated in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus. Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries produce eggs (ova) and female hormones such as estrogen. During each monthly menstrual cycle, an egg is released from one ovary. The egg travels from the ovary through a Fallopian tube to the uterus.''The ovaries are the main source of female hormones, which control the development of female body characteristics such as the breasts, body shape, and body hair. The hormones also regulate the menstrual cycle and ''pregnancy''. Estrogens also protect the bone. Therefore, a woman can develop ''osteoporosis'' (thinning of bone) later in life when her ovaries do not produce adequate estrogen.'  "
At what age does a woman typically reach menopause?,"'The average age of menopause is 51 years old. However, there is no way to predict when an individual woman will have menopause or begin having symptoms suggestive of menopause. The age at which a woman starts having menstrual periods is also not related to the age of menopause onset. Most women reach menopause between the ages of 45 and 55, but menopause may occur as earlier as ages 30s or 40s, or may not occur until a woman reaches her 60s. As a rough ""rule of thumb,"" women tend to undergo menopause at an age similar to that of their mothers.''Symptoms and signs related to the menopausal transition such as irregularities in the menstrual cycle, can begin up to 10 years prior to the last menstrual period.' "
How long does menopause last?,"""Menopause is a single point in time and not a process; it is the time point in at which a woman's last period ends. Of course, a woman will not know when that time point has occurred until she has been 12 consecutive months without a period. The symptoms of menopause, on the other hand, may begin years before the actual menopause occurs and may persist for some years afterward as well."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of menopause?,"""It is important to remember that each woman's experience is highly individual. Some women may experience few or no symptoms of menopause, while others experience multiple physical and psychological symptoms. The extent and severity of symptoms varies significantly among women. It is also important to remember that symptoms may come and go over an extended period for some women. This, too, is highly individual. These symptoms of menopause and perimenopause are discussed in detail below.""'Irregular ''vaginal bleeding'' may occur as a woman reaches menopause. Some women have minimal problems with abnormal bleeding during the prior time to menopause whereas others have unpredictable, excessive bleeding. Menstrual periods (menses) may occur more frequently (meaning the cycle shortens in duration), or they may get farther and farther apart (meaning the cycle lengthens in duration) before stopping. There is no ""normal"" pattern of bleeding during the perimenopause, and patterns vary from woman to woman. It is common for women in perimenopause to have a period after going for several months without one. There is also no set length of time it takes for a woman to complete the menopausal transition. A woman can have irregular periods for years prior to reaching menopause. It is important to remember that all women who develop irregular menses should be evaluated by their doctor to confirm that the irregular menses are due to perimenopause and not as a sign of another medical condition.''The menstrual abnormalities that begin in the perimenopause are also associated with a decrease in ''fertility'', since ''ovulation'' has become irregular. However, women who are perimenopausal may still become pregnant until they have reached true menopause (the absence of periods for one year) and should still use ''contraception'' if they do not wish to become pregnant.''Hot flashes'' are common among women undergoing menopause. A hot flash is a feeling of warmth that spreads over the body and is often most pronounced in the head and chest. A hot flash is sometimes associated with flushing and is sometimes followed by ''perspiration''. Hot flashes usually last from 30 seconds to several minutes. Although the exact cause of hot flashes is not fully understood, hot flashes are likely due to a combination of hormonal and biochemical fluctuations brought on by declining estrogen levels.''There is currently no method to predict when hot flashes will begin and how long they will last. Hot flashes occur in up to 40% of regularly menstruating women in their forties, so they may begin before the menstrual irregularities characteristic of menopause even begin. About 80% of women will be finished having hot flashes after five years. Sometimes (in about 10% of women), hot flashes can last as long as 10 years. There is no way to predict when hot flashes will cease, though they tend to decrease in frequency over time. They may also wax and wane in their severity. The average woman who has hot flashes will have them for about five years.''Sometimes hot flashes are accompanied by ''night sweats'' (episodes of drenching sweats at nighttime). This may lead to awakening and difficulty falling asleep again, resulting in unrefreshing ''sleep'' and daytime ''tiredness''.''Night sweats (episodes of drenching sweats at nighttime) sometimes accompany hot flashes. This may lead to awakening and difficulty falling asleep again, resulting in unrefreshing ''sleep'' and daytime tiredness.''Vaginal symptoms occur because the tissues lining the vagina becoming thinner, drier, and less elastic as estrogen levels fall. Symptoms may include ''vaginal dryness'', ''itching'', or irritation and/or ''pain'' with sexual intercourse (dyspareunia). The vaginal changes also lead to an increased risk of vaginal infections.''The lining of the urethra (the transport tube leading from the bladder to discharge urine outside the body) also undergoes changes similar to the tissues of the vagina, and becomes drier, thinner, and less elastic with declining estrogen levels. This can lead to an increased risk of ''urinary tract infection'', feeling the need to urinate more frequently, or leakage of urine (''urinary incontinence''). The ''incontinence'' can result from a strong, sudden urge to urinate or may occur during straining when ''coughing'', laughing, or lifting heavy objects.''Women in perimenopause often report a variety of thinking (cognitive) and/or emotional symptoms, including ''fatigue'', memory problems, irritability, and rapid changes in mood. It is difficult to determine exactly which behavioral symptoms are due directly to the hormonal changes of menopause.

Finally, many women may be experiencing other life changes during the time of perimenopause or after menopause, such as stressful life events, that may also cause emotional symptoms.''Many women report some degree of ''weight gain'' along with menopause. The distribution of body fat may change, with body fat being deposited more in the waist and abdominal area than in the hips and thighs. Changes in skin texture, including ''wrinkles'', may develop along with worsening of ''adult acne'' in those affected by this condition.

Will I have a low sex drive or other intimacy problems during menopause?,"   Although menopause may have some negative effects on sexual function, this is not always the case. Each woman's experience of menopause is unique; not all women have the same symptoms or experience symptoms with the same degree of severity. Decreases in estrogen levels after menopause can cause a decrease in libido. Vaginal dryness is another symptom of menopause that can have an impact on sexual function. Hormone therapy and water-soluble lubricants are two ways to help relieve vaginal dryness associated with menopause. Other symptoms of menopause, such as trouble sleeping and mood swings, can also interfere with enjoyment of sexual activity."
How does menopause affect sexual function in women?,"'Just as every women experiences menopause differently, women may or may not experience changes in sexual function after menopause. Since estrogen levels are lower after menopause, some women may notice that their libido, or sex drive, is decreased. Low estrogen levels can also lead to a decreased blood flow to the vagina, resulting in difficulty with lubrication or in dryness which that can make sexual intercourse less pleasant and painful for many women.''Not all women report negative changes in sexual function after menopause. For example, some women may find sex to be more pleasurable without the fear of unwanted ''pregnancy'' or without the potential stresses of having small children.' "
Symptoms of peri - and -menopause that can affect sexual desire,"'A decrease in estrogen levels is the hallmark of menopause, and this change in hormone level can cause a number of different symptoms. Not all women experience all the characteristic symptoms of menopause, but some women may have more severe symptoms than others. In addition to vaginal dryness and ''decreased libido'', menopause can be associated with other troublesome symptoms that can affect sexual drive and function. Examples of these symptoms include:''These symptoms alone are sufficient to affect sexual function in many women.'   Difficulty sleeping Hot flashes Headache Mood changes Stress Anxiety Depression Bladder control issues Night sweats Weight gain"
What are treatments are available for sexual problems during menopause?,"'Estrogen therapy (ET) is available for women to treat symptoms of menopause, although due to some health risks (see below), not all women choose to take estrogen therapy. Estrogen, in pill, patch, trandsdermal spray, or gel form; is the single most effective therapy for troubling symptoms of menopause. Because ET alone can cause ''uterine cancer'' (endomketrial ''cancer''), a progestin drug is typically given together with estrogen in women who have a uterus (those who have not undergone a ''hysterectomy'') to eliminate this increased risk. Hormone therapy has been shown to have other risks, including small but significant risks of ''stroke'' and ''heart disease''. Because of these risks, women who have no major menopausal symptoms may choose to avoid hormone therapy (HT) altogether. Most doctors agree that hormone therapy, when used for symptoms of menopause, should be used in the lowest effective dose and for the shortest time period of time possible.''Estrogen is also available for use in the treatment of vaginal dryness as an isolated symptom. Topical estrogen is available in forms of creams, vaginal rings (devices that secrete estrogen locally within the vagina for up to three months), and vaginal tablets. These products are inserted directly into the vagina, and they can help relieve some of the symptoms of vaginal dryness and discomfort. Water-soluble lubricants (such as K-Y jelly, K-Y Silk, liquibeads, etc.) can also be effective in the relief of vaginal dryness. Estrogen administered vaginally is given in very low doses, and it is noit associated with the risks of systemic (i.e. bloodborne) hormone therapy such as that given to treat ''hot flashes'' and other widespread ''menopause symptoms''.'  "
How can a woman heighten and improve her sexual function and desire during and after menopause?,"'As discussed above, the use of systemic hormone therapy or vaginal estrogen therapy can diminish vaginal dryness and decrease any discomfort associated with sexual intercourse. Water-soluble lubricants can also help overcome vaginal discomfort. Some women find that relaxation techniques, sensual ''massage'', ''masturbation'', or changing positions during ''coitus'' can heighten their sexual experiences. For women or couples who are struggling to understand and accept the changes in sexual function that may accompany menopause, counseling can be an option. Talk with your partner about the changes that are happening to your body. Some couples try counseling on an individual basis or as a couple.'  "
Facts you should know about hot flashes,"   Hot flashes are feelings of warmth that spread over the body and last from 30 seconds to a few minutes. Hot flashes may be accompanied by redness of the skin, known as flushing, and excessive sweating. Hot flashes are a characteristic symptom of the menopausal transition (perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopause) in women, but may occasionally result from other medical conditions. About 70% of women will experience hot flashes at some point in the menopausal transition. Hot flashes in men, young women, or during pregnancy may be due to medical conditions that interfere with the body’s ability regulate temperature. Hot flashes may be treated by hormone therapy or other medications if necessary. Natural home remedies for hot flashes have been proposed and may provide relief for some women; the effectiveness of other alternative treatments has not been adequately scientifically evaluated."
What are hot flashes?,"'A hot flash is a sensation of heat that begins in the head and neck regions. Hot flashes are a common symptom experienced by women prior to, and during the early stages of the menopausal transition. However, not all women approaching the ''menopause'' will develop hot flashes.' "
How long do hot flashes last?,"'Hot flashes are typically brief, lasting from about 30 seconds to a few minutes.'""The question of how long during a woman's lifetime that hot flashes last is a different one. Traditionally, it was believed that women only experienced hot flashes for a few years. More recent data suggest that many women may experience hot flashes for longer time periods. In a study from the University of Pennsylvania, the mean duration of hot flashes was 4.9 years, but up to a third of women continued to have hot flashes for up to 10 years. In the Study of Women Across the Nation (SWAN), women had hot flashes for an average of 7.4 years total and for an average of 4.5 years after the ""'last menstrual period''.' "
What causes hot flashes?,"'The complex hormonal changes that accompany the ''aging'' process, in particular the declining levels of estrogen as a woman approaches ''menopause'', are thought to be the underlying cause of hot flashes. A disorder in thermoregulation (methods the body uses to control and regulate body temperature) is responsible for the heat sensation, but the exact way in which the changing hormone levels affect thermoregulation is not fully understood.''Hot flashes are considered to be a characteristic symptom of the menopausal transition. They also occur in men and in circumstances other than the ''perimenopause'' in women (such as young women or during pregnancy) as a result of certain uncommon medical conditions that affect the process of thermoregulation. For example, the ''carcinoid syndrome'', which results from a type of endocrine ''tumor'' that secretes large amounts of the hormone serotonin can cause hot flashes. Hot flashes can also develop as a side effect of some medications and sometimes occur with severe infections or ''cancers'' that may be associated with ''fevers'' and/or ''night sweats''.'  "
What are signs and symptoms of hot flashes?,"'The timing of the onset of hot flashes in women approaching menopause is variable.'   Hot flashes are typically brief, lasting from about 30 seconds to a few minutes. Redness of the skin, known as flushing, may accompany hot flashes. Excessive perspiration (sweating) can also occur; when hot flashes occur during sleep they may be accompanied by night sweats. Feelings of anxiety may accompany hot flashes. Occasionally, palpitations (feelings of a racing heart beat) may occur during hot flashes. While not all women will experience hot flashes, many normally menstruating women will begin experiencing hot flashes even several years prior to the cessation of menstrual periods. It is impossible to predict if a woman will experience hot flashes, and if she does, when they will begin. About 40% to 85% of women experience hot flashes at some point in the menopausal transition."
How do medical professionals diagnose the cause of hot flashes?,"'Hot flashes are a symptom, not a medical condition. Taking a thorough medical history, the health-care professional will usually be able to determine whether a woman is having hot flashes. The patient will be asked to describe the hot flashes, including how often and when they occur, and if there are other associated symptoms. A physical examination together with the medical history can help determine the cause of the hot flashes and direct further testing if necessary.''Blood tests may be performed if the diagnosis is unclear, either to measure hormone levels or to look for signs of other conditions (such as infection) that could be responsible for the hot flashes.' "
What are the treatments for hot flashes?,"'There are a variety of treatments for hot flashes such as:''Some of these have not been tested by clinical studies, nor are they approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).'   hormone therapy, bioidentical hormone therapy, other drug treatments, complementary and alternative treatments, phytoestrogens, black cohosh, and alternative therapies."
Hormone therapy for hot flashes,"'Traditionally, hot flashes have been treated with either oral or transdermal (such as a patch) forms of estrogen. Hormone therapy (HT) or ''postmenopausal'' hormone therapy (PHT), formerly referred to as ''hormone replacement therapy'' (''HRT''), consists of ''estrogens'' alone or a combination of estrogens and ''progesterone'' (progestin). All available prescription estrogen medications, whether oral or transdermal, are effective in reducing the frequency of hot flashes and their severity. Research indicates that these medications decrease the frequency of hot flashes.''However, long-term studies (the NIH-sponsored '""Women's Health""' Initiative, or WHI) of women receiving combined hormone therapy with both estrogen and progesterone were halted when it was discovered that these women had an increased risk for ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''breast cancer'' when compared with women who did not receive hormone therapy. Later studies of women taking estrogen therapy alone showed that estrogen was associated with an increased risk for ''stroke'', but not for heart attack or ''breast cancer''. Estrogen therapy alone, however, is associated with an increased risk of developing ''endometrial cancer'' (''cancer'' of the lining of the uterus) in postmenopausal women who have not had their uterus surgically removed.''More recently, it has been noted that the negative effects associated with hormone therapy were described in older women who were years beyond menopause, and some researchers have suggested that these negative outcomes might be lessened or prevented if hormone therapy was given to younger women (prior to or around the age of menopause) instead of women years beyond menopause.'""The decision in regard to starting or continuing hormone therapy, therefore, is an individual one in which the patient and doctor must take into account the inherent risks and benefits of the treatment along with each woman's own medical history. It is currently recommended that if hormone therapy is used, it should be used at the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible time."" "
Bioidentical hormone therapy for hot flashes,"'There has been increasing interest in recent years in the use of so-called ""bioidentical"" hormone therapy for perimenopausal women. Bioidentical hormone preparations are medications that contain hormones that have the same chemical formula as those made naturally in the body. The hormones are created in a laboratory by altering compounds derived from naturally-occurring plant products. Some of these so-called bioidentical hormone preparations are U.S. FDA-approved and manufactured by drug companies, while others are made at special pharmacies called compounding pharmacies, which make the preparations on a case-by-case basis for each patient. These individual preparations are not regulated by the FDA, because compounded products are not standardized.''Advocates of bioidentical hormone therapy argue that the products, applied as creams or gels, are absorbed into the body in their active form without the need for ""first pass"" metabolism in the ''liver'', and that their use may avoid potentially dangerous side effects of synthetic hormones used in conventional hormone therapy. However, studies to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of these products have not been carried out.' "
Other prescription drug treatments for hot flashes," The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications have been shown be effective in reducing menopausal hot flashes. These drugs are generally used in the treatment of depression and anxiety as well as other condition. Paroxetine (Brisdelle) is an SSRI approved to treat moderate to severe hot flashes associated with menopause. Clonidine (Catapres) is an anti-hypertensive drug that can relieve hot flashes in some women. Clonidine is taken either by pill or skin patch and decreases blood pressure. Side effects of clonidine can include dry mouth, constipation, drowsiness, or difficulty sleeping. Gabapentin (Neurontin), a drug primarily used for the treatment of seizures, has also been effective in treating hot flashes. Megestrol acetate (Megace) is a progestin that is sometimes prescribed over a short-term to help relieve hot flashes, but this drug is not usually recommended as a first-line treatment for hot flashes. Serious side effects can occur if the medication is abruptly discontinued. Megestrol may have the side effect of weight gain. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) is another progestin drug and is administered by injection to treat hot flashes. It may lead to weight gain as well as bone loss."
What natural and home remedies treat hot flashes?,"'Some women report that ''exercise'' programs or relaxation methods have helped to control hot flashes, but controlled studies have failed to show a benefit of these practices in relieving the symptoms of hot flashes. Maintaining a cool ''sleep'' environment and the use of cotton bedclothes can help ease some of the discomfort associated with hot flashes and associated night sweats.''Many women turn to alternative therapies, including herbal products, ''vitamins'', plant estrogens, and other substances, for the treatment of hot flashes. Doctors can be reluctant to recommend alternative treatments because these nonprescription products are not regulated by the FDA (like prescription medications), and their ingredients and strength can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. For products that are not regulated by the FDA, testing and proof of safety is not required for marketing of these products. Long-term, scientifically controlled studies for these products are either lacking or have not proved the safely and effectiveness of many of the so-called natural or alternative remedies.''Some alternative treatments, however, have been evaluated in well-designed ''clinical trials''. Alternative treatments that have been scientifically studied with some research include phytoestrogens (plant estrogens, isoflavones), black cohosh, and ''vitamin E''.'  "
Black cohosh for hot flashes,"'Black cohosh is an herbal preparation that is becoming more and more popular in the U.S., and the North American Menopause Society does support the short-term use of black cohosh for treating menopausal symptoms, for a period of up to six months (because of its relatively low incidence of side effects when used over the short-term).''Some studies have shown that black cohosh can reduce hot flashes, but most of the studies have not been considered to be rigorous enough in their design to firmly prove any benefit. There also have not been scientific studies done to establish the long-term benefits and safety of this product. Research is ongoing to further determine the effectiveness and safety of black cohosh.' "
Soy and other plant sources for menopause symptoms,"'Isoflavones are chemical compounds found in ''soy'' and other plants (such as chick peas and lentils) that are phytoestrogens, or plant-derived estrogens. They have a chemical structure that is similar to the estrogens naturally produced by the body, but their effectiveness as an estrogen has been determined to be much lower than true estrogens.''Some studies have shown that these compounds may help relieve hot flashes and other ''symptoms of menopause''. In particular, women who have had ''breast cancer'' and do not want to take hormone therapy (HT) with estrogen sometimes use soy products for relief of menopausal symptoms. However, some phytoestrogens can actually have anti-estrogenic properties in certain situations, and the overall risks of these preparations have not yet been determined.''There is also a perception among many women that plant estrogens are ""natural"" and therefore safer than hormone therapy, but this has never been proven scientifically. Further research is needed to fully characterize the safety and potential risks of phytoestrogens.' "
"Other vitamins, herbs, and supplements","'There are many other ''supplements'' and substances that have been used as treatments for symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, including:''For more information, please read our ''Alternative Treatments for Hot Flashes'' article.''Scientific studies to prove the safety and effectiveness of these products in relieving hot flashes have not been adequately performed.' vitamin E, licorice, evening primrose oil, dong quai, chasteberry, and wild yam."
Which type of doctor treats hot flashes?,"'Many women will consult their gynecologist for the management of hot flashes associated with approaching menopause. Hot flashes are also treated by primary care providers, including internists and family practitioners. Hot flashes related to uncommon conditions, serious infections, or cancers are treated by the specialists treating the underlying condition.' "
Is it possible to prevent hot flashes?,"'While the development of hot flashes cannot be prevented, the treatment methods as described in the above section may be able to reduce their incidence and severity.' "
Introduction to men's health,"'The average life expectancy of a man born in the United States in 2016 is 79 years and 8 months. The life expectancy for a man has increased dramatically in the past 50 years. How long we live is important; however, the quality of life is equally important. The ability to enjoy life to its fullest requires investing time and effort into health maintenance and ''disease prevention''. This investment pays dividends almost immediately and it is never too late to begin. A man who was 65 years old in 2018 could expect to live to age 84, and a 75-year-old could expect 11 more years of life.'""Our bodies are incredibly complex machines that require fuel components (food, water, and air) to grow, function, and repair itself. Like any machine, the body requires routine maintenance to make it last a long time and to function well throughout a person's life expectancy. Using the body as it was intended and minimizing abuse also increases its ability to perform. When we buy a car, we expect to routinely change the oil, filters, rotate the tires, and avoid driving too aggressively to keep the car ""'running'' smoothly and last a certain length of time. As in life, accidents happen and cosmetic injuries occur, but it is the ""guts"" of a car, the engine, transmission, and brakes that will decide if it will be happily driving down the road or sitting in the junkyard.'""Our bodies suffer through illnesses and accidents and many are unavoidable. Taking care of your body also includes scheduled maintenance and screening examinations to detect illnesses at an early stage, which increases the potential for cure and a return to health. Learning to listen to the body's warning signs and symptoms is the same as paying attention to the check engine light in your car, neither should be ignored.""'A healthy lifestyle is not just an absence of disease, but an opportunity to enjoy the years of life available to each person. Medical care can help the body maintain its performance as it ages. A ''longer life'' expectancy should not be considered a jail sentence to inactivity. As the body ages, there is an expected and normal physiologic change in some of the hormones in the male body.' "
Prostate problems,"'The prostate is a unique male organ. It is located beneath the bladder and connects it to the penis. Its function is to produce part of the seminal fluid that is alkaline, which helps lengthen the life span of semen when it enters the vagina. The prostate also has involuntary muscles that contract to help expel semen during ejaculation. ''A common condition in men that is part of the normal ''aging'' process is ''benign prostatic hypertrophy'' (''BPH'' or ''enlarged prostate''). The urethra is a tube that passes through the prostate and drains the bladder. A man with an ''enlarged prostate'' (''BPH'') often has difficulty emptying the bladder because the urethra is being compressed by prostatic tissue. This compression of the urethra makes it difficult for the bladder to generate enough pressure to overcome the obstruction (''enlarged prostate''). Over time, the bladder itself begins to weaken making urination even more difficult. ''Symptoms of BPH include:''Treatment of BPH (which may include medications or surgery) depends upon the man, any underlying medical conditions, and the severity of symptoms. '   Urinary frequency (urinating more often) Urinary urgency (the feeling that he has to empty the bladder urgently or risk wetting himself) Urinary hesitancy (difficulty starting the urine stream) Urinary straining (requiring more pressure or bearing down to empty the bladder) Poor urine stream and dribbling"
Testosterone,"'Sexual health'' and function are important parts of a healthy lifestyle. The ability to participate in sexual intercourse depends upon the brain, hormones, nerves, and blood vessels that supply the penis. A variety of mechanisms and feedback loops need to work for an erection to occur. There are numerous causes of ''erectile dysfunction'' (''ED'', ''impotence'') including:''Impotence'' is also a complication of ''prostate cancer'' treatment, which can include surgery and ''radiation''.''Smoking'' is an independent risk factor for developing ''impotence''.''Treatment of ''erectile dysfunction'' depends upon the cause but may include medications (for example, ''tadalafil'' [''Cialis''], ''sildenafil'' [''Viagra''], and ''vardenafil'' [''Levitra'', Staxyn], ''testosterone replacement therapy'' and, for some men, prosthetic devices surgically inserted into the penis.''Testosterone levels that are required for ''puberty'"", muscle, and bone development in young adulthood gradually decrease over a man's lifetime (sometimes referred to as ""'Low T''). Testosterone levels need to be at a certain level to maintain body and brain function. Numerous theories exist about the use of testosterone therapy routinely in older men, but these theories have not been widely accepted. There are however, a few health care practitioners that use testosterone to ""prevent ''aging''.""'  diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis."
Top 10 diseases that kill men,"'""Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster.""''Sun Tzu. Chinese General. 500BC''Most of the common diseases that affect men are potentially preventable, but one needs to know their enemy. Interestingly, the presence of some diseases increases the likelihood that another will occur. ''Heart disease'', ''stroke'', ''peripheral vascular disease'', and ''dementia'' all share the same risk factors: ''The following are the top disease that kill me, according to the Centers for Disease Control.'  smoking, high blood pressure,  high cholesterol, and  family history."
1. Heart disease,"'Heart disease'' is the number one killer of men in the United States. ''The ''heart'"" is like any other muscle, requiring blood to supply oxygen and nutrients for it to function. The heart's needs are provided by the coronary arteries, which begin at the base of the ""'aorta'' and spread across the surface of the heart, branching out to all areas of the heart muscle.''The coronary arteries are at risk for narrowing as ''cholesterol'' deposits, called plaques, build up inside the artery. If the arteries narrow enough, blood supply to the heart muscle may be compromised (slowed down), and this slowing of blood flow to the heart causes ''pain'', or ''angina''.''Angina symptoms include:''This heart ''pain'' is often referred to as ""anginal equivalent.""''A ''heart attack'' (''myocardial infarction'') occurs when a plaque ruptures, allowing a ''blood clot'' to form, which can be life-threatening. The ''blood clot'' completely obstructs the artery, stopping blood flow to part of the heart muscle, and that portion of muscle dies. ''The heart is an electrical pump composed of heart muscle and cells that produce and conduct electrical signals. Heart muscle cells can become irritable because they have lost blood supply and may, in addition, cause electrical abnormalities or short circuits that prevent the heart muscle from pumping which can result in ''sudden cardiac death''.''The major risk factors for ''heart disease'' (and ''stroke'' and peripheral ''vascular disease'') include ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', ''high cholesterol'', ''diabetes'', and family history. While one cannot control their family history, the other factors can be controlled and the risks minimized. These are life-long obligations to decrease the risk of heart disease.' chest pressure with radiation down the arm and to the jaw, shortness of breath, sweating, indigestion, nausea, a decreased ability to do routine activities."
2. Cancers,"'Lung cancer'' is the number one killer among ''cancers'' in men, and most are preventable. Smoking causes 90% of all lung cancers and while the number of ''smokers'' in the United States has decreased in the past generation, 13% of young adults age 18-24 smoke and will be the future victims of ''lung cancer''. It is harder to stop smoking than it is to stop many other addictions; ''nicotine'' in tobacco is a very addictive drug. Tobacco in its various forms including smokeless or ''chewing tobacco'' is related to a variety of other cancers including ''cancer'' of the mouth, throat, and larynx.''Prostate cancer'' affects the ''prostate gland''. Prostate ''cancer'' is the most common ''cancer'' among men, and is a disease of aging and is rarely seen in men younger than 50 years of age. Often prostate ''cancer causes'' no symptoms and is diagnosed with routine screening tests including a rectal examination to feel the prostate and a PSA (''prostate specific antigen'') blood test. The cure rate for prostate cancer has increased since the widespread use of PSA testing began but it still accounts for 19% of cancer deaths among men. Currently,\xa0''prostate cancer screening'' with a digital rectal exam and PSA testing are only indicated in high-risk patients or those with symptoms.''Colon and rectal cancers tie with prostate cancer as the second most common cause of cancer deaths in men. There are few symptoms in the early stages of colon and rectal cancers, thus the diagnosis is often made by routinely screening the ''stool'' for occult blood (blood that is not visible to the naked eye but can be found by testing the ''stool'' sample) and undergoing a routine screening ''colonoscopy''. ''Colon cancer'' can be nearly completely preventable with timely colonoscopy screenings.''Testicular cancer'' accounts for 5.6 per 100,000 men in the U.S., but usually occurs in younger men (ages 15 to 39). Men can help detect this disease by doing a testicular exam routinely and reporting any testicle abnormalities or symptoms (lumps, swelling, pain) to their health care practitioner.''Living a healthy lifestyle decreases the potential risk of developing cancer. Regular ''exercise'', a healthy ''diet'', and avoiding toxins in the environment (including smoking and ''secondhand smoke'') are positive lifestyle changes that the average person can control during their lifetime.' "
3. Injuries,"'Accidents happen and the key to minimizing the risk of death is to use common sense and avoid potentially dangerous situations. ' Simple actions like wearing a seatbelt while in a car, wearing a helmet when cycling, skiing, skateboarding, or other activities 
where head injuries occur help decrease risk of death in an accident.  Driving while impaired on drugs or alcohol is never acceptable and causes a dangerous situation not only for the driver but for those around him. Impairment driving includes not only alcohol but also medications that can cause sedation, including over-the-counter cold and sleep medications. It also includes driving when tired or sleepy. Many authorities on impaired drivers consider texting and cell phone use impaired driving. Most accidents happen around the house and routine prevention can help decrease those accidents. Easy fixes include making sure that floors aren't slippery or wet, stair railings are secure, and walks and driveways are well maintained and well lit at night. Smoke and carbon monoxide detectors can only work if their batteries are fresh. "
"4. Stroke (cerebrovascular accident, CVA)","'A ''stroke'' (''cerebrovascular accident'' [CVA]), occurs when blood supply to part of the brain is disrupted, causing brain cells to die. Blood flow can be compromised by a variety of mechanisms. This can occur because blood supply has been cut off (ischemia) or because there has been bleeding in the brain (hemorrhage). Ischemic ''strokes'' occur due to a variety of reasons including the gradual narrowing of a blood vessel in the brain, debris that can break off from the carotid artery in the neck, or from a blood clot that embolizes (or travels) from the heart. ''The risk factors for ''stroke'' are the same as for heart disease: smoking, ''high blood pressure'', high cholesterol, and family history.''A ''TIA'' (''transient ischemic attack'', ''mini-stroke'') is a stroke that improves, usually quickly. A person develops stroke like symptoms (''weakness'' of one side of the body or face, ''vision loss'', speech difficulty) but it resolves spontaneously within a few minutes or hours. This situation should never be ignored since it is a major warning sign that an impending stroke may occur.' "
5. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),"'Emphysema'' and ''chronic bronchitis'' are the two types of ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD'') and both are most commonly caused by smoking. Due to the toxins in smoke, the lung tissue is damaged and loses its ability to transfer oxygen from the inhaled air into the blood stream. ''Symptoms of COPD'' include shortness of breath and ''wheezing''. ''COPD'' increases the risk of lung infection including ''pneumonia''.' "
6. Diabetes,"'The pancreas makes ''insulin'' to help cells use glucose for energy. ''Diabetes'' describes the situation where insulin function in the body is abnormal.''Poorly controlled diabetes increases blood ''sugar'' levels in the bloodstream and in the long-term, affects the small blood vessels in the body, which can lead to multi-organ failure. Poorly controlled diabetes can cause vascular disease leading to ''heart attacks'', strokes, limb amputations, ''kidney failure'', ''blindness'', and nerve damage (''diabetic neuropathy'').''Diabetes prevention'' and control include eating a well balanced ''diet'', maintaining a healthy weight, and routinely exercising, and keeping active.'  Type 1 diabetes usually occurs in people younger than 40 where the body's immune system destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas. Ninety to 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes."
7. Influenza and pneumonia,"'A healthy lifestyle and healthy body makes for a strong immune system that can fight common infections like ''influenza'' (''flu''). It is important to follow public health recommendations for routine immunizations to reduce the risk of contracting the flu, and its complications such as ''pneumonia''. However, ''pneumonia'' is not limited to just viral causes. Bacterial pneumonia is ranked with influenza as one of the major ''causes of death'' in men by many researchers. Fortunately, a ''pneumococcal vaccine'' has proven effective in preventing one of the most common bacterial causes of pneumonia, ''Streptococcus'' pneumoniae''. ' "
8. Suicide,"'Mens sana in copore sano: a ''healthy mind'' in a healthy body''Thoughts of self harm are not normal. They should not be ignored by a man, family, or friends, and should be considered an emergency situation. ''Depression'' can become overwhelming and potentially life-threatening. Men with ''depression'' may be able to function reasonably well on a day to day basis and may be reluctant to seek help. It may take a crisis situation to finally get a man to agree to get medical, psychological, and counseling assistance.''Symptoms of ''depression'' may be subtle and arise slowly. They can include:' difficulty concentrating or completing projects lack of energy difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much change in appetite (some people stop eating while others overeat) feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness excessive sadness or feelings of emptiness thoughts of suicide or self harm"
9. Kidney disease,"'The kidneys filter impurities from the blood and dispose of them in the urine. They are also important in maintaining ''electrolyte'' balance in the blood. Even in healthy people, aging gradually decreases the efficiency of kidney function. ''Kidney failure'' is often a result of years of poorly controlled ''high blood pressure'' and diabetes.''In the United States, approximately 30 million people have chronic ''kidney disease''.' "
10. Alzheimer's disease,"'Dementia'' and '""Alzheimer's""' disease describes a gradual loss of cognition and intellectual ability including language, attention, memory, and problem solving is an otherwise healthy person. The cause is unknown and there is no cure. Recommendations to decrease the risk of ''dementia'' include avoiding smoking, and keeping ''blood pressure'', high cholesterol, and diabetes under control. Physical and mental ''fitness'' may help prevent dementia; keeping socially active may also help. Recurrent head injuries are associated with dementia. '""Alzheimer's""' disease and dementia are not direct causes of death, but they make it more difficult to identify and treat complications that can lead to death.' "
The checklist: How to stay healthy,"'Being proactive about your health is an important starting point in maintaining health. Some steps are self-evident but a person may need help in taking the first step. The ability to recognize that ''living healthy'' is a life-long commitment is an important key to longevity. Nobody is perfect, and the ultimate goal is to have more good habits than bad. Failing to meet a goal does not give permission to quit trying. Doing well one day is not a license to stray the next.''Here is a checklist to promote a healthier lifestyle and living a longer, healthier life.'   Stop smoking  Maintain a healthy weight  Engage in some type of physical activity every day  Eat a heart healthy diet  Maintain good control of blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes Get routine medical care and physical examinations  Get recommended screenings for prostate and colon cancer  Perform routine home testicle exams Keep mentally active Maintain close relationships with a circle of friends  Seek help if you have symptoms of depression"
What are menstrual cramps? What is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?,"'Menstrual cramps are pains in the abdomen and pelvic areas that can be experienced by a woman because of\xa0''menstrual period''. Menstrual cramps are not the same as the discomfort felt during ''premenstrual syndrome'' (''PMS''), although the symptoms of both disorders can sometimes be experienced as a continuous process. Many women suffer from both ''PMS'' and menstrual cramps.'""Menstrual cramps can range from mild to quite severe. Mild menstrual cramps may be barely noticeable and of short duration. They are sometimes felt as just a sense of heaviness in the abdomen. Severe menstrual cramps can be so painful that they interfere with a woman's normal activities for several days."" "
What are the symptoms of menstrual cramps?,"'Menstrual cramps may be accompanied by a ''headache'' and/or ''nausea'', which can lead, although infrequently, to ''vomiting''. Menstrual cramps can also be accompanied by either ''constipation'' or ''diarrhea'', because the prostaglandins, which cause smooth muscles to contract also affect the intestinal tract. Some women experience an urge to urinate more frequently.'   Menstrual cramps usually begin before the onset of menstrual period, peak within 24 hours after the onset of the bleeding, and subside again after a day or two. Menstrual cramps are pains that begin in the lower abdomen and pelvis. The discomfort can extend to the lower back or legs. Menstrual cramps can be a quite painful or simply a dull ache. The pain can be periodic or continuous. Pain may be felt in the inner thighs, or hips."
How long do menstrual cramps last? Why do they cause severe pain?,"""Menstrual cramps are caused by the uterine contractions that occur in response to prostaglandins and other chemicals. The cramping sensation is intensified when clots or pieces of bloody tissue from the lining of the uterus pass through the cervix, especially if a woman's cervical canal is narrow.""""The difference between menstrual cramps that are more painful and those that are less painful may be related to a woman's prostaglandin levels. Women with menstrual cramps have elevated levels of prostaglandins in the ""'endometrium'' (uterine lining) when compared with women who do not experience cramps. Menstrual cramps are very similar to those a ''pregnant'' woman experiences when she is given prostaglandins as medication to induce ''labor''.''Usually, the strength of menstrual cramps are not measured. Researchers have demonstrated that menstrual cramps can be scientifically documented by measuring the pressure within the uterus, as well as the number and frequency of uterine contractions. During a normal menstrual period, the average woman has contractions of a low pressure (50-80 mm Hg), which last 15-30 seconds at a frequency of 1-4 contractions every 10 minutes. When a woman with dysmenorrhea has menstrual cramps, her contractions are usually of a higher pressure (they may exceed 400 mm Hg), last longer than 90 seconds, and often occur less than 15 seconds apart.'  "
What causes menstrual cramps?,"'Each month, the inner lining of the uterus (the ''endometrium'') normally builds up in preparation for a possible ''pregnancy''. After ''ovulation'"", if the egg is not fertilized by a sperm, no pregnancy will result and the current lining of the uterus is no longer needed. The woman's estrogen and ""'progesterone'' hormone levels decline, and the lining of the uterus becomes swollen and is eventually shed as the menstrual flow. It is replaced by a new growth of lining during the next monthly cycle.''When the uterine lining begins to break down, molecular compounds called prostaglandins are released. These compounds cause the muscles of the uterus to contract. When the uterine muscles contract, they constrict the blood supply (vasoconstriction) to the ''endometrium''. This contraction blocks the delivery of oxygen to the tissue of the endometrium, which in turn, breaks down and dies. After the death of this tissue, the uterine contractions squeeze the old endometrial tissue through the cervix and out of the body by way of the vagina. Other substances known as leukotrienes, which are chemicals that play a role in the inflammatory response, are also elevated at this time and may be related to the development of menstrual cramps.' "
What other factors cause severe pain with menstural cramps?,"   An unusually narrow cervical canal tends to increase menstrual cramps. Another anatomical factor that may contribute to menstrual cramps is a retroverted uterus (the uterus tilts backward instead of forward). Lack of exercise is now recognized to contribute to painful menstrual cramps, because exercise releases endorphins that relieve pain. It has long been thought that psychological factors also play a role. For example, it is widely accepted that emotional stress can increase the discomfort of menstrual cramps. Adenomyosis and endometriosis can increase the severity of menstrual cramps Having uterine fibroids can worsen menstrual cramping"
How common are menstrual cramps?,"'Menstrual cramps of some degree affect an estimated 84% of women, and among these, up to 25% would describe their menstrual cramps as severe. Surveys of adolescent girls show that over 90% report having menstrual cramps.'  "
How are menstrual cramps diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of menstrual cramps is usually made by the woman herself and reflects her individual perception of pain. Once a woman has experienced menstrual cramps, usually with the adolescent onset of her monthly menstrual flow (menses), she becomes well aware of the typical symptoms. If there are other medical conditions contributing to menstrual cramps (secondary dysmenorrhea), the doctor may suggest diagnostic testing including imaging studies.' "
What are the common treatments for menstrural cramps?,"'Every woman needs to find a treatment that works for her. There are a number of possible remedies for menstrual cramps.''Current recommendations include not only adequate rest and ''sleep'', but also regular exercise (especially ''walking''). Some women find that abdominal ''massage'', ''yoga'', or orgasmic sexual activity may bring relief. A heating pad applied to the abdominal area may relieve the pain and ''congestion''.''A number of nonprescription (''over-the-counter'') agents can help control the pain as well as actually prevent the menstrual cramps altogether. For mild cramps, ''aspirin'', ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), or acetaminophen plus a diuretic (Diurex MPR, FEM-1, Midol, Pamprin, Premsyn, and others) may be sufficient. However, aspirin has limited effect in curbing the production of prostaglandin, and it is only useful for less painful cramps.''The main agents for treating moderate menstrual cramps are the ''nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'' (NSAIDs) which lower the production of prostaglandin and lessen its effect. The NSAIDs that do not require a prescription are:''A woman should start taking one of these medications before her pain becomes difficult to control. This might mean starting medication 1 to 2 days before her anticipated period is due, and then continuing taking the medication for the first one to two days of her period. The best results are obtained by taking one of the NSAIDs on a scheduled basis and not waiting for the pain to begin.''Prescription NSAIDs available for the treatment of menstrual cramps include ''mefenamic acid'' (''Ponstel'') and ''meclofenamate'' (''Meclomen'').'   ibuprofen (Advil, Midol IB, Motrin, Nuprin, and others); naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox); and ketoprofen (Actron, Orudis KT)."
What pain relief treatments are used for severe menstrual cramps?,"""If a woman's menstrual cramps are too severe to be managed by these strategies, her doctor might prescribe low doses of ""'birth control pills'' (''oral contraceptives'') containing estrogen and progestin in a regular or extended cycle. This type of approach can prevent ovulation (the monthly release of an egg) and reduce the production of prostaglandins, which in turn, reduces the severity of cramping.''Use of an ''IUD'' that releases small amounts of the progestin ''levonorgestrel'' directly into the uterine ''cavity'', has been associated with a 50 percent reduction in the prevalence of menstrual cramps. In contrast, IUDs that do not contain hormones, such as those containing copper, may worsen menstrual cramps.' "
Can surgery cure menstrual cramps?,"'In the past, many women with menstrual cramps had an operation known as a D & C (''dilation and curettage'') to remove some of the lining of the uterus. This procedure is also sometimes used as a diagnostic measure to detect ''cancer'' or ''precancerous'' conditions of the uterine lining. Some women even resorted to the ultimate solution to menstrual problems by having a ''hysterectomy'', a surgical procedure in which the entire uterus is removed.''Today, when a woman has abnormally heavy and painful uterine bleeding, her doctor may recommend ''endometrial ablation'', a procedure in which the lining of the uterus is destroyed by various devices.' "
What are the treatments for secondary dysmenorrhea (painful periods)?,"'The treatment of secondary dysmenorrhea depends on its cause. There are a number of underlying conditions which can contribute to the pain including:''All of these conditions should be first diagnosed by a physician who will then recommend the optimal treatment.''If a woman begins to experience changes in her menstrual cramps, such as in their severity, timing, or location, she should consult her physician, especially if the changes are of sudden onset.' Endometriosis (cells from the uterine lining are located in other areas of the body outside of the uterus) Uterine fibroids (non-cancerous uterine growths that respond to estrogen levels) Adenomyosis (a benign condition in which the cells of the inner uterine lining invade its muscular wall, the myometrium) Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) Adhesions (abnormal fibrous attachments between organs) Use of a copper intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception."
What is the long-term outlook (prognosis) for menstrual cramps?,"""In general, a woman's menstrual cramps do not worsen during her lifetime. In fact, the menstrual cramps of primary dysmenorrhea usually diminish with age and after pregnancy.""'When there is secondary dysmenorrhea with an underlying condition contributing to the pain, the prognosis depends on the successful treatment of that underlying condition.''As women have learned more about their bodies and how to maintain them in optimal health, menstrual cramps have become less debilitating, and more often, merely a minor monthly inconvenience.' "
What are menstrual cramps?,"'Menstrual cramps are abdominal and pelvic pains experienced by a woman around the time of her ''menstrual period''. Menstrual cramps usually start shortly before the menstrual period, peak within 24 hours after their onset, and subside after a day or two.'""Menstrual cramps can range from mild to severe. Mild menstrual cramps may be barely noticeable, short-lived, and are sometimes felt only as a sense of mild pressure in the abdomen and pelvis. Severe menstrual cramps can be so painful that they interfere with a woman's regular activities for several days. The discomfort can extend to the lower back or legs. Menstrual cramps are not the same as the symptoms experienced due to ""'premenstrual'' syndrome (PMS), although the symptoms of both disorders can sometimes be experienced together. Many women suffer from both PMS and menstrual cramps.''Medical research of menstrual cramps has shown that they are often worse in women who began menstruating early and who have long menstrual periods associated with heavy menstrual flow. ''Smoking'' and a family history of severe menstrual cramps are also associated with severe dysmenorrhea.' "
What is the treatment for common menstrual cramps (primary dysmenorrhea)?,"'Treatment options vary and each woman needs to find the treatment that works best for her. Non-drug measures that may help include adequate rest and ''sleep'', regular ''exercise'' (especially walking), and ''smoking'' cessation. Some women find that abdominal ''massage'', ''yoga'', or orgasmic sexual activity can help. A heating pad applied to the abdominal area may also relieve the ''pain''.''For mild menstrual cramps, ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) aspirin and ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), or acetaminophen plus a diuretic (such as Diurex MPR, Midol, Pamprin, Premesyn) may help. However, aspirin has a limited effect in curbing the production of prostaglandin and is only useful for mild cramps. For moderate menstrual cramps, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be helpful. The NSAIDs are more effective than aspirin in inhibiting the production and action of the prostaglandins. NSAIDs that are available OTC are:''For optimal control of menstrual cramps, a woman should start taking a ''NSAID'' before the onset of her ''pain'' becomes difficult to control. This might mean starting medication 1 to 2 days before the onset of her period and continuing the medication for the first 1 to 2 days of her period. The best results are obtained by taking one of the NSAIDs on a regular schedule rather than on an as needed basis. Therefore, ibuprofen should be taken every 4-6 hours, ketoprofen every 4-8 hours, and naproxen every 8-12 hours for the first few days of the menstrual flow.''Prescription NSAIDs available for the treatment of menstrual cramps include ''mefenamic acid'' (''Ponstel'').' ibuprofen (Advil, Midol IB, Motrin, Nuprin, and others); naproxen sodium (Aleve, Anaprox); and ketoprofen (Actron, Orudis KT)."
What is premenstrual syndrome (PMS)?,"""Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a combination of emotional, physical, psychological, and mood disturbances that occur after a woman's ovulation and normally end with the onset of her menstrual flow.""'PMS remains a puzzle because of the wide-ranging symptoms and the difficulty in making a firm diagnosis. Several theories have been advanced to explain the cause of PMS. None of these theories has been proven and specific treatments for PMS largely lack a solid scientific basis. Most evidence suggests that PMS results from alterations in or interactions among the levels of sex hormones and brain chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters.' "
What treatments are available for PMS?,"'The treatment of PMS can sometimes be as challenging as diagnosing the condition. Some measures lack a solid scientific basis but seem to help some women. Other treatments with a sound scientific basis may not help all patients. General measures include:''Research studies have linked a deficiency of calcium and magnesium to PMS; therefore, it may be beneficial for woman to try ''supplements'' of these nutrients at recommended dosages. Some women have reported relief of symptoms with these ''supplements''. It is always important to follow recommended guidelines when taking vitamin supplements, since taking excess doses of some supplements may be harmful.'  Exercise: Aerobic exercise for 30 minutes 3-5 times a week improves general health and helps relieve nervous tension and anxiety. Exercise also improves cardiovascular fitness and muscle tone, decreases weight and fluid retention, and improves self-esteem. Emotional support from family and friends. Stress reduction and stress management: Learning relaxation techniques, and developing coping mechanisms to reduce stress. Dietary changes: Reduce salt and refined sugar intake (too much salt and refined sugar exacerbates fluid retention). Avoid caffeine, as this may increase irritability Decrease the intake of animal fats. Avoid cigarettes and alcohol."
What medications are used to treat PMS?,"'Medications used to treat the different ''symptoms of PMS'' include taking:' Diuretics, which are medications that increase urine production, thereby eliminating excess fluid and relieving weight gain, bloating, and swelling. Ammonium chloride, caffeine, and pamabrom are mild diuretics that are ingredients in nonprescription OTC products such as Diurex PMS, Lurline PMS, Midol PMS, Pamprin Multisymptom, and Premesyn PMS. Spironolactone (Aldactone) is a prescription diuretic that has been used to treat premenstrual swelling of the hands, feet, and/or face. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) that are commonly used for menstrual cramps, headaches, and pelvic discomfort. NSAIDs are available as both prescription and non-prescription products. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Anaprox), ketoprofen (Orudis), and mefenamic acid (Ponstel). Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) that are sometimes prescribed by doctors to decrease fluctuations in ovarian hormone levels. While older studies failed to provide evidence that OCPs can consistently provide relief for symptoms of PMS, the newer low-dose birth control pills, with their improved hormonal formulations, seem to be more beneficial. Ovarian suppressors such as danazol (Danocrine) have been prescribed by doctors to suppress ovarian hormone production. Danocrine cannot be used over long periods because of side effects. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs, which cause the complete suppression of ovarian function, and have been found to be helpful in treating some women with PMS. These GnRH analogs are not prescribed long term (more than 6 months) because of their adverse effects on bone density and an increased risk of bone thinning (osteoporosis). Antidepressants which are prescribed by doctors to treat the mood disturbances related to PMS. Antidepressants appear to work by increasing brain chemical (serotonin and others) levels that are affected by the ovarian hormones. Fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil). These are examples of antidepressant medications that have been found to be effective in treating the mood changes associated with PMS."
What are some guidelines for the safe use of OTC products for menstrual cramps and PMS?," Always read the labels and know the ingredients in the products. Never take more than the recommended doses without first checking with your doctor. Aspirin and NSAIDs can cause ulcers and should be avoided by patients with known peptic ulcer disease or reflux esophagitis. They can also increase the risk of bleeding and should be avoided by women with certain blood diseases. Women who are scheduled for elective surgery should inform their doctors that they are taking aspirin or NSAIDs. The doctor may ask them to withhold these medications for a period of time prior to the procedure. True aspirin allergy is rare. However, it may lead to hives, difficulty breathing, and/or shock within three hours of ingestion. Aspirin allergy is most common among individuals who have asthma, hives, or nasal polyps. Individuals with true aspirin allergy should also avoid NSAIDs because they are chemically similar to aspirin. Aspirin (and many other medications and some vitamins) can increase the anti-coagulant effect of the blood-thinning medication warfarin (Coumadin) resulting in an increased risk of bleeding. Patients taking warfarin to prevent strokes and other thrombocytic diseases should not use prescription or OTC medications for menstrual cramps or PMS without first checking with the doctor supervising their warfarin dosages. Most healthy adults tolerate aspirin and NSAIDs well, but some may develop side effects such as headaches, dizziness, upset stomach, heartburn, poor appetite, constipation, or diarrhea. Taking these drugs with food can decrease the stomach upset and heartburn. Ammonium chloride, an OTC diuretic, is an acid that can cause stomach upset in high doses. It can also cause an excess accumulation of acid (acidosis) in the blood of patients with kidney and liver disease. Caffeine is a diuretic and a stimulant. It can cause restlessness, anxiety, and insomnia. Nervousness, irritability, and nausea can occur if caffeine-containing foods and beverages are consumed concurrently. Women taking certain asthma medications such as aminophylline or theophylline (Respbid, Slo-Bid, Theo-24, Theoair) should also avoid caffeine."
What should I know about menstruation (monthly period)? What is the medical definition it?*,"'*Medical section written by: Charles Patrick Davis, MD, PhD''Everyone (adolescent boys and girls) who is about to enter ''puberty'' (the process of body changes that cause a child’s body to become an adult body capable of reproduction) should be taught or know the basic medical definition of ''menstruation'' and that it is a normal process that females go through as their bodies prepare themselves for potential ''pregnancy''. It is a part of the monthly menstrual cycle (regular ''cycling'' of hormones) that occur in the ''female reproductive system'' that makes pregnancy possible.''Medically, menstruation (also termed period or bleeding) is the process in a woman of discharging (through the vagina) blood and other materials from the lining of the uterus at about one monthly interval from puberty until ''menopause'' (ceasing of regular menstrual cycles), except during pregnancy. This discharging process lasts about 3-5 days.''Beside the bleeding, other signs and symptoms of menstruation may include ''headache'', ''acne'', ''bloating'', pains in the low abdomen, ''tiredness'', ''mood changes'', food cravings, breast soreness, and ''diarrhea''.''The menstrual cycle is the hormonal driven cycle; Day 1 is the first day of your period (bleeding) while day 14 is the approximate day you ovulate and if an egg is not fertilized, hormone levels eventually drop and at about day 25; the egg begins to dissolve and the cycle begins again with the period at about day 30. Menstruation begins day 1 and normally ends days 3-5 of the menstrual cycle.''At what age do girls go through puberty and begin and start their period (begin to menstruate)?''The average age for a girl to get her first period in the US is 12, but the range of age is about 8 to 15 years old. Women usually have periods until about ages 45 to 55.''The average age for a girl to get her first period in the US is 12, but the range of age is about 8 to 15 years old.

The egg then begins to dissolve and the cycle begins again with the period at about day 30.''Most periods vary somewhat, the flow may be light, moderate or heavy and can vary in length from about 2 to 7 days; with age, the cycle usually shortens and becomes more regular.''Treatment for the causes of menstrual ''pain'' depend on what the cause is, and may include ''birth control pills'', heavy or prolonged periods, IUDs, noninflammatory steroid ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''), for example, ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ), ''aspirin'', ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), and other-the-counter ''pain'' (OTC) medications to relive pain and cramping.''Women should change the pad/tampon before it becomes soaked with blood (about every 4 to 8 hours); follow directions on the box to help avoid ''TSS'' (''toxic shock syndrome''), a potentially deadly disease. Call your doctor or other health professional if you have any abnormalities in your period, for example, excessive bleeding, no periods, severe pain, ''fever'' with tampon use, sudden irregularities, and other problems.' "
What is menstruation? What is the menstrual cycle?,"'Menstruation is bleeding from the vagina that happens about once a month, as a normal part of the menstrual cycle. It is also known as having a period.''During this cycle, your hormones make the lining of the uterus become thicker, getting ready in case of pregnancy. Hormones also cause an egg to be released from an ovary, which is known as ''ovulation''.''If you don’t become ''pregnant'', your periods start about two weeks after you ovulate. The lining of the uterus falls away and, along with some blood, flows out through the vagina. Periods can be light or heavy, and the blood can range from bright red to dark brown. You might also notice small clots.''Girls have their first period during puberty. Most often that is around the age 12 or 13 years old, but girls can start menstruating as young as 9, or as late as 16.''bleeding. When you menstruate, your body sheds the lining of the uterus (womb). Menstrual blood flows from the uterus through the small opening in the cervix and passes out of the body through the vagina. Most menstrual periods last from 3 to 5 days.''Menstruation affects every woman, but the experience can differ between women. When periods (menstruations) come regularly, this is called the menstrual cycle. Having regular menstrual cycles is a sign that important parts of your body are working normally. The menstrual cycle provides important body chemicals, called hormones, to keep you healthy. It also prepares your body for pregnancy each month. A cycle is counted from the first day of 1 period to the first day of the next period. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. Cycles can range anywhere from 21 to 35 days in adults and from 21 to 45 days in young ''teens''. The rise and fall of levels of hormones during the month control the menstrual cycle.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of menstration?,"'Some women get symptoms leading up to and during menstruation, for example, ''cramps'' or pains low in the abdomen, bloating or swelling in the abdomen, ''constipation'' before your period, diarhrea when your period starts, ''acne'', tiredeness, and mood changes.' "
When should you call a doctor for problems with your period?,"'See your doctor about your period if:'   You have not started menstruating by the age of 15. You have not started menstruating within 3 years after breast growth began, or if breasts haven't started to grow by age 13. Your period suddenly stops for more than 90 days. Your periods become very irregular after having had regular, monthly cycles. Your period occurs more often than every 21 days or less often than every 35 days. You are bleeding for more than 7 days. You are bleeding more heavily than usual or using more than 1 pad or tampon every 1 to 2 hours. You bleed between periods. You have severe pain during your period. You suddenly get a fever and feel sick after using tampons."
What age do girls in the U.S. begin their period?,"'In the United States, the average age for a girl to get her first period is 12. This does not mean that all girls start at the same age. A girl can start her period anytime between the ages of 8 and 15. Most of the time, the first period starts about 2 years after breasts first start to develop. If a girl has not had her first period by age 15, or if it has been more than 2 to 3 years since breast growth started, she should see a doctor.'""During your period, you shed the thickened uterine lining and extra blood through the vagina. Your period may not be the same every month. It may also be different than other women's periods. Periods can be light, moderate, or heavy in terms of how much blood comes out of the vagina. This is called menstrual flow. The length of the period also varies. Most periods last from 3 to 5 days. But, anywhere from 2 to 7 days is normal.""  "
When do periods stop?,"'Women usually have periods until ''menopause''. ''Menopause'' occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, usually around age 50. Menopause means that a woman is no longer ovulating (producing eggs) or having periods and can no longer get pregnant. Like menstruation, menopause can vary from woman to woman and these changes may occur over several years.'""For the first few years after menstruation begins, longer cycles are common. A woman's cycle tends to shorten and become more regular with age. Most of the time, periods will be in the range of 21 to 35 days apart.""'Periods stop during pregnancy, and often while you are ''breastfeeding''. Some women find their periods stop for a time because of long-term illness, low body weight, ''stress'', lots of strenuous ''exercise'' and hormone problems. Some medications, such as contraceptives, might stop your period. This can be helpful for some women, especially if their periods are heavy or painful. Sometimes after stopping ''the pill'' or other ''contraceptive'', it can take a while for your periods to come back. Periods stop altogether when women reach menopause - the average age is 51-52.' "
How long is the menstural cycle? How long do periods last?,"'The menstrual cycle is the hormonal driven cycle. Day 1 is the first day of your period (bleeding) while day 14 is the approximate day you ovulate and if an egg is not fertilized, hormone levels eventually drop and at about day 25. The egg then begins to dissolve and the cycle begins again with the period at about day 30.''Most periods vary somewhat, the flow may be light, moderate or heavy and can vary in length from about 2 to 7 days; with age, the cycle usually shortens and becomes more regular.'

What is the treatment for pain and other symptoms caused by menstruation?,"'Treatment for the causes of menstrual pain depend on what the cause is, and may include ''birth control pills'', heavy or prolonged periods, IUDs, noninflammatory steroid drugs (NSAIDs), for example, ibuprofen (Advil), aspirin, naproxen (Aleve), and other-the-counter pain (OTC) medications to relive pain and cramping.' "
What problems occur during menstruation?,"'Problems with periods can include heavy bleeding, period pain (also called dysmenorrhoea), unpredictable or irregular periods, and ''premenstrual syndrome'', or ''PMS'', which makes some women feel irritable and sad and can cause bloating, tender breasts and aching.'  "
How often should I change my pad/tampon?,"'You should change a pad before it becomes soaked with blood. Each woman decides for herself what works best. You should change a tampon at least every 4 to 8 hours. Make sure to use the lowest absorbency tampon needed for your flow. For example, use junior or regular tampons on the lightest day of your period. Using a super absorbency tampon on your lightest days increases your risk for ''toxic shock syndrome'' (''TSS'""). TSS is a rare but sometimes deadly disease. TSS is caused by bacteria that can produce toxins. If your body can't fight the toxins, your immune (body defense) system reacts and causes the symptoms of TSS (see below).""'Young women may be more likely to get TSS. Using any kind of tampon puts you at greater risk for TSS than using pads. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends the following tips to help avoid tampon problems:''If you have any of these symptoms of TSS while using tampons, take the tampon out, and contact your doctor right away:'   Follow package directions for insertion. Choose the lowest absorbency for your flow. Change your tampon at least every 4 to 8 hours. Consider switching between pads and tampons. Know the warning signs of TSS (see below). Don't use tampons between periods. Sudden high fever (over 102 degrees) Muscle aches Diarrhea Vomiting Dizziness and/or fainting Sunburn-like rash Sore throat Bloodshot eyes"
What is mental health?,"'Although it might seem easy to define mental health as the absence of mental illness, most experts agree that there is more to being mentally healthy. The U.S. Surgeon General has defined mental health as ""a state of successful performance of mental function, resulting in productive activities, fulfilling relationships with people, and the ability to adapt to change and to cope with adversity."" The state of being mentally healthy is enviable given the advantages it affords. For example, mentally healthy adults tend to report the fewest health-related limitations of their routine activities, the fewest full or partially missed days of work, and the healthiest social functioning (for example, low helplessness, clear life goals, high resilience, and high levels of intimacy in their lives). ' "
What is mental illness?,"'Mental illness refers to all of the diagnosable mental disorders. Mental disorders are characterized by abnormalities in thinking, feelings, or behaviors. Highly common, about 46% of Americans can expect to meet the formal diagnostic criteria for some form of ''anxiety'', depressive, behavioral, thought, or substance-abuse disorder during their lifetime. ' "
What are common types of mental illness?,"'Some of the most common types of mental illness include ''anxiety'', depressive, behavioral, and substance-abuse disorders. Examples of anxiety disorders include ''phobias'', ''panic disorder'', ''generalized anxiety disorder'' (''GAD''), ''social anxiety disorder'', and ''obsessive compulsive disorder'' (''OCD'""). Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive worry to the point of interfering with the sufferer's ability to function. Examples of anxiety disorders include the following: ""'Behavioral disorders (like ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' [''ADHD''], oppositional defiant disorder, or conduct disorder) are characterized by problems conforming to the tenets of acceptable behavior. The most common behavior disorder is ''ADHD''; this condition includes symptoms of ''inattention'' and/or ''hyperactivity'' and ''impulsivity''. While it used to be considered primarily a disorder of boys, it is now understood to be just as likely to occur in girls and that it can persist into adulthood in about half of ''children with ADHD''. ''Dementia'', including '""Alzheimer's""' ''dementia'', is characterized by a problem with thinking, involving both memory problems and other forms of thinking. These are also known as cognitive problems and include difficulties with language or with identifying or recognizing things despite having no medical cause for these issues such as ''stroke'' or a ''brain tumor''. '""Depressive disorders involve feelings of sadness that interfere with the individual's ability to function or, as with adjustment disorder, persist longer than most people experience in reaction to a particular life stressor. Examples of depressive disorders include the following: ""'Substance use disorders, like ''substance abuse'' and substance dependence, involve the use of a substance that interferes with the social, emotional, physical, educational, or vocational functioning of the person using it. These disorders afflict millions of people and a variety of legal (for example, ''alcohol'' and inhalants like household cleaners) and/or illegal (for example, ''marijuana'' in most states, ''cocaine'', Ecstasy, and opiates) substances may be involved. ''Developmental disorders, like a ''learning disability'"", Asperger's disorder, or mental retardation, are often included in diagnostic manuals for mental disorders, but this group of conditions does not by definition mean the person involved has a problem with their mood. ""'It is important to understand that the list of conditions above is by no means exhaustive. This article focuses on the more common mental illnesses; illnesses like ''eating disorders'' and ''schizophrenia'', that are less common but perhaps quite devastating to the life of the person with the condition, are omitted. ' Phobias: involve severe, irrational fear of a thing or situation. Examples of phobias include fear of heights (acrophobia), spiders (arachnophobia), and of venturing away from home (agoraphobia). Social anxiety disorder is the fear of being in social situations or feeling scrutinized, like when speaking in public. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) tends to result in the person either worrying excessively about many aspects of their life (like about money, family members, the future) or having a free-floating anxiety that is otherwise hard to describe. GAD is quite common, affecting about 10% of the population. Panic disorder is characterized by recurring episodes of sudden, severe, debilitating anxiety (panic) attacks that are immobilizing. Those episodes usually include symptoms like racing heart beat, shortness of breath, stomach upset, and trouble thinking. In order to be diagnosed as having panic disorder, the person must also either worry about having another attack or about what the attack means (for example, wondering if the symptoms of panic indicate they are having a heart attack).  Major depression involves the sufferer feeling depressed most days and for most of each day for at least two weeks in a row. Along with sadness, the individual with major depression experiences a number of other associated symptoms, like irritability, loss of motivation or interest in activities they usually enjoy, hopelessness, and increased or decreased sleep, appetite, and/or weight. The person might also exhibit thoughts, plans, or attempts to harm themselves. Women with postpartum depression tend to experience many of the above symptoms for weeks to months after giving birth. Dysthymia sufferers experience depression and milder levels of the symptoms of major depression. In dysthymia, the symptoms are fairly consistent for more than two years in adults and one year in children and adolescents. Bipolar disorder, also called manic depression, is a mental illness that is characterized by severe mood swings, repeated episodes of depression, and at least one episode of mania in the person's lifetime. Bipolar disorder is one kind of mood disorder that afflicts more than 1% of adults in the United States, up to as many as 4 million people. "
What are the causes and risk factors for mental illness?,"'One frequently asked question about mental illness is if it is hereditary. Most mental disorders are not directly passed from one generation to another genetically, and there is no single cause for mental illness. Rather, it is the result of a complex group of genetic, psychological, and environmental factors. Genetically, it seems that more often than not, there seems to be a genetic predisposition to developing a mental illness. Everything from mood, behavioral, developmental, and thought disorders are thought to have a genetic risk for developing the condition.''Medical conditions may predispose an individual to developing a mental illness. For example, depression is more likely to occur with certain medical illnesses. These ""co-occurring"" conditions include ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', ''diabetes'', ''cancer'', hormonal disorders (especially ''perimenopause'' or ''hypothyroidism'', known as ""low thyroid""), '""Parkinson's""' disease, and '""Alzheimer's""' disease. While it does not appear that ''allergies'' cause depression or visa versa, people who suffer from nonfood ''allergies'' have been found to be somewhat more vulnerable to also having depression compared to people who do not have ''allergies''. Some medications used for long periods, such as ''prednisone'', certain ''blood pressure'' medicines, sleeping pills, antibiotics, and even ''birth control pills'', in some cases, can cause depression or make an existing depression worse. Some antiseizure medications, like ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal''), ''topiramate'' (''Topamax''), and ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin''), may be associated with a higher risk of ''suicide'"". Despite the impact that taking certain medications or having a medical illness can have on a person's emotional state, ""'clinical depression'' should not be considered a normal or natural reaction to either issue. It should therefore always be aggressively treated.''Environmentally, the risks of developing mental illness can even occur before birth. For example, the risk of ''schizophrenia'' is increased in individuals whose mother had one of certain infections during ''pregnancy''. Difficult life circumstances during childhood, like the early loss of a parent, poverty, ''bullying'', witnessing parental violence; being the victim of emotional, sexual, or physical abuse or of physical or emotional neglect; and insecure attachment have all been associated with the development of ''schizophrenia'' as well. Even factors like how well represented an ethnic group is in a neighborhood can be a risk or protective factor for developing a mental illness. For example, some research indicates that ethnic minorities may be more at risk for developing mental disorders if there are fewer members of the ethnic group to which the individual belongs in their neighborhood.''Stress'' has been found to be a significant contributor to the development of most mental illnesses, including ''bipolar disorder''. For example, gay, lesbian, and bisexual people are thought to experience increased emotional struggles associated with the multiple social stressors associated with coping with reactions to their homosexuality or bisexuality in society. Unemployment significantly increases the odds ratio of an individual developing a psychiatric disorder. It almost quadruples the odds of developing drug dependence and triples the odds of having a ''phobia'' or a psychotic illness like schizophrenia. Being unemployed more than doubles the chances of experiencing depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and ''obsessive-compulsive disorder''. ' "
What are symptoms and signs of mental illness?,"""While everyone experiences sadness, anxiety, irritability, and moodiness at times, moods, thoughts, behaviors, or use of substances that interfere with a person's ability to function well physically, socially, at work, school, or home are characteristics of mental illness. Mental illness can have virtually any physical symptom associated with it, from ""'insomnia'', ''headaches'', stomach upset to even ''paralysis''. Socially, the person with a mental illness may avoid or have trouble making or keeping friends. Emotional problems can result in the person being unable to focus and therefore perform at work or school. ' "
How is mental illness diagnosed?,"""There is no one test that definitively indicates that someone has a mental illness. Therefore, health-care practitioners diagnose a mental disorder by gathering comprehensive medical, family, and mental-health information. Patients tend to benefit when the professional takes into account their client's entire life and background. This includes but is not limited to the person's gender, sexual orientation, cultural, religious and ethnic background, and socioeconomic status. The symptom sufferer might be asked to fill out a self-test that the professional will review if the person being evaluated is able to complete it. The practitioner will also either perform a physical examination or request that the individual's primary-care doctor or other medical professional perform one. The medical examination will usually include lab tests to evaluate the person's general health and to explore whether or not the individual has a medical condition that might produce psychological symptoms.""'In asking questions about mental-health symptoms, the counselor or other mental-health professional often explores if the individual suffers from ''hallucinations'' or ''delusions'', depression and/or manic symptoms, anxiety, substance abuse, as well as some personality disorders (for example, ''schizotypal personality disorder'') and developmental disorders (for example, ''autism'' spectrum disorders). Since some of the symptoms of any one mental disorder can also occur in other mental illnesses, the mental-health screening is to determine if the individual suffers from a psychotic depressive, bipolar, anxiety, behavioral, substance abuse, or personality disorder.''In addition to providing treatment that is appropriate to the diagnosis, determining the presence of mental illnesses that may co-occur (be comorbid) and addressing those issues is important when trying to improve the life of individuals with a mental illness. For example, people with schizophrenia are at increased risk of having a substance abuse, depressive, or anxiety disorder and of committing ''suicide''. ' "
What is the treatment for a mental health problem?,"'Psychotherapies'' ''Talk therapy (psychotherapy) is usually considered the first line of care in helping a person with a mental illness. It is an important part of helping individuals with a mental disorder achieve the highest level of functioning possible. These interventions are therefore seen by some as being forms of occupational therapy for people with mental illness. While medication can be quite helpful in alleviating and preventing overt symptoms for many psychiatric conditions, they do not address the many complex social and psychological issues that can play a major role in how the person with such a disease functions at work, at home, and in his or her relationships. For example, since about 60% of people with bipolar disorder take less than 30% of their medications as prescribed, any support that can promote compliance with treatment and otherwise promote the health of individuals in the mentally disordered population is valuable. ''Psychotherapies that have been found to be effective in treating many mental disorders include family focused therapy, psycho-education, cognitive therapy, interpersonal therapy, and social rhythm therapy. Family focused therapy involves education of family members about the disorder and how to help (psycho-education), communication-enhancement training, and teaching family members problem-solving skills training. Psycho-education services involve teaching the person with the illness and their family members about the symptoms of the sufferer, as well as any warning signs (for example, change in ''sleep'' pattern or appetite, increased irritability) that the person is beginning to experience another episode of the illness, when applicable. In ''cognitive behavioral therapy'', the mental-health professional works to help the person with a psychiatric condition identify, challenge, and decrease negative thinking and otherwise dysfunctional belief systems. The goal of interpersonal therapy tends to be identifying and managing problems the sufferers of a mental illness may have in their relationships with others. Social rhythm therapy encourages stability of sleep-wake cycles, with the goal of preventing or alleviating the sleep disturbances that may be associated with a psychiatric disorder. ''Medications may play an important role in the treatment of a mental illness, particularly when the symptoms are severe or do not adequately respond to psychotherapy. For example, treatment of bipolar disorder with medications tends to address two aspects: relieving already existing symptoms of mania or depression and preventing symptoms from returning. Medications that are thought to be particularly effective in treating manic and mixed symptoms include ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), ''ziprasidone'' (''Geodon''), ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), paliperidone (Invega), and asenapine (Saphis). These medications belong to a group of medications called neuroleptics and are known for having the ability to work quickly compared to many other psychiatric medications. As a group of medications, side effects that occur most often include sleepiness, ''dizziness'', and ''increased appetite''. ''Weight gain'', which may be associated with higher blood ''sugar'', higher ''lipid'' levels, and sometimes increased levels of a hormone called ''prolactin'' may also occur. Although older medications in this class that were not mentioned here are more likely to cause muscle ''stiffness'', shakiness, and very rarely uncoordinated muscle twitches (''tardive dyskinesia'') that can be permanent, health-care practitioners appropriately monitor the people they treat for these potential side effects as well. Mood-stabilizer medications like ''lithium'', ''divalproex'' (''Depakote''), ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol''), and lamotrigine (Lamictal) can be useful in treating active (acute) symptoms of manic or mixed episodes. These medications may take a bit longer to work compared to the neuroleptic medications, and some (for example, lithium, divalproex, and carbamazepine) require monitoring of medication blood levels. Further, some of these medications can be associated with ''birth defects'' when taken by ''pregnant'' women. ''Antidepressant'' medications are the primary medical treatment for the anxiety characterized by anxiety disorders, as well as the depressive symptoms of depressive disorders and bipolar disorder. Examples of those medications that are commonly prescribed for those purposes include serotonergic (SSRI) medications like ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''paroxetine'' (''Paxil''), ''citalopram'' (''Celexa''), and ''escitalopram'' (''Lexapro'') and combination serotonergic/adrenergic medications (SNRIs) like ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor'') and ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), as well as buproprion (''Wellbutrin''), which is a dopaminergic antidepressant. ''Medications like ''clonazepam'' (''Klonopin'') and ''lorazepam'' (''Ativan'') from the ''benzodiazepine'' group are often used to treat anxiety, particularly when it is sudden and severe, as in ''panic attacks''. This class of medications does have addictive properties. Medications from the ''beta-blocker'' family (for example, ''propranolol'' [''Inderal'']) are sometimes used to treat the physical symptoms associated with anxiety as well. '""Alzheimer's and other forms of ""'dementia'' are often treated with medications like ''memantine'' (''Namenda''), ''galantamine'' (''Razadyne''), donezepil (''Aricept''), ''rivastigmine'' (''Exelon''), and ''tacrine'' (Cognex). These medications tend to slow the progression of dementia, thereby helping sufferers of dementia remain functional longer than they would without treatment. ''Despite its stigmatized history, ''electroconvulsive therapy'' (''ECT'"") can be a viable treatment for people whose symptoms of depression, bipolar, or thought disorder have inadequately responded to psychotherapies and a number of medication trials. Although alternative treatments for mood disorders like St. John's wort or ""'ginkgo'' biloba are not recognized standard care for bipolar disorder, as many as one-third of some patients being treated for a mental illness use them. ' "
Can mental health disorders be prevented?,"'A variety of factors can contribute to the prevention of mental-health disorders. For example, people who feel less isolated and alone tend to be less likely to develop a mental-health disorder. Those who engage in regular practice of endurance ''exercise'' seem to have a more favorable self-image, more resistance to drug and alcohol ''addiction'', and a higher sense of general physical and psychological well-being compared to those who do not ''exercise'' regularly. Adolescents who engage regularly in physical activity are characterized by lower levels of anxiety and depression compared to their more sedentary counterparts.''Clear communication by parents about the negative effects of alcohol, as well as about their expectations regarding ''drug use'', has been found to significantly decrease alcohol and other drug use in ''teens'"". Adequate parental supervision has also been found to be a deterrent to substance use in children and adolescents. Alcohol and other drug use has been found to occur most often between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., immediately after school and prior to parents' arrival home from work. Teen participation in extracurricular activities has therefore been revealed to be an important measure in preventing use of alcohol in this age group. Parents can also help educate teens about appropriate coping and ""'stress''-management strategies. For example, 15- to 16-year-olds who use religion to cope with stress tend to use ''drugs'' significantly less often and have less problems as a result of drinking than their peers who do not use religion to cope.' "
What is the prognosis for mental-health problems?,"'Individuals with mental illness are at risk for a variety of challenges. For example, children who have either a father or mother who have been psychiatrically hospitalized seem to be at higher risk of dying from ''sudden infant death syndrome'' (''SIDS''). Depression in adults can lead to a significantly greater likelihood of health risk factors such as a lack of physical activity, ''smoking'', binge drinking, ''obesity'', ''high blood pressure'', ''high cholesterol'', and poor health. Fortunately, treatment for mental illness can go a long way to restoring the emotional and behavioral health of individuals with mental illness.' "

What Causes Mental Illness?,"'Although the exact cause of most mental illnesses is not known, it is becoming clear through research that many of these conditions are caused by a combination of genetic, biological, psychological, and environmental factors -- not personal ''weakness'' or a character defect -- and recovery from a mental illness is not simply a matter of will and self-discipline. ' Heredity (genetics): Many mental illnesses run in families, 
	suggesting they may be passed on from parents to children through genes. 
	Genes contain instructions for the function of each cell in the body and are 
	responsible for how we look, act, think, etc. However, just because your 
	mother or father may have or had a mental illness doesn't mean you will have 
	one. Hereditary just means that you are more likely to get the condition 
	than if you didn't have an affected family member. Experts believe that many 
	mental conditions are linked to problems in multiple genes -- not just one, 
	as with many diseases -- which is why a person inherits a susceptibility to 
	a mental disorder but doesn't always develop the condition. The disorder 
	itself occurs from the interaction of these genes and other factors -- such 
	as psychological trauma and environmental stressors -- which can influence, 
	or trigger, the illness in a person who has inherited a susceptibility to 
	it. Biology: Some mental illnesses have been linked to an abnormal 
	balance of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters help 
	nerve cells in the brain communicate with each other. If these chemicals are 
	out of balance or are not working properly, messages may not make it through 
	the brain correctly, leading to symptoms of mental illness. In addition, 
	defects in or injury to certain areas of the brain also have been linked to 
	some mental conditions.  Psychological trauma: Some mental illnesses may be triggered by 
	psychological trauma suffered as a child, such as severe emotional, 
	physical, or sexual abuse; a significant early loss, such as the loss of a 
	parent; and neglect.  Environmental stressors: Certain stressors -- such as a death or 
	divorce, a dysfunctional family life, changing jobs or schools, and 
	substance abuse -- can trigger a disorder in a person who may be at risk for 
	developing a mental illness."
Can Mental Illness Be Prevented?,"'Unfortunately, most mental illnesses are caused by a combination of factorsand cannot be prevented.' "
How Common Is Mental Illness?,"'Mental illnesses are very common. In fact, they are more common than ''cancer'',  ''diabetes'', or ''heart disease''. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, about 25% of American adults (those ages 18 and older) and about 13% of American children (those ages 8 to 15) are diagnosed with a mental disorder during a given year. ''Major depression'', ''bipolar disorder'', and ''schizophrenia'"" are among the U.S.'s top 10 leading causes of disability. ""'Mental illness does not discriminate. It can affect people of any age, income or educational level, and cultural background. Although mental illness affects both males and females, certain conditions -- such as ''eating disorders'' -- tend to occur more often in females, and other disorders -- such as ''attention deficit''''hyperactivity'' disorder (''ADHD'') -- more commonly occur in children. ' "
How Is Mental Illness Treated?,"'A mental illness, like many chronic illnesses, requires ongoing treatment. Fortunately, much progress has been made in the last two decades in treating mental illnesses. As a result, many mental conditions can be effectively treated with one or a combination of the following therapies: ''Other treatments available include: ' Medication. Psychotherapy. Group therapy. Day treatment or partial hospital treatment. Specific therapies, such as cognitive-behavior therapy and behavior 
	modification. Alternative therapies, such as water therapy, massage, and biofeedback. Creative therapies, such as art therapy, music therapy, or play therapy. Hypnotherapy. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a newer therapy."
What Is the Outlook for People with Mental Illness?,"'When diagnosed early and treated properly, many people fully recover from their mental illness or are able to successfully control their symptoms. Although some people become disabled because of a chronic or severe mental illness, many others are able to live full and productive lives. In fact, as many as 8 in 10 people suffering from a mental illness can effectively return to their normal activities if they receive appropriate treatment.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
Facts you should know about mental illness in children,"  Mental disorders in children are quite common, occurring in about one-quarter of this age group in any given year. The most common childhood mental disorders are anxiety disorders, depression, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although less common, developmental disorders and psychotic disorders in children can have a lifelong impact on the child and his or her family. As in any age group, there tends to be no single cause for mental illness in children. In addition to the specific symptoms of each mental disorder, children with a psychiatric illness can exhibit signs that are specific to their age and developmental status. Establishing the diagnosis of a mental illness in children usually involves the combination of comprehensive medical, developmental, and mental health assessments. There are varieties of treatments available for managing mental illness in children, including several effective medications, educational or occupational interventions, as well as specific forms of psychotherapy. Children with mental health problems can have lower educational achievement, greater involvement with the criminal justice system, and fewer stable placements in the child welfare system than their peers. Attempts at prevention of childhood mental illness tend to address both specific and nonspecific risk factors, strengthen protective factors, and use an approach that is appropriate for the child's developmental level. Research on mental illness in children focuses on a number of issues, including increasing the understanding of how often these illnesses occur, the risk factors, most effective treatments, and how to improve the access that children have to those treatments."
What are the most common types of mental illnesses in children?,"'Mental disorders in children are quite common and sometimes severe. About one-fourth of children and ''teens'' experience some type of mental disorder in any given year, one-third at some time in their lives. The most common kind of mental disorders are ''anxiety'' disorders, like ''generalized anxiety disorder'' (formerly called overanxious disorder of childhood) or ''separation anxiety'' disorder. Other common types of mental illnesses in childhood include behavior disorders like ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD''), mood disorders like ''depression'', and substance-use disorders like ''alcohol'' use disorders. Statistics indicate how relatively common these disorders occur. ''ADHD'' affects 8%-10% of school-aged children. ''Depression'' occurs at a rate of about 2% during childhood and from 4%-7% during adolescence, affecting up to about 20% of adolescents by the time they reach adulthood. In teens more frequently than in younger children, addictions, ''eating disorders'', ''bipolar disorder'', and less often early onset ''schizophrenia'' may manifest.''Although not as commonly occurring, developmental disabilities like ''autism'' spectrum disorders can have a significant lifelong impact on the life of the child and his or her family. ''Autism spectrum disorder'' is a developmental disorder characterized by impaired development in communication, social interaction, and behavior. Statistics about ''autism'' spectrum disorders include that it afflicts one out of every 59 children, a 15% increase from 2016-2018.' "
What are symptoms and signs of mental illness in children?,"'Children with mental illness may experience the classic symptoms of their particular disorder but may exhibit other symptoms as well, including''Examples of risk-taking behaviors include ''running'' into the street, climbing too high, engaging in physical altercations, or playing with unsafe items.'   poor school performance; persistent boredom; frequent complaints of physical symptoms, such as headaches and stomachaches; sleep and/or appetite problems like sleeping too much or too little, nightmares, or sleepwalking; behaviors returning to those of a younger age (regressing), like bedwetting, throwing tantrums, or becoming clingy; noncompliant or aggressive behaviors; and more risk-taking behaviors and/or showing less concern for their own safety."
What are causes and risk factors for mental illness in children?,"'As is the case with most mental health disorders at any age, such disorders in children do not have one single definitive cause. Rather, people with these illnesses tend to have a number of biological, psychological, and environmental risk factors that contribute to their development. Biologically, mental illnesses tend to be associated with abnormal levels of neurotransmitters, like serotonin or ''dopamine'' in the brain, a decrease in the size of some areas of the brain, as well as increased activity in other areas of the brain. Physicians are more likely to diagnose girls with mood disorders like ''depression'' and ''anxiety'' compared to boys, while disorders like ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' and ''autism'' spectrum disorders are more often assigned to boys. Gender differences in mental illness are the result of, among other things, a combination of biological differences based on gender, as well as the differences in how girls are encouraged to interpret their environment and respond to it compared to boys. There is thought to be at least a partially genetic contribution to the fact that children and adolescents with a mentally ill parent are up to four times more likely to develop such an illness themselves. Teens who develop a mental disorder are also more prone to having had other biological challenges, like low birth weight, trouble sleeping, and having a mother younger than 18 years old at the time of their birth.''Psychological risk factors for mental illness in children include low self-esteem, poor ''body image'', a tendency to be highly self-critical, and feeling helpless when dealing with negative events. Teen mental disorders are somewhat associated with the ''stress'' of body changes, including the fluctuating hormones of ''puberty'', as well as teen ambivalence toward increased independence, and with changes in their relationships with parents, peers, and others. Teenagers who suffer from conduct disorder, ''attention deficit'' ''hyperactivity'' disorder (ADHD), clinical ''anxiety'', or who have cognitive and learning problems, as well as trouble relating to others are at higher risk of also developing a mental disorder.''Childhood mental illness may be a reaction to environmental stresses, including ''trauma'' like being the victim of verbal, physical, or sexual abuse, the death of a loved one, school problems, or being the victim of ''bullying'' or peer pressure. Gay teens are at higher risk for developing mental disorders like depression, thought to be because of the bullying by peers and potential rejection by family members. Children in military families are at risk for experiencing depression as well.''The aforementioned environmental risk factors tend to predispose individuals to childhood mental illness. Other risk factors tend to predispose people to developing a mental disorder at any age. Such nonspecific risk factors include a history of poverty, exposure to violence, having an antisocial peer group, or being socially isolated, abuse victimization, parental conflict, and family dissolution. Children who have low physical activity, poor academic performance, or lose a relationship are at higher risk for mental illness as well.' "
"How do health care 
professionals diagnose mental illness in children?","'Many health care professionals may help make the diagnosis of a mental illness in children, including licensed mental health therapists, pediatricians or other primary care providers, emergency physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, physician assistants, and social workers. One of these professionals will likely conduct an extensive medical interview and physical examination or refer the child for those assessments as part of establishing the diagnosis.''Childhood mental illnesses may be associated with a number of other medical conditions or can be a side effect of various medications. For this reason, health care professionals perform routine laboratory tests during the initial evaluation to rule out other causes of symptoms. Occasionally, it may be necessary to get an X-ray, scan, or other imaging study. As part of this examination, a health care provider may ask the child and his or her parents a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help further assess symptoms. The use of screening tools is particularly important for detecting early signs of mental illness in infants and toddlers, due to their being largely preverbal in their communication.' "
What is the treatment for mental illness in children?,"'There are varieties of treatments available for managing mental illnesses in children, including educational or occupational interventions, specific forms of psychotherapy, and several effective medications. In terms of medications, medications from specific drug classes treat childhood mental illness. Examples include stimulant and nonstimulant classes of medications for treating ADHD, serotonergic medications for treating depression and anxiety, and neuroleptic medications for management of severe ''mood swings'', anxiety, aggression, or in the treatment of childhood ''schizophrenia''.''For individuals who may be wondering how to manage the symptoms of a childhood mental illness using treatment without prescribed medications, psychotherapies are often used. While interventions like limiting exposure to food additives, preservatives, and processed sugars have been found to be helpful for some people with an illness like ADHD, the research evidence is still considered to be too limited for many physicians to recommend nutritional interventions. Also, placing such restrictions on the eating habits of a child or teenager can prove to be difficult and contentious at best, nearly impossible at worst.''Psychotherapy (""talk therapy"") is a form of mental health counseling that involves working with a trained therapist to figure out ways to solve problems and cope with childhood ''emotional disorders''. It can be a powerful intervention, even producing positive biochemical changes in the brain. Two major approaches treat childhood mental illness, interpersonal psychotherapy and ''cognitive behavioral therapy''. In general, these therapies take several weeks to months to complete. Each has a goal of alleviating symptoms. More intense psychotherapy may be needed for longer periods when treating very severe mental illness.''The behavioral, educational/vocational, and psychotherapy components of treatment for childhood mental illnesses are usually at least as important as the medication treatment. Dealing with the specific challenges that mentally ill children present takes patience, understanding, and a balance of structure and flexibility. One kind of psychotherapy used to treat children with mental illness is cognitive behavioral therapy (''CBT''). This form of therapy seeks to help those with many different kinds of psychiatric disorders identify and decrease the irrational thoughts and behaviors that reinforce maladaptive behaviors. Health care professionals administer this therapy either individually or in group therapy. CBT that seeks to help the sufferer of many childhood mental illnesses may decrease the tendency of the ''depressed'' or anxious child to pay excessive attention to potential threats, while helping the child with ADHD appropriately refocus their attention.''Behavioral techniques that health care providers often use to decrease symptoms in children with behavioral disorders like ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, or conduct disorder or to help children with anxiety disorders like separation ''anxiety disorder'' or ''obsessive compulsive disorder'"" involve the parents, teacher, and other adult caretakers understanding the circumstances surrounding both positive and negative behaviors and how each kind of behavior is encouraged and discouraged. Specifically, learning why, when, and where specific behaviors occur can go a long way toward understanding how to encourage the behavior to happen again if it's positive or extinguishing it if the behavior is negative. Being aware of how the reactions of others contribute to a behavior's continuing or not continuing tend to help the child with a behavior disorder shape their behaviors more positively. Also, developing a fair, meaningful, timely, and effective repertoire of ways to encourage positive behaviors and provide consequences for negative behaviors is a key component of any behavior-management plan and therefore in ""'parenting'' children with behavioral disorders.''Often, a combination of medication and nonmedication interventions produces good results in helping the child with a mental illness. Depending on the illness, the length of time it existed before treatment starts, as well as the course of treatment deemed most appropriate, improvement may be noticed in a fairly short period of time, from two to three weeks to several months. Thus, appropriate treatment for mental illness can relieve symptoms or at least substantially reduce their severity and frequency, bringing significant relief to many children. There are also things that families of children with a mental illness can do to help make treatment more effective. Tips to manage symptoms of most childhood mental health problems include getting adequate ''sleep'', having a healthy ''diet'' and adequate ''exercise'', as well as having the support and encouragement of parents and teachers.''If symptoms indicate that your child is suffering from mental illness, the health care professional will likely strongly recommend treatment. Treatment may include addressing any medical conditions that cause or worsen the psychiatric symptoms. For example, an individual who is depressed and found to have low levels of ''thyroid hormone'' might receive hormone replacement with levothyroxine (''Synthroid'', ''Levoxyl''). People may find that a hyperactive, anxious, or psychotic child is having a reaction to a medication. Other components of treatment may be supportive therapy, such as changes in lifestyle and behavior, psychotherapy, and may include medication for moderate to severe mental illness. If symptoms are severe enough to warrant treatment with medication, symptoms tend to improve faster and for longer with medication treatment and psychotherapy.''Interpersonal therapy'' (IPT): This helps to alleviate symptoms of mood disorders like anxiety and depression and helps the sufferer develop more effective skills for coping with relationships. IPT employs two strategies to achieve these goals:''Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): This has been found to be effective as part of treatment for childhood mental illness. This approach helps to alleviate depression, anxiety, and some behavioral problems and reduce the likelihood that symptoms will come back by helping the child change his or her way of thinking about or otherwise reacting to certain issues. In CBT, the therapist uses three techniques to accomplish these goals:'""Most practitioners will continue treatment of a mental illness for at least six months. Treatment for children with a mental illness can have a significantly positive effect on the child's functioning with peers, family, and at school. Without treatment, symptoms tend to last much longer and may never get better. In fact, they may get worse. With treatment, chances of recovery are much improved.""'The major type of ''antidepressant'' and anti-anxiety medication prescribed for children is the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRI medications affect levels of serotonin in the brain. For many prescribing doctors, these medications are the first choice because of the high level of effectiveness and general safety of this group of medicines. Examples of medications in this class approved for use in children are listed here. The generic name is first, with the brand name in parentheses.''The medications available for ''attention deficit'' hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can have slightly different effects from individual to individual, and currently no way exists to tell which will work best. Medications indicated for ADHD work by improving the imbalance of neurochemicals that are thought to contribute to ADHD. Some commonly prescribed medications include the following:''Treatment of ''bipolar disorder'' with medications tends to address two aspects: relieving already existing symptoms of ''mania'' or depression and preventing symptoms from returning. Medications that are thought to be particularly effective in treating ''manic'' and mixed symptoms and have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children (in children 10 years of age and older) include''For treatment of irritability in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, Risperdal has been FDA approved in children 5 years of age and older, while Abilify has been approved in children 6 years of age and older.'  The first is educating the child and family about the nature of their illness. The therapist will emphasize that depression is a common illness and that most people can expect to get better with treatment. The second is defining problems (such as abnormal grief, interpersonal conflicts, or having significant anxiety when meeting new people). After the problems are defined, the therapist is able to help set realistic goals for solving these problems and work with the child and his or her family using various treatment techniques to reach these goals. Didactic component: This phase helps to set up positive expectations for therapy and promote the child's cooperation with the treatment process. Cognitive component: This helps to identify the thoughts and assumptions that influence the child's behaviors, particularly those that may predispose the sufferer to having the emotional or behavioral symptoms that they have. Behavioral component: This employs behavior-modification techniques to teach the child more effective strategies for dealing with problems.

What is the prognosis of mental illness in children?,"'Children and youth with mental health problems are at risk for having lower educational achievement, greater involvement with the criminal justice system, and fewer stable and longer-term placements in the child welfare system than their peers. Children and youth with mental health problems are more likely to experience problems at school, be absent, or be suspended or expelled than are children with other disabilities. Youth in high school with mental health problems are more likely to fail or drop out of school. When treated, children and youth with mental health problems fare better at home, in schools, and in their communities.''Children with more anxiety disorders are at higher risk for anxiety, depression, and substance-abuse disorders in adulthood. They tend to achieve less academically and are more likely to engage in early parenthood and ''suicidal'' behaviors.''Depression can be quite chronic, in that 85% of people who have one episode of the illness will have another one within 15 years of the first episode. A bit over 50% of teens who are part of research studies on the treatment of depression improve significantly. Over 8% of adolescents suffer from depression that lasts a year or more. Depression is the leading cause of disability in the United States in people over 5 years of age. This illness is a leading cause of health impairment (morbidity) and death (mortality). Certainly, the worst potential outcome of depression, ''suicide'' is the third leading cause of death in teens.''About half of children diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are thought to continue to have significant symptoms of the disorder into adulthood. Of those individuals, about half tend to exhibit less overt hyperactivity than they did as children. People with this disorder are at higher risk for lower educational achievement as children, job and relationship loss, as well as experiencing more automobile accidents and ''drug use'' as teens and adults, particularly if left untreated.''While the prognosis for ''bipolar disorder'' indicates that individuals with this disorder can expect to experience episodes of some sort of mood problem up to 60% of the time, comprehensive treatment can manage those episodes. There are a number of potential complications of bipolar disorder, particularly if left untreated. Other mental health problems, including ''substance abuse'' and ''addiction'', may compound this illness. The risk of committing ''suicide'' is 60 times higher for people with bipolar disorder compared to the general population. Bipolar disorder is the fifth leading cause of disability and the ninth leading cause of years lost to death or disability worldwide.' "
Is it possible to prevent mental illness in children?,"""Attempts at prevention of childhood mental illness tends to address both specific and nonspecific risk factors, strengthen protective factors, and use an approach that is appropriate for the child's age and developmental level. Such programs often use cognitive behavioral and/or interpersonal approaches, as well as family based prevention strategies because research shows that these interventions tend to be the most helpful.""""The inverse of most risk factors, protective factors for childhood mental illness include preventing exposure to community violence, having the involvement of supportive adults, strong, consistent family and peer relationships, healthy coping skills, and emotional regulation. Children and adolescents of a mentally ill parent tend to be more resilient when the child is more able to focus on age-appropriate tasks in their lives and on their relationships, as well as being able to understand their parents' illness. For mentally ill parents, their children seem to be more protected from developing a psychiatric illness when the parent is able to demonstrate a commitment to parenting and to ""'healthy relationships''.'

What is the latest research on mental illness in children?,"'Due to the historical lack of understanding of this topic, research on mental illness in children is occurring on a number of fronts. In an effort to understand how often childhood mental illnesses occur, a great deal of research is focused on achieving that goal. Understanding more about the protective factors against mental illness is being explored. Ways to improve the access that children have to treatment is another topic of considerable research interest.' "

What is meralgia paresthetica?," Meralgia paresthetica is an entrapment or ""pinching"" of the nerve that supplies sensation to the outer portion of the thigh. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve becomes ""entrapped"" as it passes under the ligament of the groin. The pressure on the nerve causes abnormal sensations of burning, pain, and numbness in the distribution of this nerve, the outer and part of the front of the thigh. Meralgia paresthetica is also known as lateral femoral cutaneous nerve syndrome."
What causes meralgia paresthetica?,"'Causes of meralgia paresthetica include any condition that leads to an increase in pressure on the groin (usually associated with enlargement of the belly, such as in ''obesity'' or ''pregnancy'').' "
What is the treatment for meralgia paresthetica?,"'The treatment of meralgia paresthetica usually involves addressing the underlying cause. Meralgia paresthetica can also be treated by local ''cortisone injection'' at the point where the nerve crosses the crease in the groin. Medications commonly utilized in the treatment of ''neuropathic pain'', such as ''gabapentin'', may be used. Infrequently, surgical release of the nerve is necessary.'  "
What is mercury?,"'Mercury is a naturally occurring element. It is contained in some of the fish we eat, whether caught in local lakes and streams or bought in a grocery store. Mercury is also contained in some of the products we use, which may be found in your home, at the dentist, and at schools. This article provides links to information about sources of mercury exposure, potential health effects, fish that may contain mercury, consumer products that contain mercury, and ways to reduce your exposure to mercury. ' "
What are the forms sources of mercury?,"'Forms of mercury.'' Mercury is a naturally occurring element that is found in air, water and soil. It exists in three chemical forms. They each have specific effects on human health. ''Sources of mercury.'"" Mercury is an element in the earth's crust. Humans cannot create or destroy mercury. Pure mercury is a liquid metal, sometimes referred to as quicksilver that volatizes readily. It has traditionally been used to make products like thermometers, switches, and some light bulbs. ""'Mercury is found in many rocks including coal.'' When coal is burned, mercury is released into the environment. Coal-burning power plants are the largest human-caused source of mercury emissions to the air in the United States, accounting for over 40 percent of all domestic human-caused mercury emissions. EPA has estimated that about one quarter of U.S. emissions from coal-burning power plants are deposited within the contiguous U.S. and the remainder enters the global cycle. Burning hazardous wastes, producing chlorine, breaking mercury products, and spilling mercury, as well as the improper treatment and disposal of products or wastes containing mercury, can also release it into the environment. Current estimates are that less than half of all mercury deposition within the U.S. comes from U.S. sources. ''Exposure to mercury.'' Mercury in the air eventually settles into water or onto land where it can be washed into water. Once deposited, certain microorganisms can change it into methylmercury, a highly toxic form that builds up in fish, shellfish and animals that eat fish. Fish and shellfish are the main sources of methylmercury exposure to humans. Methylmercury builds up more in some types of fish and shellfish than others. ''Fish that typically have higher levels of mercury include ''Many of these types of fish are used in sushi. White albacore canned tuna typically has three times as much mercury as chunk light canned tuna. The levels of methylmercury in fish and shellfish depend on what they eat, how long they live and how high they are in the food chain. ''EPA works with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and with states and tribes to issue advice to women who may become ''pregnant'', pregnant women, ''nursing'' mothers, and parents of young children about how often they should eat certain types of commercially-caught fish and shellfish. Fish advisories are also issued for men, women, and children of all ages when appropriate. In addition, EPA releases an annual summary of information on locally-issued fish advisories and safe-eating guidelines to the public. Fish is a beneficial part of the ''diet'', so EPA & FDA encourage people to continue to eat fish that are low in methylmercury. ''Another less common exposure to mercury that can be a concern is ''breathing'' mercury vapor. These exposures can occur when elemental mercury or products that contain elemental mercury break and release mercury to the air, particularly in warm or poorly-ventilated indoor spaces. ''Health effects of mercury. '""Mercury exposure at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune system of people of all ages. Research shows that most people's fish consumption does not cause a health concern. However, it has been demonstrated that high levels of methylmercury in the bloodstream of unborn babies and young children may harm the developing nervous system, making the child less able to think and learn. ""'Ecological effects of mercury.'"" Birds and mammals that eat fish are more exposed to mercury than other animals in water ecosystems. Similarly, predators that eat fish-eating animals may be highly exposed. At high levels of exposure, methylmercury's harmful effects on these animals include death, reduced reproduction, slower growth and development, and abnormal behavior. ""'Reducing mercury releases.'' EPA issues regulations that require industry to reduce mercury releases to air and water and to properly treat and dispose of mercury wastes. EPA also works with industry to promote voluntary reductions in mercury use and releases, and with partners in state, local and tribal governments to improve their mercury reduction programs. EPA works with international organizations to prevent the release of mercury in other countries. The public can contribute to mercury reduction efforts by purchasing mercury-free products and correctly disposing of products that contain mercury by reducing demand for products whose production leads to the release of mercury into the environment.'

What factors determine the severity of health effects from mercury exposure?,"""People in the U.S. are mainly exposed to methylmercury, an organic compound, when they eat fish and shellfish that contain methylmercury. Whether an exposure to the various forms of mercury will harm a person's health depends on a number of factors. Almost all people have at least trace amounts of methylmercury in their tissues, reflecting methylmercury's widespread presence in the environment and people's exposure through the consumption of fish and shellfish. People may be exposed to mercury in any of its forms under different circumstances. The factors that determine how severe the health effects are from mercury exposure include these""   the chemical form of mercury;  the dose;  the age of the person exposed (the fetus is the most susceptible);  the duration of exposure;  the route of exposure -- inhalation, ingestion, dermal contact, etc.; and  the health of the person exposed. "
"What are the side effects, signs, and symptoms of mercury poisoning?","""For fetuses, infants, and children, the primary health effect of methylmercury is impaired neurological development. Methylmercury exposure in the womb, which can result from a mother's consumption of fish and shellfish that contain methylmercury, can adversely affect a baby's growing brain and nervous system. Impacts on cognitive thinking, memory, attention, language, and fine motor and visual spatial skills have been seen in children exposed to methylmercury in the womb. Recent human biological monitoring by the Centers for Disease Control and ""'Prevention'' in 1999 and 2000 (PDF) shows that most people have blood mercury levels below a level associated with possible health effects. ''More recent data from the CDC'' support this general finding. ''Outbreaks of methylmercury poisonings have made it clear that adults, children, and developing fetuses are at risk from ingestion exposure to methylmercury. During these poisoning outbreaks some mothers with no symptoms of nervous system damage gave birth to infants with severe disabilities, it became clear that the developing nervous system of the fetus may be more vulnerable to methylmercury than is the adult nervous system. ''For more information on fish consumption advisories across the country, visit '""EPA's fish consumption web pages""'. ''In addition to the subtle impairments noted above, symptoms of methylmercury poisoning may include;''People concerned about their exposure to methylmercury should consult their physician. ''Elemental (metallic) mercury primarily causes health effects when it is breathed as a vapor where it can be absorbed through the lungs. These exposures can occur when elemental mercury is spilled or products that contain elemental mercury break and expose mercury to the air, particularly in warm or poorly-ventilated indoor spaces. ''Symptoms include these: ''At higher exposures there may be kidney effects, respiratory failure and death. People concerned about their exposure to elemental mercury should consult their physician. ''High exposures to inorganic mercury may result in damage to the gastrointestinal tract, the nervous system, and the kidneys. Both inorganic and organic mercury compounds are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and affect other systems via this route. However, organic mercury compounds are more readily absorbed via ingestion than inorganic mercury compounds. ''Symptoms of high exposures to inorganic mercury include: ''People concerned about their exposure to inorganic mercury should consult their physician. '   impairment of the peripheral vision;  disturbances in sensations (""pins and needles"" feelings, usually in the hands, feet, and around the mouth); lack of coordination of movements;  impairment of speech, hearing, walking; and  muscle weakness.  tremors;  emotional changes (for example, mood swings, irritability, nervousness, excessive shyness);  insomnia;  neuromuscular changes (such as weakness, muscle atrophy, twitching);  headaches;  disturbances in sensations;  changes in nerve responses;  performance deficits on tests of cognitive function.  skin rashes and dermatitis;  mood swings;  memory loss;  mental disturbances; and  muscle weakness.

What about mercury in batteries?,"'Most batteries made in the U.S. do not contain added mercury. The two exceptions are ''mercuric oxide batteries'' and ''button cell batteries''. Mercuric oxide batteries are produced for specialized use in military and medical equipment where a stable current and long service life is essential. Button cell batteries are miniature batteries in the shape of a coin or button that are used to provide power for a large variety of small portable electronic devices. ''The use and disposal of mercury-added button cells are unregulated at the federal level. ''Some states are now considering whether the disposal of button cell batteries should be regulated or whether recycling should be encouraged. Because button batteries currently are not widely targeted for recycling, almost all of this mercury presumably ends up in the municipal solid waste stream where it is either incinerated or landfilled. '""For a more information on batteries, see EPA's Web page on ""'Consumer and Commercial Products''. ' They do not have to be labeled;  it is legal to dispose of them in the household trash; and  they rarely are collected for recycling in most U.S. jurisdictions. "
What about mercury in dental amalgam?,"'The silver fillings used by dentists to restore ''teeth'' are composed of a metal ""amalgam"" containing roughly 50% elemental mercury and 50% other metals (mostly silver with some tin and copper). Amalgam is one of the most commonly used tooth fillings, and is considered to be a safe, sound, and effective treatment for ''tooth decay''. Amalgam has been the most widely used tooth filling material for decades. It remains popular because it is strong, lasting and low-cost. Dental amalgams are considered medical devices and are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). ''The mercury found in amalgam fillings has raised some safety concerns over the years. Amalgam can release small amounts of mercury vapor over time, and patients can absorb these vapors by inhaling or ingesting them. ''According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is little scientific evidence that the health of the vast majority of people with dental amalgam is compromised, nor that removing amalgam fillings has a beneficial effect on health. A 2004 review of the scientific literature conducted for the U.S. Public Health Service found ""insufficient evidence of a link between dental mercury and health problems, except in rare instances of ''allergic reaction''."" ''The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) consumer update on dental amalgam advises, as a precaution, that pregnant women and persons who may have a health condition that makes them more sensitive to mercury exposure should discuss dental treatment options with their health care practitioner. FDA, which regulates the use of dental amalgam, is reviewing the scientific evidence on the safe use of amalgam.''Amalgam use is declining because the incidence of dental decay is decreasing and because improved substitute materials are now available for certain applications. If dental patients do not want to use mercury amalgam, there are several non-mercury restorative materials available. Presently, there are six types of restorative materials: ''Each type of restorative material has advantages and disadvantages. Some factors that influence the choice of restorative material used include: cost, strength, durability, location of ''cavity'', and aesthetics. ''The choice of dental treatment rests with dental professionals and their patients, so you should talk with your dentist about dental treatment options that are available. The American Dental Association provides a brochure for dental patients on the advantages and disadvantages of various types of dental fillings. ''Mercury from dental amalgam is a major source of controllable mercury released to the environment and likely will remain a significant concern into the future.''Mercury from dental amalgam is released to the environment through three primary pathways: '""The majority of dental mercury amalgam is discharged from dental offices to wastewater treatment systems.

What about mercury in fish?,"'Fish and shellfish are an important part of a healthy ''diet''. Fish and shellfish contain high-quality protein and other essential nutrients, are low in saturated fat, and contain ''omega-3 fatty acids'"". A well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fish and shellfish can contribute to heart health and children's proper growth and development. """"However, nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces of methylmercury. For most people, the risk from exposure to methylmercury by eating fish and shellfish is not a health concern. Yet some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that may harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. The risks from methlymercury in fish and shellfish depend on the amount of fish and shellfish eaten and the levels of methylmercury in the fish. Federal, state and local governments issue fish advisories when the fish are unsafe to eat.

What about mercury in fluorescent light bulbs?,"'A fluorescent light bulb (also referred to as a ""lamp"") is a ''gas''-discharge bulb that uses electricity to excite mercury vapor. The excited mercury atoms produce short-wave ultraviolet light that causes a phosphor to fluoresce, producing visible light. Mercury is an essential component of all fluorescent light bulbs, and allows these bulbs to be energy-efficient light sources. ''Tube: ''The standard straight ""linear"" tube comes in a variety of diameters and lengths. For example:''Compact fluorescent light (CFL):'' This is a short bulb made of a tube about the diameter of a pencil that has been either folded or twisted, resulting in an overall size that rivals a standard incandescent light bulb. Since the CFL fits into a standard light socket, the bulb and fixture design possibilities are vastly increased over that of a fluorescent tube. CFLs are now available in a variety of shapes, including spiral (twisted), short tube (folded over) and globe. A globe CFL is either round or A-shaped glass that contains within it a spiral or folded tube. ''EPA encourages Americans to use compact fluorescent lights in order to save energy. Switching from traditional incandescent bulbs to CFLs is an effective, simple change everyone can make right now to help use less electricity at home and prevent greenhouse gas emissions that lead to global climate change. ''Learn about CFLs'' – General information on Energy Star-qualified compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), where to use CFLs in a home, and how to choose the right type of CFL bulb. ''CFLs contain a very small amount of mercury sealed within the glass tubing. No mercury is released when the bulbs are intact (not broken) or in use, but CFLs can break and release mercury vapor if dropped or roughly handled. EPA encourages consumers to handle and use CFLs safely. Be careful when removing the bulb from its packaging, installing it, or replacing it. More information is provided in the ''Energy Star fact sheet: CFLs and Mercury'' (PDF). '""If a CFL breaks in your home, please follow EPA's recommended steps to carefully""' clean up and dispose of broken bulbs''. These recommendations will help to minimize any exposure to released mercury vapor. ''EPA encourages the ''recycling of burned out fluorescent bulbs'' rather than disposing of them in regular household trash. Recycling of burned out CFLs is one of the best ways to help prevent the release of mercury to the environment by keeping mercury out of landfills and incinerators. Recycling of these bulbs also allows the reuse of the glass, metals and other materials that make up fluorescent lights. ' The T-4 is ½ inch in diameter and often used under kitchen cabinets.  The T-8 is 1 inch in diameter and the T-12 is 1½ inches in diameter.  Variations include the ""U-tube"" bent in half to form a U-shape, and the ""circline"" tube bent into a circle.  The larger-diameter tube fluorescents are used in ceiling light fixtures. "
What about thimerosal in vaccines?,"'Some consumers are concerned about the use of thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative, in ''vaccines''.

Thermometers (Fever),"'Mercury ''fever'' thermometers are made of glass the size of a straw, with a silvery-white liquid inside, and used to be a common item in many households, schools and medical facilities. Now it is nearly impossible to buy one as digital thermometers have become the norm. There are two general types of mercury thermometers that measure body temperature: (1) oral/rectal/baby thermometers, containing about 0.61 grams of mercury; and (2) ''basal temperature'' thermometers, containing about 2.25 grams of mercury. ''The presence of a mercury thermometer itself is not a problem. However glass thermometers may break while in use, releasing harmful mercury vapor and exposing people in the immediate indoor area. Mercury thermometers are also likely to break after being discarded in regular trash, resulting in mercury releases in the landfill or trash incinerator, or during transportation to either location. It is for this reason The American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP) encourages parents to remove mercury thermometers from their homes to prevent accidental exposure and poisoning.''In order to help remove the threat of mercury fever thermometer breakage and subsequent release of mercury vapor indoors, some states and municipalities have passed laws or ordinances prohibiting the manufacture, sale and/or distribution of these thermometers. ''As of October 2, 2008, thirteen states have laws that limit the manufacture, sale and/or distribution of mercury fever thermometers:'' ''The ''Health Care Without Harm Web site'' presents information on specific state laws and municipal ordinances. ''A variety of accurate and reliable mercury-free fever thermometers are available at your local pharmacy. Alternatives most comparable in cost and use to the mercury fever thermometer include battery and solar powered digital thermometers. These can all be used orally, rectally, or in the armpit. You should choose a thermometer that is easy to use and read. ''If choosing a battery powered digital thermometer, choose one that contains a replaceable battery; some are not replaceable. The battery is a button cell battery and may contain a small amount of mercury, so it should be recycled through a local battery collection program or ''household hazardous waste collection center''. Consult your local or state collection program regarding where batteries should be taken. ''A broken mercury thermometer is a serious health threat. If mercury spills out of a broken thermometer and is not cleaned up, it will evaporate into invisible vapor, potentially reaching dangerous levels in indoor air. If a thermometer breaks in your home, please follow '""EPA's recommended cleanup steps""' to carefully clean up and dispose of the broken glass and silver mercury beads. These recommendations will help minimize any exposure to released mercury vapor.''EPA encourages the recycling of mercury fever thermometers rather than disposing of them in regular household trash. Recycling is one of the best ways to help prevent the release of mercury to the environment by keeping mercury out of landfills and trash incinerators.

What is Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)?,"'MERS-CoV is a coronavirus that can cause severe acute ''respiratory infection'' in humans. Confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have originated in the Arabian Peninsula and surrounding areas.''In December 2019, medical professionals noted yet another type of coronavirus outbreak. The new virus, ''Wuhan virus'' (also termed ''2019-nCoV''), is an RNA virus related to both MERS and SARS coronaviruses. It likely originated in infected animals marketed in an open-air food market in Wuhan, China. The virus, like MERS, may cause moderate to severe respiratory problems in individuals and appears to spread from person to person. The majority of patients infected with the ''Wuhan virus'' need hospitalization. In 1 month, the virus spread to at least 6 countries, including the U.S.' "
What causes MERS? How is MERS transmitted?,"'MERS is caused by a virus referred to as ""MERS-CoV"" from the coronavirus genus; MERS-CoV means Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The genus coronavirus includes ''viruses'' that infect animals, cause the ''common cold'' in humans, and caused the 2003 SARS outbreak in China. However, the MERS-CoV virus is different than other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, and had never been identified before 2012. MERS-CoV has been detected in camels in several countries but not in other livestock. It has been detected in camel meat, organs, milk and urine; infected camels may not be observably ill.''MERS-CoV is spread from person to person through respiratory droplet secretions. MERS has also infected people caring for a sick (MERS-CoV-infected) individual. Contact with infected body fluids, respiratory secretions, raw or undercooked camel meat, and unpasteurized dairy products of camels may be other sources of transmission to humans.'""MERS-CoV infection should be suspected in travelers who've recently come from the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries with a compatible illness occurring within 10 days of traveling.""'Health-care workers or contacts of a MERS-infected individual are at risk, as are veterinary, farm, dairy, market, race track, and slaughterhouse workers who handle camels.' "
Is MERS-CoV contagious?,"'MERS is ''contagious'' (infectious) from person to person by respiratory droplets, either by ''breathing'' airborne droplets, or contact of respiratory secretions with moist membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes. It is ''contagious'' from camel to human via respiratory droplets as well as meat, milk, and urine of an infected animal, even though the animal may not appear sick.' "
What is the incubation period of a MERS-CoV infection?,"'The incubation period (the time between infection and start of symptoms) is about five days, but it can occasionally be up range from two to 14 days.' "
What is the contagious period for a MERS-CoV infection?,'The contagious period (the time that a sick animal or human is infectious) for MERS-CoV is not known but may last as long as virus is being shed.' 
What are risk factors for MERS-CoV infection?,"'MERS-CoV can infect a person regardless of his/her health status or age group. Recent travelers from the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries who develop severe acute respiratory infection should be tested for MERS-CoV. Elderly people and those with underlying medical conditions such as ''diabetes'', ''heart disease'', or ''liver disease'"" are at risk of severe infection. Close association with any person infected with MERS-CoV, as in caregivers, health-care workers, or household contacts, is a major risk factor. Contact with camel body fluids, respiratory secretions, raw or undercooked meat, and unpasteurized dairy products likely also poses a major risk of transmission to humans in the Arabian Peninsula and surrounding countries. Thus, those who work in these areas and handle live camels, or camel's meat or milk are at risk, including veterinarians and those who work at markets or race tracks, and those who slaughter, butcher, milk, and cook raw camel products. Cooked meat and pasteurized milk is safe to handle and consume. Not all camels may transmit the disease; Bactrian (Mongolian) camel herds currently show no infections with MERS, but researchers are not sure these camels have ever been exposed to the virus."" "
What are MERS symptoms and signs?,"'Initially, the illness resembles ''influenza'' with ''fever'' and a mild ''cough''. The ''breathing'' disorder often progresses to severe ''shortness of breath'' (dyspnea) and inability to maintain oxygenation (''hypoxia''). Progression may be rapid, or it may take several days. Severely affected people develop a potentially fatal form of respiratory failure, known as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARD or ''ARDS''). In addition to attacking the alveoli in the ''lungs'', the virus also infects other organs in the body, causing ''kidney failure'', inflammation of the ''heart'' sac (''pericarditis''), or severe systemic bleeding from disruption of the clotting system (''disseminated intravascular coagulation''). People with compromised immune systems such as severe ''rheumatoid arthritis'' or organ transplantation may not experience respiratory symptoms but can have ''fever'' or ''diarrhea''.' "
What types of specialists treat MERS-CoV infection?,"'Most people with SARS would see a primary-care provider or an emergency-medicine doctor as illness rapidly progressed. Depending on the stage of illness, they would be admitted to a hospital as oxygen levels decreased. In the hospital, a person with SARS would likely be managed by a hospitalist or critical-care doctor, with consultations to an infectious-disease doctor and lung doctor (''pulmonologist'').' "
How do health-care professionals diagnose a MERS-CoV infection?,"'MERS-CoV is detected using a reverse transcriptase ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR'') test. On June 5, 2013, the FDA issued an emergency-use authorization (EUA) for the CDC Novel Coronavirus 2012 Real-Time RT-''PCR'' Assay. This test detects Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), formerly known as novel coronavirus 2012 or NCV-2012, in patients with signs and symptoms of MERS and appropriate risk factors. This assay is distributed by the CDC to qualified laboratories. The PCR is performed on a sample of respiratory secretions or blood.'""When the patient's history makes the MERS diagnosis likely, these tests are done with the help of state and local public-health authorities, the CDC, and infectious disease subspecialists. The CDC confirms all positive tests.""'ELISA'', or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and IFA, or immunofluorescence assay, are tests for antibody to MERS-CoV; they are used for research purposes rather than patient care.''Other tests may be abnormal, but they are not specific for SARS or MERS. The ''chest X-ray'' shows ''pneumonia'', which may look patchy at first. Typically, infiltrates may look like ""ground glass"" on ''CT scans'' but may progress to a ""white out"" appearance. Usually, lymphocyte and platelet counts are decreased while ''creatinine'' phosphokinase (CPK) and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels may be increased.''MERS should be suspected in people with the appropriate symptoms who work with MERS-CoV in a laboratory, who are healthcare workers, or potential contacts of a MERS-infected person. It is extremely unlikely that a patient in the U.S. will have MERS without having traveled to the Middle East or caring for an infected returning ''traveler''. In 2014, MERS-CoV infections were diagnosed in two people who had no ties to each other. Both individuals were traveling healthcare workers living and working in Saudi Arabia. None of the staff caring for these individuals nor household contacts became infected with MERS-CoV. In 2016, Saudi Arabia reported another outbreak of the disease.' "
What is the treatment for MERS-CoV?,"""Because MERS-CoV is caused by a similar virus as SARS, the management of MERS-CoV has been extrapolated from experience with the 2002 SARS outbreak and some limited experimental data. Like SARS, patients with MERS-CoV often require oxygen supplementation, and severe cases require mechanical ventilation and intensive-care-unit support. No medication has been proven to treat MERS-CoV, and treatment is based upon the patient's medical condition. Several medications have been tried in both SARS and MERS-CoV without conclusive benefits, and further research is to be done. Management of the individual with MERS is aided by infectious disease, pulmonary, and critical-care specialists."" "
What is the prognosis of MERS-CoV? What are complications of MERS-CoV?,"'MERS is associated with a rapidly progressive severe respiratory illness, and mortality compared to the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2003 is very high. Since 2012, the MERS outbreak in Saudi Arabia has slowly continued with a total of 933 individuals diagnosed with 401 deaths as of March 2015, for a mortality rate of about 50%. ''Pneumonia'' and ''kidney failure'' are complications of MERS-CoV.' "
Is it possible to prevent MERS?,"'Fortunately, MERS-CoV does not appear to spread as easily or rapidly from person to person as the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2003. Travelers to the Arabian Peninsula and surrounding countries, and their close contacts, may protect themselves by taking simple measures that help to prevent the spread of germs. Frequent hand hygiene using soap and water, or an ''alcohol'""-based hand sanitizer, avoidance of close contact with sick people, and avoidance of touching one's eyes, nose, and mouth can prevent the spread of ""'viruses''. Caregivers of patients who are not hospitalized should perform frequent hand hygiene as stated above and wear a face mask for direct care until the patient has recovered.''In the Arabian Peninsula and surrounding countries where MERS-CoV has been found, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends precautions in handling live camels or their raw meat and dairy products. Anyone who does so, should frequently wash hands and consider using respiratory protection, as well as barriers to protect skin and clothing. Clothing worn during handling of camels or their products should be kept away from household contacts and washed daily. All products intended for human consumption should be cooked thoroughly or pasteurized.''In the health-care setting, a suspected case of SARS is placed in airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). This is a patient care room used to isolate people with suspected or confirmed airborne infectious diseases. The air is under negative pressure, meaning that contaminated air is continually sucked into the room instead of letting it leak out into the hospital environment. This air is exhausted outside, or it circulates back into the room after passing through a high-efficiency particulate air (''HEPA'"") filter to decontaminate it. If an AIIR not available, the patient must wear a face mask and is isolated in a single-patient room with the door closed. The number of staff assigned and the patient's movements outside of the room must be minimized. Before entering the isolation room, health-care workers caring for the patient must wear a gown, gloves, eye shield, and mask or a portable air purifier that filters out small infectious particles (N95 mask). Before leaving the room, any disposable gear such as gowns, gloves, and mask must be discarded. Hands must be cleansed with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after leaving the room and before attending to another patient.""'Local public-health authorities should be consulted promptly when a MERS-CoV diagnosis is considered. Preventing an outbreak requires identification of the first infected patients as soon as possible before the infection spreads further. Those who have been exposed to an infected person should be carefully monitored for ''fever'' or respiratory symptoms. Exposure is defined as living with or caring for an infected person, being within 3 ''feet'' of the infected person, and exposure to bodily fluids or direct physical contact with an infected person. The Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' does not mandate quarantine measures for exposed individuals who are otherwise healthy.''Public-health authorities have taken steps to assure preparedness. In the U.S., the CDC continues to monitor the international situation and issues travel advisories for U.S. travelers to affected areas. The CDC may detain individuals arriving in the U.S. or traveling between states who are believed to be infected with a disease subject to quarantine, including MERS, as of July 31, 2014, per amended U.S. Executive Order 13295.' "
Is there a vaccine for MERS-CoV?,'No ''vaccine'' is commercially available at the time of writing.' 
Where can people get more information about MERS-CoV?,'Information on MERS-CoV may be obtained from the CDC at ''http://www.cdc.gov/''coronavirus/mers/faq.html'' or the World Health Organization at ''http://www.who.int/csr/disease/''coronavirus_infections/en/index.html''.' 
What is mesothelioma?,"'Mesothelioma is a rare form of ''cancer'' (''malignancy'') that most frequently arises from the cells lining the sacs of the chest (the pleura) or the abdomen (the peritoneum). Pleural mesothelioma is the most common form, often becoming apparent with symptoms in the chest area such as ''chest pain'', ''cough'', and/or ''shortness of breath''. Shortness of breath often occurs due to a large ''pleural effusion'' (fluid in the thoracic ''cavity''). Peritoneal mesothelioma is much less common. This can affect the organs in the abdomen, and its symptoms are related to this area of the body, that is, ''abdominal swelling'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and bowel obstruction. The rarest form of mesothelioma is ''pericardial'' mesothelioma, which involves the sac surrounding the ''heart''.''There are two major cell types of mesothelioma, epithelial and sarcomatoid. Sometimes both of these cell types can be present, also referred to as biphasic. The sarcomatoid type is rarer and occurs in only about 15% of cases; it portends a poorer prognosis. In very rare cases, mesothelioma can originate from benign, non-''malignant'' cells. Surgery cures this so-called benign mesothelioma.' "
What are mesothelioma symptoms?,"'Most people present with complaints of shortness of breath. They also can have complaints of ''chest pain'' and ''cough''. Patients may also be asymptomatic, with the disease discovered by physical exam or an abnormal ''chest X-ray''.''As the disease progresses, shortness of breath increases, and ''weight loss'', ''decreased appetite'', and ''night sweats'' can develop. Local invasion by the ''tumor'' can result in changing of voice, loss of function of the ''diaphragm'', and symptoms specific to the area and involvement of adjacent structures.'  "
What causes mesothelioma?,"'Most people with malignant mesothelioma have worked on jobs where they breathed asbestos. Usually, this involves men over 40 years of age. Others have been exposed to asbestos in a household environment, often without knowing it. The number of new cases of mesothelioma has been relatively stable since 1983, the same time that the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) instituted restrictions on asbestos. In Europe, the number of new cases of mesothelioma continues to rise.' "
How much asbestos exposure does it take to get mesothelioma?,"'An exposure of as little as one or two months can result in mesothelioma 30 or 40 years later and in some cases, as much as 70 years later.'  "
How long does it take after asbestos exposure for mesothelioma to show up?,"""People exposed in the 1940s, '50s, '60s, and '70s are now being diagnosed with mesothelioma because of the long latency period of asbestos disease."" "
How do health care professionals diagnose mesothelioma?,"'Pathological examination from a biopsy diagnoses mesothelioma. A health care professional removes tissue. Then a pathologist places it under a microscope and makes a definitive diagnosis and issues a pathology report. This is the end of a process that usually begins with symptoms that send most people to the doctor: a fluid buildup around the ''lungs'' (pleural effusions), shortness of breath, ''pain in the chest'', or ''pain'' or swelling in the abdomen. The doctor may order an X-ray or ''CT scan'' of the chest or abdomen. If further examination is warranted, the following tests may be done:'  Thoracentesis: This is a relatively simple procedure involving numbing the chest wall and removing some fluid for diagnosis and /or relief of symptoms from the space occupying fluid in the chest cavity. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to obtain an absolute diagnosis in differentiating adenocarcinoma of the lung, severe cellular reaction to inflammation, and mesothelium (the cells that line the chest cavity) . More invasive techniques are often required to confirm the diagnosis and develop an effective treatment strategy. Thoracoscopy: For pleural mesothelioma, the doctor may look inside the chest cavity with a special instrument called a thoracoscope. A doctor makes a cut through the chest wall and puts a thoracoscope into the chest between two ribs. Doctors perform this test on patients using an anesthetic in a hospital setting. If fluid has collected in your chest, your doctor may drain the fluid out of your body by putting a needle into your chest and using gentle suction to remove the fluid (a procedure called thoracentesis). Peritoneoscopy: For peritoneal mesothelioma, the doctor may also look inside the abdomen with a special tool called a peritoneoscope. A doctor places a peritoneoscope into an opening made in the abdomen. Physicians perform this test on a patient under an anesthetic in a hospital setting. If fluid has collected in your abdomen, your doctor may drain the fluid out of your body by putting a needle into your abdomen and using gentle suction to remove the fluid (a process called paracentesis). Biopsy: If abnormal tissue is found, the doctor will need to cutout a small piece and have it looked at under a microscope. Doctors do this during the thoracoscopy or peritoneoscopy, but can be done during surgery. Unfortunately, in some cases, tumor cells can grow along the tract where the biopsy is taken, although this remains unproven. Radiation to the area minimizes this risk."
What is the prognosis for mesothelioma?,"'Like most ''cancers'', the prognosis for this disease often depends on how early it is diagnosed and how aggressively it is treated. Unfortunately, oftentimes health care professionals find mesothelioma at a stage in which a cure is unobtainable. Many will succumb to the disease within one year of diagnosis.''Treatment options are determined by the stage of mesothelioma (the extent to which the tumor has spread in the body). There are three staging systems currently in use, and each one measures somewhat different variables.''The oldest staging system and the one most often used is the Butchart system, based mainly on the extent of ''primary tumor'' mass and divides mesotheliomas into four stages.''The more recent TNM system considers variables of tumor in mass and spread, ''lymph node'' involvement, and metastasis.''TNM system: variables of T (tumor), N (lymph nodes), and M (metastasis)''The Brigham system is the latest system and stages mesothelioma according to resectability (the ability to remove the tumor surgically) and lymph node involvement.' Stage I: Mesothelioma is present in the right or left pleura and may involve the diaphragm on the same side. Stage II: Mesothelioma invades the chest wall or involves the esophagus, heart, or pleura on both sides. Lymph nodes in the chest may also be involved. Stage III: Mesothelioma has penetrated through the diaphragm into the lining of the abdominal cavity or peritoneum. Lymph nodes beyond those in the chest may also be involved. Stage IV: There is evidence of metastasis or spread through the bloodstream to other organs. Stage I: Mesothelioma involves right or left pleura and may have spread to the lung, pericardium, or diaphragm on the same side. Lymph nodes are not involved. Stage II: Mesothelioma has spread from the pleura on one side to nearby lymph nodes next to the lung on the same side. It may also have spread into the lung, pericardium, or diaphragm on the same side. Stage III: Mesothelioma is now in the chest wall, muscle, ribs, heart, esophagus, or other organs in the chest on the same side with or without spread to lymph nodes on the same side as the primary tumor. Stage IV: Mesothelioma has spread into the lymph nodes in the chest on the side opposite the primary tumor, extended to the pleura or lung on the opposite side, or directly extended into organs in the abdominal cavity or neck. Any distant metastases is included in this stage. Stage I: resectable mesothelioma and no lymph node involvement Stage II: resectable mesothelioma but with lymph node involvement Stage III: unresectable mesothelioma extending into chest wall, heart, or through diaphragm, peritoneum; with or without extrathoracic lymph-node involvement Stage IV: distant metastatic disease"
What is the treatment for mesothelioma?,"'There are three traditional kinds of treatment for patients with malignant mesothelioma. Often physicians combine two or more of these in the course of treatment:''Surgery: There are several types of surgery used in treating mesothelioma.''Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation may come from a machine outside the body (external radiation therapy) or from putting materials that produce radiation (radioisotopes) through thin ''plastic'' tubes in the area where the cancer cells are (internal radiation therapy).''If fluid has collected in the chest or abdomen, your doctor may drain the fluid out of your body by putting in a needle into the chest or abdomen and using gentle suction to remove the fluid. If a doctor removes fluid from the chest, this is called ''thoracentesis''. If a physician removes fluid from the abdomen, this is called ''paracentesis''. Your doctor may also put drugs through a tube into the chest to prevent more fluid from accumulating.''Health care professionals administer adjuvant radiation in a manner to avoid exposure of the opposite lung to radiation and its potential side effects.''Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer cells. Health care professionals administer chemotherapy by pill, or it may be put into the body by a needle in the vein or muscle. Often, a platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) drug is given along with a second agent, pemetrexed. The side effects can be quite toxic, therefore they are used in people who are physically well enough to tolerate these side effects.''Chemotherapeutic agents can be administered either systemically (through the bloodstream) or intrapleurally (in the pleural cavity). When it is administered intrapleurally, the treatment is localized at the site of the tumor. These drugs are generally very toxic and you should discuss their use very carefully with your physician.'   surgery (taking out the cancer), radiation therapy (using high-dose X-rays or other high-energy rays to kill cancer cells), and chemotherapy (using drugs to fight the cancer). A pleurectomy is the removal of part of the chest or abdomen lining and some of the tissue around it. Depending on how far the cancer has spread, physicians may remove a lung in an operation called a pneumonectomy. In an extrapleural pneumonectomy, a doctor removes the lung along with the lining and diaphragm (the muscle that helps you breathe) on the affected side. In this surgery, the lining around the heart is also removed. Sometimes a physician performs a pleurectomy/decortication. In this surgery, a doctor removes the lining of the lung along with as much of the tumor as possible. Determining appropriate candidates for surgery can be difficult. Staging of a cancer is the process that determines how extensive the cancer is, or how far it has grown and spread. Often, staging procedures such as mediastinoscopy (examining the central part of the chest through a tube) or peritoneoscopy (examining the inside of the abdominal cavity with a tube) are necessary to determine the extent of disease. Clinical staging often underestimates true pathological staging (the amount of tumor found when biopsied). CT scanning, PET/CT, and or MRI can help in the staging process. In choosing candidates for surgery, the individual's underlying physical condition matters. Diseases of other organ systems have a negative impact on survival. The more localized the disease (low stage) the better the prognosis. The cell type also affects prognosis; tumors with an epithelioid cell types have better outcomes."
Is there any promising research or are there promising drugs for mesothelioma?,"'Medical researchers are testing new approaches to treat malignant mesothelioma. They often combine traditional treatments or include something entirely new. They include:''Research is being conducted at various cancer centers all over the United States.''A recent study involving L-NDDP produced two cases of remission in mesothelioma patients. Another study found that a drug known as lovastatin might hold promise for mesothelioma patients.''To learn more about mesothelioma clinical studies and journal medical journal articles, visit the Mesothelioma Web (''http://www.mesotheliomaweb.org'').' L-NDDP (Platar): Intrapleural administration of this platinum product is designed to overcome the toxicity and drug resistance currently limiting the usefulness of platinum drugs like Cisplatin. NOTE: A recent trial produced remission in two patients. Endostatin works with angiostatin in destroying a tumors' ability to grow blood vessels without harming normal cells. Lovastatin is a cholesterol drug shown in a recent study to inhibit mesothelioma cancer cell growth. Intrapleural interferon gamma is the direct administration of the anti-cancer drug interferon gamma. Photodynamic therapy kills cancer cells using the energy of light. Immunotherapy treats cancer by helping the immune system fight the disease. Gene therapy treats cancer by correcting the genetic deficits that allow tumors to develop. A September 1999 study found that interferon interleukin prevented the growth of mesothelioma cells in mice. HIPEC (hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy) and HITHOC (hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy perfusion) are additional techniques under investigation. Theoretically, health care professionals can administer higher-dose chemotherapy to a more localized environment with these procedures. The hope is that this will increase the amount of chemotherapy where needed, with less systemic damage and fewer side effects."
"What other kinds of information is available for 
people with mesothelioma?","'There are numerous cancer web sites, some specific to mesothelioma. Because they are often difficult to locate, we have listed some relevant medical web sites that have information about mesothelioma.''American Institute for Cancer Research''(http://www.aicr.org)''American Thoracic Society''(http://www.thoracic.org/)''Canadian Cancer Society''(http://www.bc.cancer.ca)'' Mesothelioma Web''(http://www.mesotheliomaweb.org)' "
What is metabolic syndrome?,"'Metabolic syndrome'' is a cluster of metabolic risk factors that come together in a single individual. These metabolic factors include ''insulin resistance'', ''hypertension'' (''high blood pressure''), ''cholesterol'' abnormalities, and an increased risk for blood clotting. Affected individuals are most often ''overweight'' or ''obese''. An association between certain metabolic disorders and ''cardiovascular disease'' has been known since the 1940s.''Metabolic syndrome is considered to be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and ''type 2 diabetes''. ''Insulin'' resistance refers to the diminished ability of cells to respond to the action of insulin in promoting the transport of the ''sugar'' glucose, from blood into muscles and other tissues. ''Type 2 diabetes'' is caused by insulin resistance.''Metabolic syndrome is also known as syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome, or dysmetabolic syndrome.' "
How is metabolic syndrome defined?,"'Based on the guidelines from the National ''Heart'', Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the American Heart Association (AHA), any three of the following traits in the same individual meet the criteria for the metabolic syndrome: ' Abdominal obesity: a waist circumference of 102 cm (40 in) or more in men and 88 cm (35 inches) or more in women. For Asian Americans, the cutoff values are ≥90 cm (35 in) in men or ≥80 cm (32 in) in women 
	Serum triglycerides 150 mg/dl or above.  HDL cholesterol 40mg/dl or lower in men and 50mg/dl or lower in women.
	 Blood pressure of 130/85 or more.  Fasting blood glucose of 100 mg/dl or above. "
How common is metabolic syndrome?,"'Metabolic syndrome is quite common. Approximately 32% of the population in the U.S. has metabolic syndrome, and about 85% of those with ''type 2 diabetes'' have metabolic syndrome. Around 25% of adults in Europe and Latin America are estimated to have the condition, and rates are rising in developing East Asian countries. Within the US, Mexican Americans have the highest prevalence of metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome increases with age, and about 40% of people over 60 are affected. ' "
"What causes, and what are the risk factors of metabolic syndrome?","'As is true with many medical conditions, genetics and the environment both play important roles in the development of the metabolic syndrome.''Genetic factors influence each individual component of the syndrome, and the syndrome itself. A family history that includes type 2 ''diabetes'', ''hypertension'', and early ''heart disease'' greatly increases the chance that an individual will develop the metabolic syndrome.''Environmental issues such as low activity level, sedentary lifestyle, and progressive ''weight gain'' also contribute significantly to the risk of developing the metabolic syndrome.''Metabolic syndrome is present in about 9% of people with normal body weight, 22% of those who are overweight and 60% of those considered obese. Adults who continue to gain five or more pounds per year raise their risk of developing metabolic syndrome by up to 45%.''While obesity itself is likely the greatest risk factor, others factors of concern include:' Post-menopausal women Smoking Eating an excessively high carbohydrate diet Sedentary lifestyle"
What are the symptoms of metabolic syndrome?,"'\tMetabolic syndrome is a condition that in general, has no symptoms. If a person has risk factors for metabolic syndrome (particularly a large waist circumference), your doctor can help evaluate your risk.'  "
Why should I know about metabolic syndrome?,"'Metabolic syndrome is worth caring about because it is significant risk factor for the development of both type 2 ''diabetes'' and ''heart disease'', two of the most common and important chronic diseases today.' Metabolic syndrome is associated with fat accumulation in the liver (fatty liver), resulting in inflammation and the potential for cirrhosis. The kidneys can also be affected, as there is an association with microalbuminuria -- the leaking of protein into the urine, a subtle but clear indication of kidney damage. Other problems associated with metabolic syndrome include obstructive sleep apnea, polycystic ovary syndrome, increased risk of dementia with aging, and cognitive decline in the elderly."
What is the treatment for metabolic syndrome?,"'The major goals are to treat both the underlying cause of the syndrome, to prevent the development of type 2 ''diabetes'', and also to treat the cardiovascular risk factors if they persist. As has been discussed, a majority of people with metabolic syndrome are overweight and live a sedentary lifestyle. ''Lifestyle modification is the preferred treatment of metabolic syndrome. Weight reduction usually requires a specifically tailored multifaceted program that includes ''diet'' and ''exercise''. ''Smoking cessation'' is an important component of treatment, and sometimes medications may be useful. '  "
Diet and metabolic syndrome,"'A detailed discussion of diet therapies, pros and cons of various diets etc. is beyond the scope of this article. However, there is now a trend toward the use of a ''Mediterranean diet'' -- one that is rich in ""good"" ''fats'' (olive oil) and contains a reasonable amount of carbohydrates and proteins (such as from fish and chicken).''The ''Mediterranean diet'' is palatable and easily sustained. In addition, recent studies have shown that when compared to a low fat diet, people on the Mediterranean diet have a greater decrease in body weight, and also had greater improvements in blood pressure, ''cholesterol levels'', and other markers of ''heart disease'' -- all of which are important in evaluating and treating metabolic syndrome.''Other nutritional plans that may be recommended for people with metabolic syndrome include the American Dietary Association (ADA) diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop ''Hypertension'' (DASH) diet.'  "
Exercise and metabolic syndrome,"'A sustainable ''exercise'' program, for example 30 minutes five days a week is reasonable to start, providing there is no medical contraindication. (If you have any special concerns in this regard, check with your doctor first.) There is a beneficial effect of exercise on blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and insulin sensitivity, regardless of whether ''weight loss'' is achieved or not. Thus, exercise in itself is a helpful tool in treating metabolic syndrome. ' "
Cosmetic surgery to remove fat,"'Some people may ask: Why not just have ''liposuction'' of the abdomen and remove the large amount of\xa0''abdominal fat''\xa0that\xa0is a big part of the problem? Data thus far shows no benefit in liposuction on insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, or cholesterol. As the saying goes, ""If it\'s too good to be true, it probably is."" Diet and exercise are still the preferred primary treatment of metabolic syndrome.' "
What if lifestyle changes are not enough to treat metabolic syndrome?,"'What if changes in lifestyle do not do the trick, what then? ''Drugs'' to control cholesterol levels, ''lipids'', and ''high blood pressure'' may be considered. ''If someone has already had a ''heart attack'', their LDL (""bad"") cholesterol should be reduced below 70mg/dl. A person who has diabetes has a heart attack risk equivalent to that of someone who has already one and so should be treated in the same way. If you have metabolic syndrome, a detailed discussion about ''lipid'' therapy is needed between you and your doctor, as each individual is unique. ''Blood pressure goals are generally set lower than 130/80. Some blood pressure medications offer more benefits than simply ''lowering blood pressure''. For example, a class of blood pressure drugs called ''ACE inhibitors'' has been found to also reduce the levels of insulin resistance and actually deter the development of type 2 diabetes. This is an important consideration when discussing the choice blood pressure drugs in the metabolic syndrome. ''The discovery that a drug is prescribed for one condition, and has other beneficial effects is not new. Drugs used to treat ''high blood sugar'' and insulin resistance may have beneficial effects on blood pressure and cholesterol profiles. ''Metformin'' (''Glucophage''), usually used to treat type 2 diabetes, also has been found to help prevent the onset of diabetes in people with metabolic syndrome. However, there are currently no established guidelines on treating metabolic syndrome patients with metformin if they do not have overt diabetes. ' "
Metabolic Syndrome Summary,"'Choosing healthier lifestyles such as exercising; losing weight; lowering blood pressure, cholesterol and ''triglyceride levels'"" may decrease a person's chance of developing metabolic syndrome.""'The final take home message is make healthy lifestyle changes. Some suggestions for doing this are:''It all adds up. Preventing metabolic syndrome really means having a healthy lifestyle.' Invite a buddy to exercise with you. Take a walk during your work break, even if it is just around the building. Increase consumption of fruits and vegetables and decrease consumption of fats. Grocery shop at healthy food stores. Evaluate what you feed your kids. Urge children to go outside and play."
"What is methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type?","'Beta-globin type methemoglobinemia is an inherited blood disorder. It disrupts the function of ''hemoglobin'', the molecule in ''red blood cells'' that delivers oxygen to cells throughout the body. Methemoglobinemia is characterized by increased levels of an atypical form of hemoglobin that is unable to deliver oxygen efficiently.''In most individuals with beta-globin type methemoglobinemia, the only symptom is cyanosis, which is a bluish appearance of the skin, mucous membranes, or the area underneath the fingernails due to a lack of oxygen in the blood. Symptoms may appear as early as age 3 to 4 months. Methemoglobinemia symptoms do not improve when affected individuals are given additional oxygen, because oxygen cannot bind effectively to the abnormal hemoglobin.' "
"How common is methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type?",'The incidence of beta-globin type methemoglobinemia is unknown.' 
"What genes are related to methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type?","'Mutations in the HBB gene cause methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type.''Hemoglobin consists of four protein subunits and four iron-containing molecules called heme. Heme molecules are necessary for red blood cells to pick up oxygen in the ''lungs'' and release oxygen to other cells in the body. Hemoglobin typically has two protein subunits call alpha-globin and two protein subunits called beta-globin. The HBB gene provides instructions for making beta-globin. Mutations in specific regions of the HBB gene lead to an atypical version of beta-globin known as hemoglobin M. Hemoglobin M interacts abnormally with heme molecules, which impairs the uptake of oxygen by red blood cells. As a result, a reduced amount of oxygen is delivered to cells throughout the body.''Other types of methemoglobinemia can be caused by abnormal alpha-globin, a shortage of a particular enzyme called NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, or unusual reactions to certain ''drugs'' or chemicals.' "
"How do people inherit methemoglobinemia, beta-globin type?","'This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.' "

What should I know about myasthenia gravis?*,"'*This ''myasthenia gravis'' section written by Charles Patrick Davis, MD, PhD''What is the medical definition of myasthenia gravis?''What symptoms would you expect from myasthenia gravis?''What is the cause of myasthenia gravis?''How do you test for\xa0myasthenia gravis?''Is myasthenia gravis life threatening?' Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by varying degrees of weakness of the skeletal (voluntary) muscles of the body. The thymus may give incorrect instructions to developing immune cells, ultimately resulting in autoimmunity and the production of the acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Symptoms and signs of myasthenia gravis may include:Problems with vision, called ocular myasthenia gravis and include:Eye muscle weaknessEyelid drooping (ptosis)Blurry or double vision (diplopia)Problems walkingChanges in facial expressionsProblems swallowingShortness of breathProblems speakingWeakness in the arms, hands, fingers, legs, and neck Problems with vision, called ocular myasthenia gravis and include:Eye muscle weaknessEyelid drooping (ptosis)Blurry or double vision (diplopia) Eye muscle weakness Eyelid drooping (ptosis) Blurry or double vision (diplopia) Problems walking Changes in facial expressions Problems swallowing Shortness of breath Problems speaking Weakness in the arms, hands, fingers, legs, and neck Myasthenia gravis is caused by a defect in the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles. Myasthenia gravis is not directly inherited nor is it contagious. Commonly, the disease affects adult women (under 40) and older men (over 60), but it can occur at any age. Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis often is delayed because muscle weakness is a common symptom other diseases and conditions and may slowly develop. Tests to diagnose myasthenia gravis is diagnosed with tests that help confirm the diagnosis include:Detecting the presence of immune molecules or acetylcholine receptor antibodiesEdrophonium testElectromyography Detecting the presence of immune molecules or acetylcholine receptor antibodies Edrophonium test Electromyography Myasthenia gravis is treated with medications, for example:The drug Soliris is approved for adult patients with generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) who are anti-AchR antibody-positive.Anticholinesterase agents (for example, neotigmine)PlasmapheresisVarious immunosuppressive drugsSurgical treatment may include removal of the thymus. The drug Soliris is approved for adult patients with generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) who are anti-AchR antibody-positive. Anticholinesterase agents (for example, neotigmine) Plasmapheresis Various immunosuppressive drugs Surgical treatment may include removal of the thymus. A myasthenic crisis occurs when the muscles that control breathing weaken so much that you need emergency ventilation assistance to help breath. The disease prognosis and life expectancy is highly variable. Some people have complete remission (about 50% with thymus surgery) others have relatively normal lives with continued treatment, and others have a poor prognosis as the disease advances. Research is ongoing for myasthenia gravis. New treatment protocols and immunosuppressive drugs are being tried, and therapeutic methods are likely to improve in the future."
What is myasthenia gravis?,"'Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by symptoms and signs of various degrees of weakness of the skeletal (voluntary) muscles of the body. The name myasthenia gravis is Latin and Greek in origin, which literally means ""grave muscle weakness."" With current therapies, most people with myasthenia gravis are not as ""grave"" as the name implies. Most people with myasthenia gravis have a normal life expectancy.''The hallmark symptom of myasthenia gravis is muscle weakness that increases during periods of activity and improves after periods of rest. Certain muscles such as those that control eye and eyelid movement, facial expression, chewing, talking, and swallowing often are, but not always, involved in the disorder. Muscles that control breathing and neck and limb movements may be affected.'""The thymus gland, which lies in the chest area beneath the breastbone, plays an important role in the development of the immune system in early life. Its cells form a part of the body's normal immune system. The gland is somewhat large in infants, grows gradually until ""'puberty'', and then gets smaller and is replaced by fat with age. In adults with myasthenia gravis, the thymus gland remains large and is abnormal. It contains certain clusters of immune cells indicative of lymphoid hyperplasia is a condition which usually is found only in the spleen and ''lymph nodes'' during an active immune response. Some people with the condition develop thymomas (tumors of the thymus gland). Thymomas are generally benign, but they can become ''malignant''\xa0(cancerous).''The relationship between the thymus gland and myasthenia gravis is not yet fully understood. Scientists believe the thymus gland may give incorrect instructions to developing immune cells, ultimately resulting in autoimmunity and the production of the acetylcholine receptor antibodies, thereby setting the stage for the attack on neuromuscular transmission.'

What signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis?,"'Although myasthenia gravis may affect any:''The onset of the myasthenia gravis may be sudden so often signs and symptoms are not immediately noticed.''The first symptoms of myasthenia gravis in most people with the disease is weakness of the eye muscles while others may have signs and symptoms of swallowing problems and slurred speech.''The degree of muscle weakness involved in myasthenia gravis varies greatly among individuals, ranging from a localized form limited to eye muscles (ocular myasthenia), to a severe or generalized form in which many muscles -- sometimes including those that control breathing -- are affected.''Myasthenia gravis symptoms'', which vary in type and severity, may include:' Voluntary muscle. Muscles that control eye and eyelid movement Facial expressions. Swallowing problems are common. One or both eyelids drooping (ptosis) Blurred or double vision (diplopia) due to weakness of the muscles that control eye movements Instablility when walking Changes in facial expressions Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) Shortness of breath Impaired speech (dysarthria) Weakness in the arms, hands, fingers, legs, and neck"
What is myasthenic crisis? What are the symptoms and signs?

In people whose respiratory muscles are weak, crises, which generally requires immediate medical treatment. Myasthenic crises may be triggered by an:' Infection Fever Adverse reaction to a medication(s)"
Who gets myasthenia gravis? Is it inherited? Is it contagious?," Myasthenia gravis occurs in all ethnic groups and both females and males. Commonly, the disease occurs in young adult women (under 40) and older men (over 60), but it can occur at any age. In neonatal myasthenia, the fetus may acquire immune proteins (antibodies) from a mother affected with myasthenia gravis. Generally, cases of neonatal myasthenia gravis are temporary and the child's symptoms usually disappear within 2-3 months after birth. Other children develop myasthenia gravis indistinguishable from adults. Myasthenia gravis in juveniles is uncommon. Myasthenia gravis is not directly inherited nor is it contagious. However, occasionally the disease may occur in more than one member of the same family. Rarely, children may show signs of congenital myasthenia or congenital myasthenic syndrome. These are not autoimmune disorders but are caused by defective genes that produce abnormal proteins instead of those that would normally produce acetylcholine, acetylcholinesterase (the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine), or the acetylcholine receptor and other proteins present along the muscle membrane."
What causes myasthenia gravis?,"'Myasthenia gravis is caused by a defect in the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles. It occurs when normal communication between the nerve and muscle is interrupted at the neuromuscular junction -- the place where nerve cells connect with the muscles they control. Normally when impulses travel down the nerve, the nerve endings release a neurotransmitter substance called acetylcholine. Acetylcholine travels from the neuromuscular junction and binds to acetylcholine receptors which are activated and generate a muscle contraction.'""In myasthenia gravis, antibodies block, alter, or destroy the receptors for acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, which prevents the muscle contraction from occurring. These antibodies are produced by the body's own immune system. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease because the immune system -- which normally protects the body from foreign organisms -- mistakenly attacks itself."" "
What procedures and test diagnose myasthenia gravis?,"'Because weakness is a common symptom of many other disorders, diagnosing myasthenia gravis often s missed or delayed (sometimes up to two years) in people who experience mild weakness or in those whose weakness is restricted to only a few muscles.''procedures and tests to diagnose myasthenia gravis include:'   Reviewing your medical history and will perform physical and neurological examinations. The doctor will look for impairment of eye movements or muscle weakness without any changes in your ability to feel things. If the doctor suspects myasthenia gravis, several tests are available to confirm the diagnosis. A special blood test can detect the presence of immune molecules or acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Most people with myasthenia gravis have abnormally elevated levels of these antibodies. Recently, a second antibody -- called the anti-MuSK antibody -- has been found in about 30% to 40% of people with myasthenia gravis who do not have acetylcholine receptor antibodies. This antibody also can be tested for in the blood. However, neither of these antibodies is present in some people with the disease. Usually, it occurs in those with ocular myasthenia gravis. The edrophonium test uses IV of edrophonium chloride to very briefly relieve weakness in people with myasthenia gravis. The drug blocks the degradation (breakdown) of acetylcholine and temporarily increases the levels of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Other methods to confirm the diagnosis include a version of nerve conduction study, which tests for specific muscle ""fatigue"" by repetitive nerve stimulation. This test records weakening muscle responses when the nerves are repetitively stimulated by small pulses of electricity. Repetitive stimulation of a nerve during a nerve conduction study may demonstrate gradual decreases of the muscle action potential due to impaired nerve-to-muscle transmission. Single fiber electromyography (EMG) detects impaired nerve-to-muscle transmission and measures the electrical potential of muscle cells when single muscle fibers are stimulated by electrical impulses. Muscle fibers in myasthenia gravis, as well as other neuromuscular disorders, do not respond as well to repeated electrical stimulation compared to muscles from normal people. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest may be used to identify the presence of a thymoma. Pulmonary function testing measures breathing strength and helps to predict whether respiration may fail and lead to a myasthenic crisis."
What is the treatment for myasthenia gravis?,"'Generally, myasthenia gravis can be managed. Several therapies are available that help reduce and improve muscle weakness.''Medications used for the treatment of myasthenia gravis include:''These medications improve muscle strength by suppressing the production of abnormal antibodies. They should be carefully monitored by your doctor because they may cause major side effects.'   Anticholinesterase agents, for example, neostigmine and pyridostigmine bromide (Mestinon), which help improve neuromuscular transmission and increase muscle strength. Immunosuppressive drugs, for exampleprednisoneazathioprineCyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetiltacrolimus prednisone azathioprine Cyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil tacrolimus"
What is the prognosis?,"'With treatment, most individuals with myasthenia can significantly improve their muscle weakness and lead normal or nearly normal lives. Some cases of myasthenia gravis may go into remission -- either temporarily or permanently -- and muscle weakness may disappear completely so that medications can be discontinued. Stable, long-lasting complete remissions are the goal of thymectomy and may occur in about 50 percent of individuals who undergo this procedure. In a few cases, the severe weakness of myasthenia gravis may cause respiratory failure, which requires immediate emergency medical care.' "
What research is being done?,"'Within the Federal government, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has primary responsibility for conducting and supporting research on brain and nervous system disorders, including myasthenia gravis.''Much has been learned about myasthenia gravis in recent years. Technological advances have led to more timely and accurate diagnosis, and new and enhanced therapies have improved management of the disorder. There is a greater understanding about the structure and function of the neuromuscular junction, the fundamental aspects of the thymus gland and of autoimmunity, and the disorder itself. Despite these advances, however, there is still much to learn. Researchers are seeking to learn what causes the autoimmune response in myasthenia gravis, and to better define the relationship between the thymus gland and myasthenia gravis.''Different drugs are being tested, either alone or in combination with existing drug therapies, to see if they are effective in treating myasthenia gravis. One study is examining the use of ''methotrexate'' therapy in individuals who develop symptoms and signs of the disease while on prednisone therapy. The drug suppresses blood cell activity that causes inflammation. Another study is investigating the use of ''rituximab'', a monoclonal antibody against B cells which make antibodies, to see if it decreases certain antibodies that cause the immune system to attack the nervous system. Investigators are also determining if eculizumab is safe and effective in treating individuals with generalized myasthenia gravis who also receive various immunosuppressant drugs.''Another study seeks further understanding of the molecular basis of synaptic transmission in the nervous system. The objective of this study is to expand current knowledge of the function of receptors and to apply this knowledge to the treatment of myasthenia gravis.''Thymectomy is also being studied in myasthenia gravis patients who do not have thymoma to assess long-term benefit the surgical procedure may have over medical therapy alone.''One study involves blood sampling to see if the immune system is making antibodies against components of the nerves and muscle. Researchers also hope to learn if these antibodies contribute to the development or worsening of myasthenia gravis and other illnesses of the nervous system.''Investigators are also examining the safety and efficacy of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to treat refractory and severe myasthenia gravis. Participants in this study will receive several days of treatment using the immumosuppressant drugs ''cyclophosphamide'' and antithymocyte globulin before having some of their peripheral blood cells harvested and frozen. The blood cells will later be thawed and infused intravenously into the respective individuals, whose symptoms will be monitored for five years.' "

What is microcephaly?,'Microcephaly is a medical condition in which the circumference of the head is smaller than normal because the brain has not developed properly or has stopped growing. Microcephaly can be present at birth or it may develop in the first few years of life.' 
What causes microcephaly?,"'It is most often caused by genetic abnormalities that interfere with the growth of the cerebral cortex during the early months of ''fetal development''. It is associated with '""Down's syndrome""', chromosomal syndromes, and neurometabolic syndromes. ''Babies'' may also be born with microcephaly if, during pregnancy, their mother abused drugs or alcohol, became infected with a ''cytomegalovirus'', ''rubella'' (''German measles''), or ''varicella'' (''chicken pox'') virus, was exposed to certain toxic chemicals, or had untreated ''phenylketonuria'' (PKU).''Babies born with microcephaly will have a smaller than normal head that will fail to grow as they progress through infancy.' "
What are microcephaly symptoms and signs?,"'Depending on the severity of the accompanying syndrome, children with microcephaly may have''Some children with microcephaly will have normal intelligence and a head that will grow bigger, but they will track below the normal growth curves for head circumference.'   impaired cognitive development, delayed motor functions and speech, facial distortions, dwarfism or short stature, hyperactivity, seizures, difficulties with coordination and balance, and other brain or neurological abnormalities."
Is there any treatment for microcephaly?,"""There is no treatment for microcephaly that can return a child's head to a normal size or shape. Treatment focuses on ways to decrease the impact of the associated deformities and neurological disabilities. Children with microcephaly and developmental delays are usually evaluated by a pediatric ""'neurologist'' and followed by a medical management team. Early childhood intervention programs that involve physical, speech, and occupational therapists help to maximize abilities and minimize dysfunction. Medications are often used to control seizures, hyperactivity, and neuromuscular symptoms. Genetic counseling may help families understand the risk for microcephaly in subsequent pregnancies.'  "
What is the prognosis for microcephaly?,"'Some children will only have mild disability. Others, especially if they are otherwise growing and developing normally, will have normal intelligence and continue to develop and meet regular age-appropriate milestones.' "
What research is being done on microcephaly?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) conducts research relating to microcephaly in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. A small group of researchers studying a rare neurometabolic syndrome (3-PGDH), which causes microcephaly, have successfully used amino acid replacement therapy to reduce and prevent seizures.' "

What is microdermabrasion?,"'Microdermabrasion is a very popular, machine-assisted skin-exfoliating treatment. Microdermabrasion has advantages of low risk and rapid recovery compared to the other more invasive resurfacing methods such as ''dermabrasion'', chemical peeling, and ''laser resurfacing''. Since microdermabrasion produces only a very superficial depth of skin removal, it works best on improving conditions on the surface of the skin such as early photoaging (sun damage), fine lines, ''age spots'', ''acne'', and superficial scarring, although the results are not dramatic. Although the face is the most common area for microdermabrasion, any skin area, including neck, chest, back, and hands, may be treated. Microdermabrasion is sometimes referred to as ""microderm,"" lunchtime peel, Parisian Peel, and Diamond Peel.''Microdermabrasion is a painless, noninvasive, skin-rejuvenation procedure using a combination of a fine abrasive tip or crystals and vacuum suction applied to the skin. There are no needles or anesthetics required for microdermabrasion. The vacuum pressure and speed are adjusted depending on the sensitivity and tolerance of the skin. Microdermabrasion is often compared to the feeling of a cat licking your face, a rough but gentle texture. Typical microdermabrasion sessions can last anywhere from five to 60 minutes. Minimal to no recovery time is required after microdermabrasion and most people immediately return to daily activity after a session. ''Makeup'' and nonirritating creams can usually be applied right after microdermabrasion. Studies have shown that microdermabrasion can even temporarily facilitate the absorption of some topical medications through increasing the permeability of the skin.''Microdermabrasion works by removing a few of the top layers of the skin called the stratum corneum. Much like brushing your ''teeth'', microderm helps to gently remove ""plaque"" and skin debris. Since human skin typically regenerates at approximately 30-day intervals, skin improvement with microdermabrasion is temporary and needs to be repeated at average intervals of two to four weeks for continued improvement. Multiple treatments in combination with ''sunscreen'', sun avoidance, and other skin-care creams yield best results.''Microdermabrasion should not be confused with ''dermabrasion'' which is an invasive surgical procedure performed typically by dermatologists or ''plastic'' surgeons under local or general anesthesia. Dermabrasion is a procedure for deeper ''acne'' ''scars''. Dermabrasion requires anesthesia and would be too painful otherwise. Dermabrasion is also performed for certain types of deep scars.' "
Who should consider microdermabrasion?,"'Microdermabrasion is somewhat useful for people with dull or sallow skin, mild ''acne'', ''acne'' discoloration, pick marks, and very superficial ''acne'' scars. Microdermabrasion may be a good treatment option for patients with superficial skin problems and busy lifestyles who are looking for minimal benefits with virtually no side effects or downtime. Individuals with deeper ''acne'' scars may expect a much longer series of treatments or likely benefit from physician-performed surgical dermabrasion, chemical peeling or ''laser resurfacing''. ' "
How does microdermabrasion work?,"'Traditionally, a crystal microdermabrasion system contains a pump, a connecting tube, a hand piece, and a vacuum. While the pump creates a high-pressure stream of inert crystals, such as aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, sodium chloride, and ''sodium bicarbonate'', to abrade the skin, the vacuum removes the crystals and exfoliated skin cells. Alternatively, the inert crystals can be replaced by a roughened surface of the tip in the diamond microdermabrasion system. '""Unlike the crystal microdermabrasion system, the diamond microdermabrasion machine does not produce particles from crystals that may be inhaled into a patient's nose or blown into the eyes. Hence, diamond microdermabrasion is safer for use on areas around the eyes and lips. Generally, the slower the movement of the hand piece against the skin and the more numbers of passes over the skin, the deeper the treatment. ""  "
What ages are appropriate for microdermabrasion?,"'While there are no specific age or sex restrictions, typically children over age 12 up to adults age 65 can get microdermabrasion. While there is no age maximum, mature skin over age 70 may have slightly higher risks of ''bruising'' and skin abrasions. Individuals younger than age 12 may sometimes also receive treatment under the care of a dermatologist or ''plastic surgeon''. ' "
How often can I have microdermabrasion?,"""Microdermabrasion can be done as frequently as weekly or up to every eight weeks depending on your skin's tolerance and desired cosmetic effects. Many people choose to start with weekly treatments for three sessions, then change to a monthly maintenance regimen.""'Much like brushing your ''teeth'', microdermabrasion helps to gently remove skin debris. Since human skin typically regenerates at approximately 30-day intervals, skin improvement with microdermabrasion is temporary and needs to be repeated at average intervals of two to four weeks for continued improvement. Usually, multiple treatments (six to 12 sessions) are recommended to see a significant improvement.' "
What does the vacuum do in microdermabrasion?,'The vacuum part of microdermabrasion has four basic roles:' It gently pulls and lifts a small section of skin for micro abrasion. It can spray a stream of crystals across the targeted skin area. It focally stimulates blood circulation and creates mild swelling in the skin. It collects the used crystals and dead skin in a receptacle for easy disposal.
"What should people expect before, during, and after microdermabrasion?","'Generally, softer and smoother skin that feels fresher and more rejuvenated is the expected outcome after microdermabrasion. Before starting the microdermabrasion treatment, eye protection such as eye pads or goggles may be placed. Often the skin may be prepared and cleaned of ''makeup'' and oils. Yet, no tlocal anesthetic is required. The skin will be stretched to provide some tension in order to achieve the most effective abrasion and vacuum. The hand piece is moved over the skin with repeated single, smooth passes. Usually, two to four passes per area are sufficient.''Mild pinkness of the skin is the desired outcome and usually resolves within minutes to hours after microdermabrasion. In addition, mild exfoliation of skin may occur as well. Continuously apply moisturizer or ointment if exfoliation occurs. Patients may also experience mild ''sunburn''-like sensation for a few days. Moreover, liberal application of ''sunscreen'' is recommended as ''photosensitivity'' may be increased after treatment.''Microdermabrasion may help stimulate the production of collagen, thereby helping skin rejuvenation. As ''age spots'' from photoaging and fine lines are diminished, the skin may become softer and smoother. The results are modest, however.' "
Does microdermabrasion help with acne scars?,"'Microdermabrasion may be very useful for people with active acne, mild acne discoloration, pick marks, and very superficial or raised acne scars. Dermatologists use microdermabrasion to help unclog pores and clear acne. Often used in combination with gentle glycolic peels and medical acne extractions, microderm can help speed up acne clearing.''Individuals with deeper acne scars might be candidates for surgical dermabrasion or laser resurfacing.' "
Can microdermabrasion help with melasma?,"'Yes, microderm can be helpful in treating ''melasma'' and other types of ''hyperpigmentation''. Optimal ''melasma'' treatment might typically include biweekly or monthly microderm combined with glycolic acid peels, fading creams like hydroquinone 4%, and daily sunscreens. Multiple treatments in combination with sunscreen and sun avoidance and other creams help yield best results, although permanent improvement is not to be expected. ' "
Does medical insurance pay for microdermabrasion?,"'Microdermabrasion is almost always considered cosmetic and not covered by traditional medical insurance companies. Since microderm is often used to treat medical conditions like acne, acne scarring, ''melasma'', and ''keratosis pilaris'', it may be possible to deduct some costs as medical expenses. In appropriate cases, payment options may include using benefits of plans like health savings accounts (HSA) or health remittance accounts (HRA) to pay for microderm. You will want to check the specific benefits and provisions of your plan and also review your tax deductions with a tax professional.' "
Can microdermabrasion help with keratosis pilaris?,"'Microdermabrasion can help temporarily improve the appearance of ''keratosis'' pilaris (especially on the upper arms). Optimally, the microdermabrasion is given biweekly or monthly and is combined with lactic-acid lotions like ''Lac-Hydrin'' lotion or ''AmLactin'"" and weekly glycolic-acid peels. Don't expect great results in this condition."" "
What are possible side effects of microdermabrasion?,"'Potential side effects of microdermabrasion are minimal and this is a very safe procedure. Potential drawbacks are very limited in that microderm only affects the ''epidermis'', which is the outermost skin layer. Common minor, temporary side effects include slight skin tightness, redness, ''bruising'', and sensitivity. As a general rule, the greater the potential benefits with a cosmetic treatment, the greater the potential risks and side effects. The possible risks with more aggressive treatments like dermabrasion and laser are much greater than microdermabrasion.''Possible side effects of microdermabrasion include''Cold'' sore reactivation may uncommonly occur after microderm around lips. If you have had a lot of previous ''cold sores'', consider either avoiding treatment around the lip borders or asking your doctor about taking an antiviral pill prophylactically. A typical ''cold sore'' ''prevention'' regimen may be to start an antiviral pill like ''acyclovir'' (''Zovirax'') 800 mg or ''valacyclovir'' (''Valtrex'') 1 gram once a day starting the day before and continuing for one to two days after your treatment. Antiviral creams are not effective ''cold'' sore ''prevention''.''Overly aggressive microderm may cause breaks in skin and resulting post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Also overaggressive treatment may cause an increased risk of bruising (ecchymosis), especially if you are taking ''aspirin'' or other blood thinners like ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'') or ''clopidogrel bisulfate'' (''Plavix''). Since microdermabrasion only causes superficial skin removal, scarring and pigment changes are very rare if the procedure is performed correctly.''There may be a small possibility of increased surface blood vessels (telangiectasia), particularly if you have very thin skin, ''scleroderma'', ''lupus'', severe sun damage, taken long-term ''prednisone'' (''Deltasone'', Orasone, Prednicen-M, ''Liquid Pred''), or other conditions where your skin is abnormally fragile and prone to forming telangiectasia.''In addition, if an individual is on ''isotretinoin'' (Accutane) or has taken this medication within the previous six to 12 months, resurfacing treatments such as microdermabrasion may not be appropriate due to the potential increased risk of scarring. As the potential risk is very slight, some dermatologists may treat patients on isotretonion with gentler sessions.' skin tightness, redness, minor bruising, skin sensitivity, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), small skin abrasions, spots of bleeding, eye-skin bruising (especially if you are taking aspirin or other blood thinners), fine broken blood vessels (telangiectasia), and cold sore reactivation around lips."
How effective are at-home microdermabrasion kits?,"'Most home microdermabrasion machines and kits are generally weaker than in-office, professional treatments. These at-home microdermabrasion kits often cannot provide the depth of skin abrasion or remove the dead skin cells by vacuuming as professional microdermabrasion. '""Several skin-care companies, such as L'Oréal, Ponds, and Neutrogena, are now producing microdermabrasion at-home kits. Usually, the microdermabrasion at-home system contains an abrasive cream or scrub and a tool for application. The main active component in creams may include aluminum oxide crystals, which are used in the professional microdermabrasion equipment. Microdermabrasion cloths are also available in the skin-care products on the market now. Basically, the tightly woven microfibers of the cloths abrade the skin and remove surface cells to achieve the result of skin resurfacing. "" "
How much does at home microdermabrasion cost?,"'There are two types of home microdermabrasion: creams and machines. Creams may seem less expensive initially but require continuous replenishment. A quality microderm machine may potentially be a good investment and typically should not have much consumables or disposable parts costs over its lifetime.''Many microdermabrasion at-home creams cost $10-$95, which usually provides about 20-30 treatments, while some can be over $100. Once the jar is used up, so is your initial investment. These creams often use the aluminum oxide crystals or other sand-like fine debris to help manually ''exfoliate'"" the skin. Multiple vendors, including L'Oréal, offer a microdermabrasion cream kit for an average of $10-$30.""'More recently, a new series of mini home microdermabrasion units have become available and are sold commercially. New home units retail from $150-$300 and may be available at Sephora.com and Amazon.com. A novel home unit called vacuubrasion will be made available for under $50.' "
What home remedies can produce results like microdermabrasion?,"'There are multiple ways to exfoliate the skin: ' Use a pumice stone, loofah, or Buf-Puf. Use beach sand to gently exfoliate. Prepare homemade brown sugar and honey rubs. Apply sea salt rubs. Apply Epsom salts scrubs."
What is the average cost of professional microdermabrasion?,"""Microdermabrasion costs may range from $100-$250, the average cost being around $100 per session. Costs have decreased considerably over the last five to 10 years as these units have become more readily available. Professional microdermabrasion can usually be obtained in a doctor's office, typically dermatologists or ""'plastic'' surgeons, as well as aesthetic spas, and facial clinics. Microdermabrasion is quite affordable and much less expensive than other skin-resurfacing treatments such as dermabrasion or laser peels, which may cost around $2,500. However, they are not nearly as beneficial as the more expensive procedures.' "
Where can people get more information on microdermabrasion?,"""The treatment of microdermabrasion can be performed by a physician, a nurse, aesthetician, or other trained medical personnel. It is recommended for patients to consult a dermatologist or medical aesthetician before starting any resurfacing treatment. Careful evaluation on the patient's skin for changes in texture, severity of photoaging, depth of scarring, and the type of skin from a specialist will help patients select the proper resurfacing modality in order to address the skin problems effectively.

What is microsporidiosis? What causes the disease?,"'Microsporidiosis is a disease caused by infection with microscopic organisms called microsporidia. Microsporidia are eukaryotic parasites that must live within other host cells in which they can produce infective spores. These spores cause microsporidiosis, a disease that is primarily seen in individuals infected with ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV''), although it can rarely also cause disease in individuals with a normal immune system. Microsporidia are found worldwide, and there are numerous vertebrates and invertebrates that can serve as hosts for this parasite.''Microsporidiosis can cause infection of the intestine, lung, kidney, brain, sinuses, muscles, and eyes. Although there are over 1,200 species of microsporidia, there are 15 species that have been identified as causing disease in humans.' "
What are risk factors for microsporidiosis?,"'The main risk factor associated with acquiring microsporidiosis is immunodeficiency. The vast majority of cases of microsporidiosis occur in individuals with a compromised immune system, primarily in people with ''HIV/AIDS''-related immunosuppression. It can also affect immunocompromised individuals such as organ-transplant recipients, people with ''diabetes'', ''cancer'' patients, and those who are chronically on steroids. Rarely, microsporidiosis can occur in healthy people with a normal immune system.' "
Is microsporidiosis contagious?,"'Though the route of spread is poorly understood, studies have suggested that humans may possibly contract microsporidia via sexual transmission with an infected individual. Transmission from human to human may also possibly occur via the fecal-oral route or through direct contact with ''ocular'' secretions from infected individuals.' "
What is the incubation period for microsporidiosis?,'The exact incubation period for microsporidiosis in humans has not been definitively established for all species.' 
How are microsporidia transmitted?,"'Microsporidia spores are released from the ''stool'', respiratory secretions, and urine of infected animals. A number of animals, including insects, birds, and mammals, can serve as reservoirs of infection for microsporidia. Transmission of these spores is thought to occur primarily via ingestion or ''inhalation'' by humans, though the process is not perfectly understood. Studies have also suggested that water-borne and food-borne transmission may be possible.''Once within a cell, the microsporidia develop and multiply, producing more spores. The infective spores are then released when the cell expands and bursts.' "
What symptoms does microsporidiosis cause?,"'Although microsporidiosis can occur in people with normal immune systems, it is very uncommon. The symptoms of microsporidiosis primarily occur in people with immune-system deficiency, such as ''HIV''-infected individuals and organ-transplant recipients. Microsporidiosis can cause intestinal, lung, kidney, brain, sinus, muscle, or eye disease.''Intestinal symptoms that are caused by microsporidia infection include chronic ''diarrhea'', wasting, malabsorption, and ''gallbladder disease''. In patients with ''AIDS'', the chronic ''diarrhea'' may be extremely debilitating and carries a significant mortality (death) risk. The majority of cases of intestinal microsporidiosis in ''AIDS'' patients are caused by ''Enterocytozoon bieneusi''.''Lung symptoms may include a ''cough'' and difficult, labored ''breathing''. A ''chest X-ray'' may show signs of inflammation, fluid, or ''cavities'' in the ''lungs''.''Microsporidiosis can cause infection in the urinary tract, ''kidney failure'', bladder inflammation, and bowel perforation. Microsporidia can also spread throughout the body (disseminate) to cause inflammation in the brain, pancreas, sinuses, and muscle tissue.''Eye infection with microsporidia can cause inflammation of the ''cornea'' and ''conjunctiva'' (keratoconjunctivitis). Symptoms of ocular microsporidiosis may include ''eye pain'', ''eye redness'', or blurry vision.' "
How do health-care professionals diagnose microsporidiosis?,"'There are several tests available to diagnose microsporidia infection. Microscopic examination of stained samples of body fluids, primarily fecal samples, allows for rapid diagnosis, although the exact species of microsporidia may not be identified. Urine samples can also be used to detect spores when the kidney and/or bladder are involved.''A powerful microscope, called a transmission electron microscope, is needed to identify the exact species of microsporidia. However, this form of testing is expensive, and it is not available for routine use in all laboratories.''Other methods, such as immunofluorescence assays and ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR'') testing, can also identify microsporidia infection in the research-laboratory setting.''Finally, blood tests and imaging studies can also assist in detecting microsporidiosis.' "
What types of specialists treat microsporidiosis?,"'Microsporidiosis is generally treated primarily by an infectious-disease specialist. Other specialists may be consulted depending on the site of infection, such as an ophthalmologist for eye involvement.' "
What is the treatment for microsporidiosis?,"'The treatment of microsporidiosis is generally achieved with medications and supportive care. Depending on the site of infection and the microsporidia species involved, different medications are utilized. The most commonly used medications for microsporidiosis include ''albendazole'' (''Albenza'') and fumagillin.''For patients with diarrhea and ''dehydration'', intravenous fluid administration and ''electrolyte'' repletion may be necessary. Dietary and nutritional regimens may also assist with chronic diarrhea. Finally, improvement of immune system function with antiretroviral therapy in ''HIV''-infected individuals may also lead to improvement of symptoms.' "
What is the prognosis of microsporidiosis?,"'In general, the prognosis of microsporidiosis in healthy individuals with a normal immune system is good. However, immunocompromised individuals who develop microsporidiosis have a more guarded prognosis, with the outcome determined by the site of infection, the severity of infection, and the time elapsed to seek prompt medical treatment. Microsporidiosis in these individuals can sometimes be fatal.' "
Is it possible to prevent microsporidiosis?,"'For patients with HIV infection, microsporidiosis may be prevented by maintaining an intact immune system through the use of antiretroviral medications. Frequent hand washing and limiting exposure to potential sources of infection are also recommended. Because of the possibility of sexual transmission, safe sexual practices are an important preventive step. At this time, there is no ''vaccine'' available to prevent microsporidiosis.' "
Doula vs. midwife quick comparison of differences,"'Doulas and midwives are both professionals who assist with ''childbirth'' and women’s ''reproductive health''. A doula provides support to the mother before, during, and shortly after ''childbirth'', but does not deliver the baby. A midwife may offer gynecological examinations, ''birth control'' counseling, prescriptions, and ''labor and delivery'' care.''The laws of each state regarding certification and licensing affect the exact types of services that a midwife can perform.' "
What is a doula? Can a doula deliver babies?,"'A doula provides physical, emotional, and informational support to an expectant mother before, during, and after ''childbirth''. A doula focuses on an expectant mother’s own needs, which enables her to have a memorable and empowering experience while giving birth. While in most cases the term “doula,” implies a professional who is present during the birth, there also are doulas who specialize in antepartum (before birth) care and postpartum care. A doula typically helps a woman prepare a birth plan.''A birth doula remains with the mother during birth, offering relaxation and ''breathing'' technique support, as well as comforting services like ''massage'', and assistance with labor positions; however, doulas are not medically trained, and cannot deliver babies. A doula is not a substitute for having a woman’s partner at the birth. Doulas encourage participation from the partner, and offer support and reassurance to the partner as well.' "
What is a midwife? Can a midwife deliver a baby?,"'A midwife is a health care professional. Depending upon the laws of the US state in which the midwife practices, a midwife may perform gynecological examinations (for example, Pap smears, pelvic exams, and breast exams), write prescriptions, care for a woman during labor and delivery, perform fetal monitoring, and provide information about ''contraception''. A midwife usually seeks to eliminate or minimize unnecessary technological interventions, believing that ''pregnancy'' and birth are normal life processes. However, a midwife also is skilled at identifying and referring women who need the services of an obstetrician during the birth.\xa0A midwife is medically trained and qualified to deliver babies.''Some midwives also are trained as nurses. A nurse-midwife usually can offer the greatest variety of health-care services to women.' "
Do doulas and midwives require certifications?,"'The American Midwifery Certification Board (AMCB) is the US national certifying body for certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) and certified midwives (CMs). Midwifery education programs involve graduate study and usually require a Bachelors Degree for entry. Some programs will accept applicants with a Bachelor’s degree in a field other than ''nursing'', while others require a Bachelor’s degree in nursing. Midwifery education programs in the United States are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Midwifery Education (ACME). According to the AMCB, legal recognition for CNMs and CMs varies among states.''A doula does not necessarily have medical training, and there is no formal licensing required. However, many doulas choose training and certification by organizations that oversee doula training programs, such as DONA International™ and the Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (CAPPA).' "
Similarities between doula vs. midwife, 
Differences between a doula vs. midwife,"'A doula and a midwife offer different types of services, even though both may support the childbirth experience.''Midwives have medical training and during the birth process, focus on delivering a healthy baby.''Doulas, on the other hand, focus on the needs of the mother, offering mental, physical, and emotional support. Doulas do not have medical training or experience and cannot be used a substitute for a midwife or doctor.' "
Can I use both a doula and midwife for my pregnancy and birth?,"'Yes, many women opt to use both a doula and midwife, although it is not required that a woman use both if using one or the other.' "
When should a doctor be consulted during pregnancy or assisted birth?,"'A midwife is trained to recognize an emergency or situation that requires medical care from a doctor. Midwives are trained to handle normal ''pregnancies'', but obstetrical care is required for certain situations, and for pregnancies deemed to be at high risk. Many doctors have nurse-midwives in their practices that work alongside your doctor’s team, and may manage normal pregnancies if the woman wishes.''Obstetricians (OB-GYN physicians) can manage high-risk pregnancies and can perform surgeries, including C-sections, when necessary. Midwives are prohibited from performing C-sections or using forceps and vacuums during the delivery process. The midwife will seek obstetrical care by a doctor should a birth complication arise that requires one of these interventions, or an emergency that threatens the mother or baby.' "
How much does a doula cost? How much does a midwife cost?,"'The costs for doulas and midwives, as for any health-care service, vary according to the specific provider and the geographic location. A doula typically charges a flat fee for service, meaning an agreed-upon number of prenatal visits, being on-call for support during your pregnancy, support during your labor and birth, and at least one postpartum visit. Other services may be included in the package. The costs for a doula can be $1,000 or more in major cities and substantially less in other areas.''For a midwife, the cost also varies by location. An average cost of a midwife is around $2,000, but midwives’ fees may be covered by some insurance policies. These fees typically cover all prenatal visits, the birth, and postpartum visits. Some midwives may offer sliding scales, reduced fees, or payment plans for some women.' "

A chronic migraine is a migraine headache that lasts for more than 15 days per month for three consecutive months. Status migrainosus is a constant migraine attack that lasts more than 72 hours. Other types of headaches can also cause intense pain, and not all headaches are migraines. For example, some describe the pain of cluster headaches as the worst pain they have experienced. Sinus headaches can also cause pain and inflammation. The causes of migraines are not known. Changes in neurotransmitter levels within the brain are thought to play a role. The presence of typical clinical signs and symptoms help diagnose migraines. Migraine attacks can be triggered by many factors, for example:Hormonal changesStressStrong stimuli like loud noisesCertain foods Hormonal changes Stress Strong stimuli like loud noises Certain foods Migraine treatment usually is with over-the-counter (OTC) migraine medication or prescription drugs. Prescription medications used to relieve the pain of migraine include triptans (a class of drugs), for example:sumatriptan (Imitrex, Alsuma, Imitrex STATdose System, Sumavel DosePro, Zecuity, Treximet)rizatriptan (Maxalt, Maxalt-MLT)eletriptan (Relpax)zolmitriptan (Zomig, Zomig-ZMT)naratriptan Amerge)almotriptan (Axert)frovatriptan (Frova) sumatriptan (Imitrex, Alsuma, Imitrex STATdose System, Sumavel DosePro, Zecuity, Treximet) rizatriptan (Maxalt, Maxalt-MLT) eletriptan (Relpax) zolmitriptan (Zomig, Zomig-ZMT) naratriptan Amerge) almotriptan (Axert) frovatriptan (Frova) A new drug class called a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (CGRP-R) antagonist was approved in 2018 to treat chronic migraine. It is a periodic injection, given monthly or quarterly, to prevent migraines. This class of medication includes erenumab (Aimovig), fremanezumab (Ajovy), and galcanezumab (Emgality). Some patients with chronic migraine receive botulinum toxin (Botox) injections every three months to help treat their headaches.

What is a migraine headache?,"'Although the term ""migraine"" is often used to describe any severe ''headache'', a migraine headache is the result of specific physiologic changes that occur within the brain, and lead to the characteristic pain and associated symptoms of a migraine.''Migraines usually are associated with sensitivity to sound, light, and smells. A migraine attack may be accompanied by ''nausea'' or ''vomiting''. This type of headache often involves only one side of the head, but in some cases, patients may have pain bilaterally or on both sides. The pain is often described as throbbing or pounding and it may be made worse with physical exertion.''Not all headaches represent migraines, and migraine is not the only condition that can cause severe and debilitating headaches. For example, cluster headaches are very severe headaches that affect one side of the head in a recurrent manner (occurring in a ""cluster"" over time). The pain is sometimes described as ""drilling,"" and can be worse than migraine pain in some cases. Cluster headaches are less common than migraine.''Tension headaches are a more common cause of headache. These occur due to contraction of the muscles of the ''scalp'', face, and neck.' "
What is migraine with aura?,"'In some cases, people with migraines have specific warning symptoms, or an aura, prior to the onset of their headache. These warning signs can range from flashing lights or a blind spot in one eye to numbness or weakness involving one side of the body. The ''migraine aura'' may last for several minutes, and then resolves as the head pain begins or may last until the headache resolves. For patients who have never had an aura, it can be frightening and can mimic the symptoms of a ''stroke''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of migraine headaches?,"'The most common ''symptoms of migraine'' are:''The International Headache Society defines ''episodic migraine'' as being unilateral (meaning on one side of the head), pulsing discomfort of moderate-to-severe intensity, which is aggravated by physical activity and associated with nausea and/or vomiting as well as ''photophobia'' and/or phonophobia (sensitivity to light and sound).''A ''tension headache'' is described as being bilateral and the pain is not pulsating, but feels like pressure or tightness. While severity can be mild-to-moderate, the headache is not disabling and there is no worsening of the pain with routine physical activity; additionally, there is no associated nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia.''A migraine headache typically lasts for several hours up to several days.'

   Severe, often ""pounding,"" pain, usually on one side of the head Nausea and/or vomiting Sensitivity to light Sensitivity to sound Eye pain Many people describe their headache as a one-sided, pounding type of pain, with nausea and sensitivity to light, sound, or smells (known as photophobia, phonophobia, and osmophobia). In some cases, the discomfort may be bilateral (both sides of the head). The pain of a migraine is often graded as moderate to severe in intensity. Physical activity or exertion (walking upstairs, rushing to catch a bus or train) will worsen the symptoms. Up to one-third of people with migraines have an aura, or a specific neurologic symptom, before their headache begins. Frequently, the aura is a visual disturbance described as a temporary blindness that obscures part of the visual field. Some describe flashing lights in one or both eyes, sometimes surrounding a blind spot. Other symptoms, including numbness or weakness along one side, or speech disturbances, occur rarely. Some people describe visual symptoms of loss of vision, which lasts for less than an hour, and may or may not be associated with head pain once the vision returns, as an ocular migraine. This is also known as retinal migraine, and may be associated with symptoms similar to those described as an aura, such as blind spots, complete loss of vision in one eye, or flashing lights. Patients who experience these symptoms regularly need evaluation to exclude a primary retinal problem. Eye pain, which is different from sensitivity to light, is not a common component of migraine. If eye pain is persistent, or if eye pain is present and accompanied by blurred vision or loss of vision, then seek prompt evaluation."
What causes migraine headaches?,"'The specific cause of migraines is not known, but there may be fluctuations in certain neurotransmitters, chemicals that send messages between brain cells. These changes may predispose some people to develop migraine headaches.'  "
What foods and other things trigger migraines?,"'Many factors have been identified as ''migraine triggers''.''Changes in barometric pressure have been described as leading to migraine headaches.''Not every individual who has migraine attacks will experience one when exposed to these triggers. If a person is unsure what specific triggers might cause a migraine, maintaining a headache diary can be beneficial to identify those individual factors that lead to migraine.'   Normal hormone fluctuations, which occur with regular menstrual cycles, and some types of oral contraceptives (birth control pills) Various foods such as:Red winesAged cheesesPreservatives used in smoked meats (nitrates)Monosodium glutamateArtificial sweetenersChocolateDairy productsAlcoholic beverages Red wines Aged cheeses Preservatives used in smoked meats (nitrates) Monosodium glutamate Artificial sweeteners Chocolate Dairy products Alcoholic beverages Stress Oversleeping Exposure to strong stimuli such as bright lights, loud noises, or strong smells"
How can you tell if it is a migraine or a different type of headache?,"'No specific physical findings are found when patients are experiencing a routine migraine headache. If an abnormality is identified on physical examination, there should be suspicion of other possible causes for the headache.''According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3 (ICHD) criteria for migraine without aura, a patient must have had at least five headache attacks fulfilling the following criteria:''Imaging the brain with an ''MRI'' and ''CT scans'' or performing a brain wave test (''electroencephalogram'' [''EEG'""]) is not necessary if the patient's physical examination is normal."" Headache attacks lasting 4 to 72 hours (untreated or unsuccessfully treated) The headache has at least two of the following characteristics:Unilateral locationPulsating qualityModerate or severe pain intensityAggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity (for example, walking or climbing stairs) Unilateral location Pulsating quality Moderate or severe pain intensity Aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity (for example, walking or climbing stairs) During the headache, at least one of the following characteristics:Nausea and/or vomitingPhotophobia and/or phonophobia Nausea and/or vomiting Photophobia and/or phonophobia The headache cannot be attributed to another disorder."
What are the treatments guidelines for migraine headaches?,"'Migraine headache treatment can vary due to several factors. Usually, the treatment for migraines depends upon how frequently they occur, the type of medicine prescribed to prevent triggers and attacks or provide pain relief, and how long they last.'

  "
Medications for acute and chronic migraines,"'The treatment of an ''acute migraine headache ''may vary from over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, like ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'' and others), ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'', etc.), ''naproxen'' sodium (''Aleve'') to prescription medications.' Triptans (sumatriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, almotriptan, and frovatriptan), may be extremely effective in treating migraines and may be prescribed to help patients treat their migraines at home. A combination of naproxen and sumatriptan is now available. Additionally, sumatriptan is now available as a patch, which delivers the medication though the skin. Not every patient can take these medications, and there are specific limitations regarding how often these medications can be used. Other medication regimens may also be used to control migraine headache. Some medications are appropriate for home use and others require a visit to the doctor's office or emergency department. Dihydroergotamine (DHE 45) can be administered intravenously or by nasal spray; this medication cannot be used if a triptan has been used within the preceding 24 hours. Diclofenac potassium for oral solution (Cambia) is a potent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication approved for treatment of migraine. Antiemetic medications, including intravenous (IV) metoclopramide, and IV or intramuscular (IM) chlorpromazine and prochlorperazine can be used both to relieve nausea and vomiting and to rid migraine pain."
Narcotics for pain,"'Narcotic pain medications are not necessarily appropriate for the treatment of migraine headaches and are associated with the phenomenon of rebound headache, where the headache returns -- sometimes more intensely -- when the narcotics wear off. In all cases of migraine, the use of acute pain therapies must be watched closely so that a patient does not develop medication overuse headache.''Too frequent use of many of the medications used to treat migraine headache can lead to increased headache occurrence, or even daily headaches. This type of headache phenomenon is known as medication overuse headache.' "
Migraine prevention medications,"'If an individual experiences frequent headaches, or if the headaches routinely last for several days, then preventive medications may be indicated. These may be prescribed on a daily basis in an effort to decrease the frequency, severity, and duration of migraine headaches. There are many different medications which have been shown to be effective in this role, including:''The specific migraine headache treatment that is selected for a patient is dependent on many other factors, including age, sex, blood pressure, and other pre-existing medical conditions.''Other patients may find that use of one of the new calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, including erenumab (Aimovig), fremanezumab (Ajovy), or galcanezumab (Emgality) is beneficial to decrease their migraine frequency. These medications are injected monthly or quarterly (every 3 months) to treat migraine.' blood pressure medications, for example, propranolol (Inderal), nadolol (Corgard), verapamil (Clan, Covera, Isoptin, Verelan), and flunarizine), anti-seizure medications, for example, divalproex sodium (Depakote and others), topiramate (Topamax), and gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise), antidepressant medications (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and venlafaxine) and other supplements (magnesium, butterbur, and riboflavin)."
What natural home remedies and lifestyle changes relieve migraines?,"'Migraine patients can play a significant role in managing their headache frequency and severity.''Keep track of when migraines occur by using a headache diary or log to track pain levels, triggers, and symptoms. In addition, patients should keep track of the migraine types they experience (an individual can experience more than one type of migraine). This can help identify patterns that precede a migraine, as well as help identify factors that contribute to the development of the headache. Once these contributing factors are known, lifestyle modifications can lessen their impact. These modifications may include:''Some people find that exercises that promote muscle relaxation can help manage the pain of migraines. Examples of types of mind-body exercises that can help encourage relaxation are:''There is no specific ''diet'' for people with migraines that will help relieve symptoms. However, certain foods can be triggers for migraines in susceptible people. These foods include:''Understanding the particular triggers of your migraines and avoiding them may help some sufferers decrease the frequency of attacks.'   Maintain a regular schedule for eating and sleeping.Avoid certain foods that might cause a migraine.Keep well hydrated since dehydration has been identified as a migraine trigger for some people.Exercise regularly. Avoid certain foods that might cause a migraine. Keep well hydrated since dehydration has been identified as a migraine trigger for some people. Exercise regularly. Relaxation strategies and meditation also have been recognized as effective strategies to prevent migraines and decrease their severity. Meditation Progressive muscle relaxation Guided imagery Yoga Red wines Aged cheeses Preservatives used in smoked meats (nitrates) Monosodium glutamate Artificial sweeteners Chocolate Alcoholic beverages Dairy products"
What is the treatment for migraines during pregnancy? Can you take medication?,"'Many women find their headaches stabilize or even resolve during ''pregnancy''. This may be related to more consistent hormone levels that occur during pregnancy. To decrease the risk of ''birth defects'', certain medications used to prevent migraines may need to be discontinued prior to a pregnancy.''There are limited studies of drugs used to treat migraines during pregnancy. Acetaminophen is relatively safe when used in recommended doses. If a you are ''pregnant'' and are experiencing frequent headaches, your doctor or other health care professional may provide treatment alternatives. Many migraine medicines, including the triptans, are not well studied in pregnancy, so the doctor needs to weigh the potential benefits to the patient against the risks to the fetus before prescribing these medications.' "
What is the treatment for migraines in children?,"'Migraines may occur in children. Treatment is similar to the treatment of migraines in adults, but drug dosages may need to be adjusted because of the smaller size of the patients.' Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are often effective in controlling acute headaches. For more severe or refractory headaches, some of the triptans have been identified as being beneficial. If headaches occur frequently, daily medication may be needed for prevention. Diet, regular sleep patterns, routine exercise, and biofeedback, are all potentially beneficial in decreasing the frequency and severity of migraines in children. The use of a headache diary is a helpful tool to identify and avoid migraine triggers."
What is the prognosis for a person with migraines? Is there a cure?,"'Most people who have migraines find that their headaches may be controlled with the preventive medications and lifestyle changes. Those with a diagnosis of migraine need to be aware of how their lifestyle may directly affect the frequency and severity of their headache. Controlling triggers may provide substantial benefit. It has been identified that as patients get older, there may be a decrease in the frequency of this type of headache and they may disappear after a number of years.' "
Can migraines be prevented or the frequency of migraines be reduced?,"'If you are susceptible to migraines, you will always have some component of risk, but daily use of medications and avoiding triggers often are effective in preventing them.' "

Cluster headaches are less common than migraine.''Tension headaches are a more common cause of headache. These occur due to contraction of the muscles of the ''scalp'', face, and neck.' "
What is migraine with aura?,"'In some cases, people with migraines have specific warning symptoms, or an aura, prior to the onset of their headache. These warning signs can range from flashing lights or a blind spot in one eye to numbness or weakness involving one side of the body. The ''migraine aura'' may last for several minutes, and then resolves as the head pain begins or may last until the headache resolves. For patients who have never had an aura, it can be frightening and can mimic the symptoms of a ''stroke''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of migraine headaches?,"'The most common ''symptoms of migraine'' are:''The International Headache Society defines ''episodic migraine'' as being unilateral (meaning on one side of the head), pulsing discomfort of moderate-to-severe intensity, which is aggravated by physical activity and associated with nausea and/or vomiting as well as ''photophobia'' and/or phonophobia (sensitivity to light and sound).''A ''tension headache'' is described as being bilateral and the pain is not pulsating, but feels like pressure or tightness. While severity can be mild-to-moderate, the headache is not disabling and there is no worsening of the pain with routine physical activity; additionally, there is no associated nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia.''A migraine headache typically lasts for several hours up to several days.'

   Severe, often ""pounding,"" pain, usually on one side of the head Nausea and/or vomiting Sensitivity to light Sensitivity to sound Eye pain Many people describe their headache as a one-sided, pounding type of pain, with nausea and sensitivity to light, sound, or smells (known as photophobia, phonophobia, and osmophobia). In some cases, the discomfort may be bilateral (both sides of the head). The pain of a migraine is often graded as moderate to severe in intensity. Physical activity or exertion (walking upstairs, rushing to catch a bus or train) will worsen the symptoms. Up to one-third of people with migraines have an aura, or a specific neurologic symptom, before their headache begins. Frequently, the aura is a visual disturbance described as a temporary blindness that obscures part of the visual field. Some describe flashing lights in one or both eyes, sometimes surrounding a blind spot. Other symptoms, including numbness or weakness along one side, or speech disturbances, occur rarely. Some people describe visual symptoms of loss of vision, which lasts for less than an hour, and may or may not be associated with head pain once the vision returns, as an ocular migraine. This is also known as retinal migraine, and may be associated with symptoms similar to those described as an aura, such as blind spots, complete loss of vision in one eye, or flashing lights. Patients who experience these symptoms regularly need evaluation to exclude a primary retinal problem. Eye pain, which is different from sensitivity to light, is not a common component of migraine. If eye pain is persistent, or if eye pain is present and accompanied by blurred vision or loss of vision, then seek prompt evaluation."
What causes migraine headaches?,"'The specific cause of migraines is not known, but there may be fluctuations in certain neurotransmitters, chemicals that send messages between brain cells. These changes may predispose some people to develop migraine headaches.'  "
What foods and other things trigger migraines?,"'Many factors have been identified as ''migraine triggers''.''Changes in barometric pressure have been described as leading to migraine headaches.''Not every individual who has migraine attacks will experience one when exposed to these triggers. If a person is unsure what specific triggers might cause a migraine, maintaining a headache diary can be beneficial to identify those individual factors that lead to migraine.'   Normal hormone fluctuations, which occur with regular menstrual cycles, and some types of oral contraceptives (birth control pills) Various foods such as:Red winesAged cheesesPreservatives used in smoked meats (nitrates)Monosodium glutamateArtificial sweetenersChocolateDairy productsAlcoholic beverages Red wines Aged cheeses Preservatives used in smoked meats (nitrates) Monosodium glutamate Artificial sweeteners Chocolate Dairy products Alcoholic beverages Stress Oversleeping Exposure to strong stimuli such as bright lights, loud noises, or strong smells"
How can you tell if it is a migraine or a different type of headache?,"'No specific physical findings are found when patients are experiencing a routine migraine headache. If an abnormality is identified on physical examination, there should be suspicion of other possible causes for the headache.''According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3 (ICHD) criteria for migraine without aura, a patient must have had at least five headache attacks fulfilling the following criteria:''Imaging the brain with an ''MRI'' and ''CT scans'' or performing a brain wave test (''electroencephalogram'' [''EEG'""]) is not necessary if the patient's physical examination is normal."" Headache attacks lasting 4 to 72 hours (untreated or unsuccessfully treated) The headache has at least two of the following characteristics:Unilateral locationPulsating qualityModerate or severe pain intensityAggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity (for example, walking or climbing stairs) Unilateral location Pulsating quality Moderate or severe pain intensity Aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity (for example, walking or climbing stairs) During the headache, at least one of the following characteristics:Nausea and/or vomitingPhotophobia and/or phonophobia Nausea and/or vomiting Photophobia and/or phonophobia The headache cannot be attributed to another disorder."
What are the treatments guidelines for migraine headaches?,"'Migraine headache treatment can vary due to several factors. Usually, the treatment for migraines depends upon how frequently they occur, the type of medicine prescribed to prevent triggers and attacks or provide pain relief, and how long they last.'

  "
Medications for acute and chronic migraines,"'The treatment of an ''acute migraine headache ''may vary from over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, like ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'' and others), ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'', etc.), ''naproxen'' sodium (''Aleve'') to prescription medications.' Triptans (sumatriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, almotriptan, and frovatriptan), may be extremely effective in treating migraines and may be prescribed to help patients treat their migraines at home. A combination of naproxen and sumatriptan is now available. Additionally, sumatriptan is now available as a patch, which delivers the medication though the skin. Not every patient can take these medications, and there are specific limitations regarding how often these medications can be used. Other medication regimens may also be used to control migraine headache. Some medications are appropriate for home use and others require a visit to the doctor's office or emergency department. Dihydroergotamine (DHE 45) can be administered intravenously or by nasal spray; this medication cannot be used if a triptan has been used within the preceding 24 hours. Diclofenac potassium for oral solution (Cambia) is a potent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication approved for treatment of migraine. Antiemetic medications, including intravenous (IV) metoclopramide, and IV or intramuscular (IM) chlorpromazine and prochlorperazine can be used both to relieve nausea and vomiting and to rid migraine pain."
Narcotics for pain,"'Narcotic pain medications are not necessarily appropriate for the treatment of migraine headaches and are associated with the phenomenon of rebound headache, where the headache returns -- sometimes more intensely -- when the narcotics wear off. In all cases of migraine, the use of acute pain therapies must be watched closely so that a patient does not develop medication overuse headache.''Too frequent use of many of the medications used to treat migraine headache can lead to increased headache occurrence, or even daily headaches. This type of headache phenomenon is known as medication overuse headache.' "
Migraine prevention medications,"'If an individual experiences frequent headaches, or if the headaches routinely last for several days, then preventive medications may be indicated. These may be prescribed on a daily basis in an effort to decrease the frequency, severity, and duration of migraine headaches. There are many different medications which have been shown to be effective in this role, including:''The specific migraine headache treatment that is selected for a patient is dependent on many other factors, including age, sex, blood pressure, and other pre-existing medical conditions.''Other patients may find that use of one of the new calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists, including erenumab (Aimovig), fremanezumab (Ajovy), or galcanezumab (Emgality) is beneficial to decrease their migraine frequency. These medications are injected monthly or quarterly (every 3 months) to treat migraine.' blood pressure medications, for example, propranolol (Inderal), nadolol (Corgard), verapamil (Clan, Covera, Isoptin, Verelan), and flunarizine), anti-seizure medications, for example, divalproex sodium (Depakote and others), topiramate (Topamax), and gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise), antidepressant medications (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and venlafaxine) and other supplements (magnesium, butterbur, and riboflavin)."
What natural home remedies and lifestyle changes relieve migraines?,"'Migraine patients can play a significant role in managing their headache frequency and severity.''Keep track of when migraines occur by using a headache diary or log to track pain levels, triggers, and symptoms. In addition, patients should keep track of the migraine types they experience (an individual can experience more than one type of migraine). This can help identify patterns that precede a migraine, as well as help identify factors that contribute to the development of the headache. Once these contributing factors are known, lifestyle modifications can lessen their impact. These modifications may include:''Some people find that exercises that promote muscle relaxation can help manage the pain of migraines. Examples of types of mind-body exercises that can help encourage relaxation are:''There is no specific ''diet'' for people with migraines that will help relieve symptoms. However, certain foods can be triggers for migraines in susceptible people. These foods include:''Understanding the particular triggers of your migraines and avoiding them may help some sufferers decrease the frequency of attacks.'   Maintain a regular schedule for eating and sleeping.Avoid certain foods that might cause a migraine.Keep well hydrated since dehydration has been identified as a migraine trigger for some people.Exercise regularly. Avoid certain foods that might cause a migraine. Keep well hydrated since dehydration has been identified as a migraine trigger for some people. Exercise regularly. Relaxation strategies and meditation also have been recognized as effective strategies to prevent migraines and decrease their severity. Meditation Progressive muscle relaxation Guided imagery Yoga Red wines Aged cheeses Preservatives used in smoked meats (nitrates) Monosodium glutamate Artificial sweeteners Chocolate Alcoholic beverages Dairy products"
What is the treatment for migraines during pregnancy? Can you take medication?,"'Many women find their headaches stabilize or even resolve during ''pregnancy''. This may be related to more consistent hormone levels that occur during pregnancy. To decrease the risk of ''birth defects'', certain medications used to prevent migraines may need to be discontinued prior to a pregnancy.''There are limited studies of drugs used to treat migraines during pregnancy. Acetaminophen is relatively safe when used in recommended doses. If a you are ''pregnant'' and are experiencing frequent headaches, your doctor or other health care professional may provide treatment alternatives. Many migraine medicines, including the triptans, are not well studied in pregnancy, so the doctor needs to weigh the potential benefits to the patient against the risks to the fetus before prescribing these medications.' "
What is the treatment for migraines in children?,"'Migraines may occur in children. Treatment is similar to the treatment of migraines in adults, but drug dosages may need to be adjusted because of the smaller size of the patients.' Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are often effective in controlling acute headaches. For more severe or refractory headaches, some of the triptans have been identified as being beneficial. If headaches occur frequently, daily medication may be needed for prevention. Diet, regular sleep patterns, routine exercise, and biofeedback, are all potentially beneficial in decreasing the frequency and severity of migraines in children. The use of a headache diary is a helpful tool to identify and avoid migraine triggers."
What is the prognosis for a person with migraines? Is there a cure?,"'Most people who have migraines find that their headaches may be controlled with the preventive medications and lifestyle changes. Those with a diagnosis of migraine need to be aware of how their lifestyle may directly affect the frequency and severity of their headache. Controlling triggers may provide substantial benefit. It has been identified that as patients get older, there may be a decrease in the frequency of this type of headache and they may disappear after a number of years.' "
Can migraines be prevented or the frequency of migraines be reduced?,"'If you are susceptible to migraines, you will always have some component of risk, but daily use of medications and avoiding triggers often are effective in preventing them.' "
What is abdominal migraine?,"'Like adults, children can develop migraines. This can be the same type of condition seen in adults, which is typically occurs with a ''headache'', and is sometimes preceded by an aura. ''Nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''photophobia'' (decreased tolerance to light) can occur. Children also develop some unusual and atypical variations of migraine, not associated with ''headaches'' in particular, that are not usually observed in adults. Abdominal migraine is one of these variants. ''Abdominal migraine is a condition thought to be related to migraine that is characterized by pain in the abdomen. It is often precipitated by the usual triggers of classic migraine. The pain can be severe, and nausea and vomiting can occur. ''Abdominal migraine is rare in adults, but it has been estimated that up to 2% of all children may develop abdominal migraines. Children who have the condition usually go on to develop migraine ''headaches'' as adults. Girls are affected more frequently than boys. Abdominal migraine typically occurs for the first time between the ages of 2 and 10.'  "
What causes abdominal migraine?,"'The cause of abdominal migraine is poorly understood. Abdominal migraine is thought by some researchers to be related to neurologic or endocrinologic changes and may be caused by alterations in the levels of ''serotonin'' and histamine in the body. Genetic factors may also be involved as the condition is more common in children who have a family history of migraine. About 60% of children with the condition have a positive family history for migraine. ''Triggers for abdominal migraine have been described, similar to triggers for classic migraine. These include ''chocolate'' or nitrite-containing foods, ''stress'', and ''anxiety''.' "
What are the symptoms of abdominal migraine?,"'As mentioned, abdominal migraine causes pain in the abdomen that can be severe and debilitating. It is typically located in the middle portion of the belly, often around the umbilicus. Cramping, nausea, and vomiting can accompany the pain. Pallor (paleness) of the skin is often observed. There may not be associated ''headache''. The symptoms are usually relieved by ''sleep'' and can last anywhere from one hour to several days.' "
How is abdominal migraine diagnosed?,"'Because of the frequent absence of ''headache'', the condition can be difficult to diagnose, especially during the first episode. There is no specific test that can establish the diagnosis of abdominal migraine, so the diagnosis is based on exclusion of other conditions. Laboratory tests and imaging studies are usually directed to rule out other conditions that could be responsible for the symptoms. Electroencephalography (''EEG'') is sometimes done to rule out a''seizure'' disorder as the cause of the symptoms.' "
What is the treatment for abdominal migraine?,"'The treatment of abdominal migraine has two components - to reduce symptoms of an acute attack and to prevent or lessen the severity of future episodes. Research to date has not provided sufficient data to firmly establish the role of any particular medication in either treating symptoms or preventing future episodes of abdominal migraine. Still, many patients respond to anti-migraine medications and other medications.' "
Medications to treat abdominal migraine,"'Types of medications that may be used to manage abdominal migraine include:''Other aspects of treatment may include the administration of intravenous fluids if vomiting is severe, and the use of sedatives or antiemetic drugs.''Treatment may also include advice to recognize and avoid triggers, if these are known. For example, if food triggers have been identified, these should be avoided, although not all those who experience abdominal migraine have identifiable food triggers. ''Stress management'' and relaxation programs may be of benefit to some.' Analgesic drugs, such as nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) or
	acetaminophen Sumatriptan 
	(Imitrex, Alsuma), a member of the triptan 
class of drugs used to treat migraine in adults, has been used to treat some 
older children with abdominal migraine 
Tricyclic antidepressants and drugs 
that block the effects of serotonin have been used in some patients to decrease 
frequency of attacks. Valproic acid (Depakote), an 
antiseizure medication, has been used to treat abdominal migraine. Ergotamine medications, also used for 
adults with migraine, are used to treat some childhood variants of migraine. Low dose aspirin and 
	low dose 
beta-blocker medications have been used over the long term in some patients in 
an attempt to diminish the frequency of future attacks. The antihistamine cyproheptadine has 
been shown to be effective in some children with migraine variants."
What is the prognosis for abdominal migraine?,"'The prognosis for abdominal migraine is good; most children eventually stop having the attacks of ''abdominal pain''. However, most children (about 70% in one study of 54 children) who have abdominal migraine go on to develop migraines in adulthood.' "
"Migraine and seizure definitions, auras, symptoms, and signs","   A migraine is a collection of neurological symptoms that usually includes a severe and throbbing headache. A seizure is a change in the brain’s electrical activity that may affect how a person acts or what they do for a short period. The most common seizure disorder is epilepsy. Migraine aura and seizure aura are both chronic neurological events that have some similar symptoms including:Visual auraIrritabilityNauseaVomitingSensitivity to light and sound Visual aura Irritability Nausea Vomiting Sensitivity to light and sound Migraine aura symptoms that do not occur with seizures also may include:TalkativenessAppetite changesWater retentionSleep disturbancesDizzinessNumbness or tingling in the extremities or face. Talkativeness Appetite changes Water retention Sleep disturbances Dizziness Numbness or tingling in the extremities or face. Symptoms of seizure aura that do not occur with migraine aura also may include a feeling of heaviness, depression, and an impending feeling of a seizure coming on. In general, migraines do not cause seizures and seizures do not cause migraines, however, many of the symptoms that occur before a migraine are similar to symptoms experienced before a seizure. People who have migraines are twice as likely to have seizures, and vice-versa. Migraine treatment includes medications, lifestyle changes, and alternative treatments. Seizure treatment includes medication, surgery, vagus nerve stimulation, and dietary therapy."
What is a migraine?,"'A migraine is a type of ''headache'' with symptoms like a severe and throbbing ''headache'' on one side of the head accompanied by ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''dizziness'', visual disturbances, numbness or tingling in the extremities or face, ''sensitivity to light'' and sound, touch and smell.''Some people with ''migraines'' experience an aura before the head ''pain'' starts. Migraine aura symptoms include visual disturbances ''ocular'' migraine), water retention, problems sleeping, appetite changes, and irritability.' "
What is migralepsy?,"'Migralepsy is an outdated term that comes from putting together the words “migraine” and “''epilepsy''.” Misdiagnosis between migraine and ''epilepsy'' is common because ''headaches'' that often accompany seizures (ictal ''headaches'') can be similar to a migraine with aura.''Currently, researchers and doctors do not recognize “migralepsy” as a medical condition, but rather, an ''epilepsy''-migraine sequence (and less likely, a migraine-''epilepsy'' sequence).' "
What is an ictal headache?,"'An ictal ''headache'' is a rare type of ''headache'' in people with ''epilepsy''. An ictal ''headache'' has the same pounding, throbbing feeling as a typical migraine, but usually is caused by seizure activity.' "
What is a seizure?,"'A seizure is a change in the brain’s electrical activity. Chemical changes that occur in nerve cells may cause too much or too little activity in parts of the brain, which can lead to electrical surges in the brain that cause seizures. Seizures usually affect how a person acts or what they do for a short period. A seizure can range from being mild and barely noticeable to being completely incapacitating. A seizure may also cause a lapse in awareness, called an ''absence seizure''. ''Nonepileptic seizures'' (also called nonepileptic events) look like seizures, but are not caused by electrical brain activity as in epilepsy.''A seizure is not an illness; it is a symptom of a disorder that affects the brain. The most common seizure disorder is ''epilepsy''.''Nonepileptic seizures'' (also called nonepileptic events) look like seizures, but are not caused by electrical brain activity as in epilepsy.' "
Which migraine and seizure symptoms and auras are the same?,'Migraine aura and seizure aura have similar symptoms such as:' Visual aura Irritability Nausea/vomiting Sensitivity to light and sound
Which migraine and seizure symptoms and auras are different? How long do they last?,"'Key differences between migraine aura and seizure aura include:''Pre-aura prodrome is more common in people with migraines than in people with seizures. Following a migraine aura, a ''migraine headache'' can last from 4 to 72 hours. An atypical migraine, also called a common migraine or migraine without aura, is not preceded by an aura.''Following a seizure aura, the seizure occurs and the post ictal ''headache'' is brief.'   Talkativeness Appetite changes Water retention Sleep disturbances Feeling of heaviness Depression Impending feeling of a seizure coming on"
Can seizures cause migraines?,'Seizures usually do not cause migraines. Migraine ''headaches'' and seizures share many similar symptoms and often a person with one disorder will experience the other. Seizure auras have many of the same symptoms as migraine auras. Many people who suffer seizures have severe ''headaches'' after their seizures because they are misdiagnosed as migraines.' 
Can migraines cause seizures? What is an ictal headache?,"'In general, migraines do not cause seizures. Migraines and seizures are two different neurologic problems that have overlapping symptoms. Many of the symptoms that occur before a migraine are similar to symptoms experienced before a seizure. However, people who have migraines are twice as likely to have seizures, and vice-versa. The cause of this relationship is not understood, but there is a clear correlation between the two disorders.In some children, ''headaches'' are the only symptom of seizures and they may be misdiagnosed as migraines.' "
What is the treatment for migraines vs. seizures?,"   Medications for acute migraine treatment include over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and acetaminophen (Tylenol); and prescription medications such as triptans, ergot derivatives and narcotic pain medications. Medications to prevent a migraine attack include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and hormone therapy (in women whose migraines are linked to their menstrual cycle). Erenumab (Aimovig) is a monthly injection used to prevent migraine headaches. Erenumab is the first drug in a new class of drugs called a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (CGRP-R) antagonists. Erenumab was approved by the FDA in 2018. Lifestyle changes for migraine headaches and triggers:Avoid known migraine triggersMaintain a healthy balanced dietGet regular exerciseLimit caffeine and alcoholUse stress reduction techniques such as Yoga and meditation. Avoid known migraine triggers Maintain a healthy balanced diet Get regular exercise Limit caffeine and alcohol Use stress reduction techniques such as Yoga and meditation. Biofeedback, acupuncture, and counseling may also help. Medication: anticonvulsants, sedatives, medicines for nerve pain Surgery: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LiTT) is a minimally invasive surgery used in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy whose seizures do not respond to medication. The procedure uses heat to remove the part of the brain where the seizures originate. Focal resection: This surgery removes the portion of the brain where seizures begin, and is effective only when seizures originate reliably from a single location in the brain. Hemispherectomy: This procedure involves removal of almost all of one side of the brain. This is only used in a small number of individuals. Corpus callosotomy surgery: Unlike the other procedures, this does not remove the sections of the brain where seizures originate. This procedure cuts off the brain’s electrical communication between hemispheres, interrupting the seizure activity. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS): this involves stimulation of the vagus nerve by placing a pacemaker device in the chest. Dietary therapy: ketogenic diet (high fat, low carbohydrate)"
Facts you should know about migraines and strokes," A migraine headache is a type of headache that causes severe, intense, and throbbing pain on one side of the head. A migraine “aura” describes visual, sensory, speech, motor, or other central nervous system symptoms that precede a migraine headache. A stroke or ""brain attack"" occurs when a blood vessel in the brain is blocked, leaks, or bursts, which deprives brain cells of oxygen and they begin to die. The part of the body controlled by the damaged area of the brain loses function. There are three types of strokes, transient ischemic attack (TIA, mini-stroke), ischemic, and hemorrhagic. The most common type of stroke is an ischemic stroke. A migraine aura may resemble a transient ischemic attack (TIA, mini-stroke), and a headache that seems similar to a migraine may occur during a stroke. Stroke and migraine symptoms that may be similar include:Severe headacheFacial numbnessNumbness in the extremities or faceDizziness Severe headache Facial numbness Numbness in the extremities or face Dizziness A main difference between the symptoms of migraine and stroke is that stroke symptoms come on suddenly while migraine symptoms tend to come on gradually. Stroke symptoms that are different from migraine include:Face droopingUneven or lopsided smileDifficulty speaking or slurred speechSudden confusion or difficulty understanding speechSudden trouble seeing in one or both eyesSudden loss of balance or coordination, or trouble walking Face drooping Uneven or lopsided smile Difficulty speaking or slurred speech Sudden confusion or difficulty understanding speech Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Sudden loss of balance or coordination, or trouble walking Migraine symptoms that are different from stroke include:Visual disturbancesNausea or vomitingExtreme sensitivity to sound/light/touch/smellTingling in the extremities Visual disturbances Nausea or vomiting Extreme sensitivity to sound/light/touch/smell Tingling in the extremities Stroke is a medical emergency. Immediate medical attention is necessary. Know the signs of a stroke and act FAST. FAST: Facial drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulties, Time to call 9-1-1 Migraine headaches can last between 4 to 72 hours and can be incapacitating. In a very small population of people who suffer from migraines with specific symptoms, migraines may be related to a higher risk of stroke. The specific type of migraine associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke is migraine with aura, a type of migraine that affects about one-quarter of all people with migraine headaches. The cause of migraine headaches is not completely understood, but it is believed to be due to abnormal increases in levels of substances naturally produced in the brain, which causes inflammation. This inflammation causes blood vessels in the brain to swell and press on nearby nerves resulting in migraine symptoms. There may also be a genetic link to migraine headaches. On a day-to-day basis, “triggers,” or factors that contribute to a migraine headache may cause migraines. There is no cure for migraine headaches, but they can be managed with medications, lifestyle changes, and alternative treatments. Blood thinners are the most common treatment for acute ischemic stroke. The “clot buster” drug used in emergency settings is called alteplase (Activase), also referred to as tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) must be administered within 3-4.5 hours (depending on the circumstance) of the onset of stroke symptoms for the best chance of recovery. Ischemic strokes also can be treated with intra-arterial blood thinners or clot retrieval devices. Hemorrhagic strokes may require surgical removal of the blood clot, aneurysm clipping, coil embolization, or surgical arteriovenous malformation (AVM) repair along with stopping ant blood thinners."
What is a migraine headache?,"'A migraine is a group of neurological symptoms that typically include a severe throbbing ''headache'', usually on one side of the head. Researchers and doctors do fully understand the causes of migraine ''headaches''; however, most think that they may be caused by changes in the chemicals in the brain, which causes inflammation, or the condition may be genetic (''inherited'').'

What is a stroke?,"'A stroke or ""brain attack"" occurs when a blood vessel in the brain is blocked, leaks, or bursts. This deprives brain cells of oxygen and they begin to die. The part of the body controlled by the damaged area of the brain loses function. A small stroke may only cause minor problems or temporary weakness or ''memory loss''. A larger stroke can cause permanent ''paralysis'' or loss of ability to speak or in some individuals, death.''There are two main types of stroke:' Hemorrhagic stroke happens when a blood vessel leaks or bursts and there is bleeding into the brain tissue. Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel is blocked by a blood clot in the brain.A “mini-stroke” (transient ischemic attack, TIA) is a type of ischemic stroke in which there is only temporary blockage of a blood vessel in the brain. Mini-stroke symptoms and signs only last a few minutes; however, it is still a medical emergency and 911 should be called.

Can the symptoms and signs of a migraine mimic those of a stroke?,"'It is possible for a ''headache'' that feels like a migraine to occur during a stroke. A migraine aura may resemble a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a “mini-stroke” (a temporary stroke that resolves symptoms quickly without residual or long-term disability).''Migraine attacks can last between 4 to 72 hours and can be incapacitating. Migraine is more than other types of ''headaches''.

Can migraines cause a stroke?,"'Migraine and stroke may occur at the same time, but a causal link has not been established. When an ischemic stroke occurs during a migraine attack, it is called a migrainous infarction.''In a very small population of patients with specific symptoms, ''migraines'' may be related to a higher risk of stroke. Migraines may be a risk factor for stroke, in that strokes occur more frequently in people who have had migraines, but the strokes do not necessarily occur during migraine attacks. The specific type of migraine associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke is migraine with aura, a type of migraine that affects about one-quarter of all migraine patients. Moreover, women who have migraine with aura are at a greater risk for stroke than women without migraine, or even men who experience migraine with aura.''People with migraines at highest risk for stroke are those who also have traditional risk factors for stroke such as ''high blood pressure'', ''diabetes'', ''high cholesterol'', ''smoking'', and ''obesity''.' "
What triggers or causes migraines and strokes?,"'The cause of migraines is not completely understood, but it is believed to be due to abnormal increases in levels of substances naturally produced in the brain, which produce inflammation that causes blood vessels in the brain to swell and press on nearby nerves resulting in migraine symptoms. There may also be a genetic link to migraines.''On a day-to-day basis, ''migraine triggers'' or factors (environmental, chemical and many others) contribute to a migraine attack, but are not triggers for stokes.''Common ''migraine triggers'' include:''A blood vessel in the brain is blocked, leaks, or bursts causes a stroke.

What are the treatments for migraines and strokes?,"'There is no cure for migraine, but the headaches can be managed with:''Stroke is a medical emergency. If you have stroke symptoms, call 9-1-1 and get medical attention immediately.''It is important to ''CT scan'' the patient’s brain to diagnose an ischemic stroke from a hemorrhagic stroke because the emergent treatments are very different.''Blood thinners are the most common treatment for acute ischemic stroke. The “clot buster” drug used in emergency settings is called alteplase (''Activase''), also referred to as tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) and it must be administered within 3-4.5 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms (depending on the circumstance) for the best chance of recovery. Patients who cannot receive tPA may receive blood thinners such as ''aspirin'' and clopidogrel. Some stroke patients also may need, or benefit from, intra-arterial blood thinners or clot retrieval devices.''Patients with ''carotid artery disease'' may get a carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery ''angioplasty'' to open blocked carotid arteries.''Hemorrhagic strokes may be treated by taking patients off antiplatelet medicines and blood thinners to reduce bleeding. Patients with ''high blood pressure'' may receive antihypertensive ''drugs'' to lower ''blood pressure''. Surgery such as ''aneurysm'' clipping, coil embolization, or ''arteriovenous malformation'' (AVM) repair may be needed to treat hemorrhagic stroke.' Medications for acute treatment include over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin); triptans; and ergot derivatives Medications to prevent an attack include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and hormone therapy (in women whose migraines are linked to their menstrual cycle). Lifestyle changes include avoiding known migraine triggers, maintaining a healthy balanced diet, regular exercise, limiting caffeine and alcohol, and stress reduction techniques. Biofeedback, acupuncture, and counseling may also help."
Migraine vs. headache pain similarities and differences,"'The ''pain'' of ''migraine'' and ''tension headache'' are similar and tend to be mild, moderate, or severe in nature. The ''pain'' for each type of ''headache'' may be located on one side of the head or on both sides of the head.''The differences between the pain of ''migraine'' and ''headache'' are that migraine pain has a throbbing quality, and many people report even slight physical exertion (such as ''walking'' up a flight of stairs) may worsen their pain.''In contrast, the pain associated with tension-type ''headaches'' tends to be more chronic and steady. Many people with tension ''headache'' describe a band-like tightness or pressure.''If your are experiencing a ''headache'' very different in quality or severity (the worst headache of your life) than your usual ''headaches'', or which is associated with unusual symptoms, or is associated with an elevated temperature, you need medical evaluation immediately to exclude serious underlying causes.' "
Migraine or a another type of headache,"'Headaches'' are one of the most common health problems doctors and other health care professionals treat. Although many people describe all moderate to severe ''headaches'' as “''migraine'',” there are specific criteria used to identify ''migraine'', tension, and other less-common ''headache'' varieties. Doctors and other health professionals consider most ''headaches'' painful, annoying, or even transiently debilitating to a patient, but they cause little risk.''Migraine ''headaches'' tend to have some marked differences from other ''headaches'', which helps your doctor determine which type of headache you have. There are also several different types of migraine headaches. Migraine with aura and migraine without aura are the most common. An aura is a neurological symptom such as vision changes, numbness, tingling, or even difficulty speaking which precedes the onset of the headache.''Although many people believe that any moderate to severe headache is a migraine, there are specific criteria regarding the type of pain and associated symptoms, which lead to the diagnosis of migraine.'   Tension headache, also known as tension-type headache, is the most common form of headache. Most people have experienced a tension headache at some point in their lives. Migraine headache or migraine pain is also common, but occurs far less frequently than tension headache. The pain associated with migraine headache is different from tension-type headache and can help determine which type of headache a person is experiencing. Cluster headache, chronic daily headache, and medication overuse headache occur much less frequently than tension and migraine headache."
Symptoms and signs that are similar and different between migraine vs. headache,"'The only similarity between a migraine and a headache are that both cause pain. The headache may come on gradually or suddenly.''Migraine is different from other headaches because it may cause symptoms including:''These symptoms are often considered to be an acute migraine attack.''Tension-type headaches may be associated with tenderness of the muscles of the head, neck, and shoulders. If you have this type of headache, you do not have a change in pain with physical activity, and there are no associated sensitivities to light, sounds, or smells.'  Nausea or vomiting Sensitivity to light, sound, or smells Worsening of the headache with slight physical exertion"
Differences in causes between migraine vs. headache,"'Doctors believe the underlying cause of ''migraines'' is related to changes in the blood flow in certain areas of the brain, with subsequent alterations in the blood vessels in that region. Chemical reactions may lead to swelling and irritation of the blood vessels (thought to contribute to the characteristic “throbbing” quality of a migraine headache).''The specific cause of tension-type headache is unknown. Doctors believed at one time that chronic muscle tension was the underlying factor, but there now appears to be a more complicated combination of factors that are involved.' "
Difference between triggers for migraine vs. headache,"'Certain factors are common ''migraine triggers'', including:''The cause of tension-type headache tends to be related to ''stress'' and associated tightness or tension in the muscles of the neck or ''scalp''.'   Foods like red wine, chocolate, peanut butter, dairy products, and citrus fruits. Hormonal swings associated with menstrual cycles or pregnancy. Weather changes Certain smells Lack of sleep Gluten can be a migraine trigger for people who have true celiac disease. If you are concerned about this issue, eliminate gluten from your diet for a test period and keep a log for a possible trigger."
Migraine vs. headache diagnosis,"'Although there are no specific tests for migraine headaches, your doctor may order tests to exclude other conditions or problems that are triggering your headaches. This may include blood work or different brain imaging, such as CAT scan or ''MRI''. In rare cases, your doctor may order a ''spinal tap'' to exclude causes of more serious, severe headaches.''A doctor who is experienced in treating various headaches can help differentiate the type of headaches that you have. A ''sinus headache'' (caused by ''sinus infection'' or ''allergic rhinitis'') often mimics some signs and symptoms of ''migraines''.''Monitoring the duration of your headache can provide important information that can help diagnosis the type of headache you are experiencing. Migraine headaches may last a few hours to three days, while tension headaches may last only 30 minutes or linger for up to a week.' Keep a headache diary to help identify triggers that lead up to the onset of the headache, for example, menstrual cycles for women, hormone treatments, and alcohol intake. Keep track of when a headache begins, the severity of the pain, any associated symptoms, how long the headache lasts, and any medications that you have taken. If there does not seem to be any clearly identifiable cause for your headaches, maintain a diet diary, and keep track of any foods or drinks that you may have consumed the day before a headache to identify possible triggers."
Differences and similarities between treatments of migraine vs. headache,"'Treatment of ''migraines'' often focus on reversing the inflammatory changes of the blood vessels thought to be the source of the migraine pain.''Triptans are a class of ''drugs'' effective at helping reduce inflammation and decrease the swelling of the inflamed vessel, which tends to lead to decreased head pain in a relatively short time. Many of these medications also can reduce the associated ''nausea'', light-, and sound - sensitivity that occur with ''migraines''. Examples of triptans include ''sumatriptan'' (''Imitrex'', and Sumavel DosePro), ''eletriptan'' (''Relpax''), ''zolmitriptan'' (''Zomig''), and ''rizatriptan'' (''Maxalt''). These ''drugs'' are available as a pill, nasal spray, or injection.''Botox''. If you have chronic migraines (defined as migraine headache occurring more than 4 hours in one day and more than 15 days for 1 consecutive month), ''Botox''® (botulinum toxin) may help you to decrease the frequency and severity of your migraines. This treatment has not been shown to be of benefit in treating other types of frequent headache.''Erenumab (Aimovig) ''is a new class of drug called a ''calcitonin'' gene-related peptide receptor (CGRP-R) antagonist approved in 2018 for the preventative treatment of migraine. It is a monthly injection used to prevent migraines.' "
Foods help decrease the frequency of migraines,"'Some people with frequent migraines find that avoiding eating certain trigger foods can help alleviate some of their headaches. For others, consuming products high in magnesium, riboflavin, and ''omega-3 fatty acids'' (spinach, whole grain or enriched breads, almonds, salmon) helps decrease some migraine frequency.' "
Home remedies and essential oils that help migraine and headache pain,"'Essential oils are a home remedy used to treat migraines and other types of headaches. Some people benefit by using lavender oil and ''peppermint oil'' as aromatherapy. You can even apply the oils to your scalp. Other home remedies include basil oil, ''feverfew'', , buckwheat, and ''flaxseed''. Consult your doctor before using any home remedies.' "
Can migraines and headaches be cured?,"'Migraine headache and tension-type headaches can occur frequently, even daily. If you have a headache for at least 15 days each month, your doctor or other medical healthcare professional may recommend daily medication. These may include:''Patients who experience migraine headache often will respond extremely well to therapeutic intervention, and their ultimate prognosis (which is good) is no different from patients who experience other types of headache.''Although it may be tempting to treat headaches at home, repeated or recurrent use of medication can lead to a condition known as Medication Overuse Headache, a condition in which headaches occur near daily.''If you are experiencing frequent headache or head pain, it is important to seek appropriate evaluation and treatment. Doctors trained in identifying different types of headaches, for example, internal medicine specialists, neurologists, or allergists, can help diagnose the cause of your headaches.' Antidepressants Anti-seizure medications Certain types of muscles relaxants, depending on the underlying headache. Botox® injections for people with chronic migraine headache."
What is lactose intolerance?,"'Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest and absorb lactose (the ''sugar'' in milk) that results in gastrointestinal symptoms when milk or food products containing milk are consumed. It is due either to a genetically-programmed loss of lactase, the intestinal enzyme responsible for the digestion of lactose, or diseases affecting the small intestine that destroy lactase. Genetically programmed loss of lactase occurs between early childhood and age 21. The timing of this loss is determined primarily by ethnicity.''Because diseases of the intestine can occur at any age, lactose intolerance can begin at any age; however, that does not mean that an individual has become genetically lactase deficient.' "
What causes lactose intolerance?,"'Lactose is a sugar molecule that is made up of two smaller sugars, glucose and galactose. In order for lactose to be absorbed from the intestine and into the body, it must first be split into glucose and galactose. The glucose and galactose are then absorbed by the cells lining the small intestine. The enzyme that splits lactose into glucose and galactose is called lactase, and it is located on the surface of the cells lining the small intestine.''Lactose intolerance is caused by reduced or absent activity of lactase that prevents the splitting of lactose (lactase deficiency). Lactase deficiency may occur for one of three reasons, congenital, secondary or developmental.''Lactase deficiency may occur because of a congenital absence (absent from birth) of lactase due to a mutation in the gene that is responsible for producing lactase. This is a very rare cause of lactase deficiency, and the symptoms of this type of lactase deficiency begin shortly after birth.''Another cause of lactase deficiency is secondary lactase deficiency. This type of deficiency is due to diseases that destroy the lining of the small intestine along with the lactase. An example of such a disease is ''celiac disease'' (sprue).''The most common cause of lactase deficiency is a decrease in the amount of lactase that occurs after childhood and persists into adulthood, referred to as adult-type hypolactasia. This decrease in lactase is genetically programmed. Lactase deficiency (and lactose intolerance) is most common among Asians, affecting more than 90% of adults in some communities. People with ancestry from Northern Europe, on the other hand, have a 5% rate of lactase deficiency. In addition to variability in the prevalence of lactase deficiency among ethnic groups, there also is variability in the age at which symptoms of lactase deficiency (and lactose intolerance) appear.''As people age they may develop lactose intolerance; however, the extent of the intolerance appears to be mild and not associated with clinical symptoms.\xa0 Therefore, the development of lactose intolerance in the elderly should not be made lightly.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of lactose intolerance?,"'The common primary symptoms of lactose intolerance are gastrointestinal and include:''Less common symptoms of lactose intolerance include:''Constipation'' is not a sign of lactose intolerance.''Unfortunately, these symptoms can be caused by several gastrointestinal conditions or diseases, so the presence of these symptoms is not very good at predicting whether a person has lactase deficiency or lactose intolerance.''Symptoms occur because the unabsorbed lactose passes through the small intestine and into the colon. In the colon, one type of normal bacterium contains lactase and is able to split the lactose and use the resulting glucose and galactose for its own purposes. Unfortunately, when they use the glucose and galactose, these bacteria also release hydrogen gas. Some of the gas is absorbed from the colon and into the body and is then expelled by the ''lungs'' in the breath. Most of the hydrogen, however, is used up in the colon by other bacteria. A small proportion of the hydrogen gas is expelled and is responsible for increased flatulence (passing gas). Some people have an additional type of bacterium in their colons that changes the hydrogen gas into methane gas, and these people will excrete only methane or both hydrogen and methane gas in their breath and flatus.''Not all of the lactose that reaches the colon is split and used by colonic bacteria. The unsplit lactose in the colon draws water into the colon (by osmosis). This leads to loose, diarrheal stools.''The severity of the symptoms of lactose intolerance vary greatly from person to person. One reason for this variability is that people have different amounts of lactose in their ''diet''; the more lactose in the diet, the more likely and severe the symptoms. Another reason for the variability is that people have differing severities of lactase deficiency, that is, they may have mild, moderate, or severe reduction in the amounts of lactase in their ''intestines''. Thus, small amounts of lactose will cause major symptoms in severely lactase deficient people but only mild or no symptoms in mildly lactase deficient people. Finally, people may have different responses to the same amount of lactose reaching the colon. Whereas some may have mild or no symptoms, others may have moderate symptoms. The reason for this is not clear but may relate to differences in their intestinal bacteria.'   abdominal pain, diarrhea, and flatulence (passing gas). abdominal bloating, abdominal distention, and nausea."
What foods have lactose and should be avoided in the diet?,"'Although milk and foods made from milk are the only natural sources of lactose, lactose often is ""hidden"" in prepared foods to which it has been added. People with very low tolerance for lactose should know about the many food products that may contain lactose, even in small amounts. Food products that may contain lactose include:''Smart shoppers learn to read food labels with care, looking not only for milk and lactose in the contents but also for such words as whey, curds, milk by-products, dry milk solids, and nonfat dry milk powder. If any of these are listed on a label, the item contains lactose.' Bread Baked goods Processed breakfast cereals Instant potatoes, soups, and breakfast drinks Margarine Lunch meats (except those that are kosher) Salad dressings Candies Chips and other processed snacks Mixes for pancakes, biscuits, and cookies Soft cheeses Milk Nondairy whipped 
	toppings Nondairy liquid and powered coffee creamers"
What about lactase in medications or drugs?,"'In addition to food sources, lactose can be ""hidden"" in medicines. Lactose is used as the base for many prescription and ''over-the-counter'' medications. Many types of ''birth control pills'', for example, contain lactose, as do some tablets used for stomach acid and gas. However, these products typically affect only people with severe lactose intolerance because they contain such small amounts of lactose.' "
Is there test for lactose deficiency?,"'Although there are several good ways to diagnose lactose intolerance, most people who consider themselves lactose intolerant have never been formally tested for intolerance; approximately 20% of people who think they are lactose intolerant are not lactose intolerant.''Why do people believe that they are lactose intolerant when they are not? This erroneous belief may be common for several reasons. People with unexplained (undiagnosed) gastrointestinal symptoms are looking for an explanation for their symptoms. Since lactose intolerance is a well-known and common condition, it provides these people with a ready (and welcome) explanation for their symptoms. Confirmation that lactose intolerance is present often is made subjectively and without careful correlation between ingestion of milk or milk products and symptoms. Also, there are placebo responses, that is, people think they are better when they are not.''Formal testing for lactose intolerance is valuable. Not only can testing confirm lactose intolerance and prompt the institution of a reduced or lactose-free diet, but it also can exclude lactose intolerance and direct attention to diagnosing other conditions and diseases that are responsible for the symptoms.' "
Elimination diet,"'Probably the most common way that people self-diagnose lactose intolerance is by an elimination diet, a diet that eliminates milk and milk products. There are several problems with this type of ""testing.""''If an elimination diet is to be used for diagnosing lactose intolerance, it should be a rigorous diet. A rigorous diet requires counseling by a dietician or reading a guide to a lactose-elimination diet. The diet also needs to be continued long enough to clearly evaluate whether or not symptoms are better. If there is doubt about improvement on the diet, particularly if symptoms normally fluctuate in intensity over weeks or months, repeated periods of lactose elimination should be tried until a firm conclusion can be drawn. Elimination of all milk products should eliminate symptoms completely if lactose intolerance alone is the cause of the symptoms.'   Milk products are so common in prepared foods from the supermarket or restaurant that it is likely that an elimination diet that is not rigorous (i.e., does not eliminate all milk-containing products) will still include substantial amounts of milk. Thus, persons with severe lactase deficiency attempting an elimination diet may be ingesting enough lactose to have symptoms and erroneously conclude that lactose intolerance is not responsible for the symptoms. People often make the assumption that they are lactose intolerant based on a short trial of elimination. A short trial may be adequate if symptoms are severe and occurring daily, but not if the symptoms are subtle and/or variable. In the latter case, an elimination diet may need to be continued for several weeks. Because symptoms of lactose intolerance are subjective and variable, there always is the possibility of a ""placebo effect"" in which people think they feel better eliminating milk when, in fact, they are no better."
Milk challenge,"'A milk challenge is a simpler way of diagnosing lactose intolerance than an elimination diet. A person fasts overnight and then drinks a glass of milk in the morning. Nothing further is eaten or drunk for 3-5 hours. If a person is lactose intolerant, the milk should produce symptoms within several hours of ingestion. If there are no symptoms or symptoms are substantially milder than the usual symptoms, it is unlikely that lactose intolerance is the cause of the symptoms. It is important that the milk that is used is fat-free in order to eliminate the possibility that fat in the milk is the cause of symptoms. It is not possible to eliminate the possibility that symptoms are due to milk allergy, a very different condition than lactose intolerance; however, this usually is not confusing since allergy to milk is rare and primarily occurs in infants and young children. (If milk allergy is a consideration, pure lactose can be used instead of milk for the challenge.)''An important issue is the amount of milk required for the milk challenge.''Recognition of this issue is important in interpreting the results of a milk challenge.\xa0Also, it is important to remember that lactose intolerance does not mean that there is a genetic lactase deficiency.' If a person drinks several glasses of milk or ingests large amounts of milk-containing products in their normal diet, then a larger amount of milk should be used in the challenge, 8-16 ounces in an adult, equivalent to one or two large glasses of milk. If the person being tested usually does not drink several glasses of milk or ingest larger quantities of milk-containing products, there may be a problem with using 8-16 ounces of milk for testing. These larger quantities of milk used for testing may cause symptoms, but the smaller amounts of milk or milk products that these persons ingest in their normal diet may not be enough to cause symptoms. Technically, they may be lactose intolerant when they are tested with larger amounts of milk, but lactose in their normal diet cannot be responsible for their usual symptoms."
Breath test,"'The ''hydrogen breath test'' is the most convenient and reliable test for lactose intolerance. For the breath test, pure lactose, usually 25 grams (the equivalent of 16 oz. of milk), is ingested with water after an overnight fast. In persons who are lactose intolerant, the lactose that is not digested and absorbed in the small intestine reaches the colon where the bacteria split the lactose into glucose and galactose and produce hydrogen (and/or methane) gas. Small amounts of the hydrogen and methane are absorbed from the colon into the blood and then travel to the lungs where they are excreted in the breath. Samples of breath are collected every 10 or 15 minutes for 3-5 hours after ingestion of the lactose, and the samples are analyzed for hydrogen and/or methane. If hydrogen and/or methane are found in the breath, it means that the small intestine of the person was unable to digest and absorb all of the lactose. He or she is lactose intolerant. The amount of hydrogen or methane excreted in the breath is roughly proportional to the degree of lactose intolerance (and potential lactase deficiency), that is, the larger the amount of hydrogen and/or methane produced, the greater the intolerance or deficiency. The amount of hydrogen and/or methane in the breath, however, is not proportional to the severity of the symptoms. In other words, a person who produces little hydrogen and/or methane may have more severe symptoms than a person who produces a large amount hydrogen and/or methane.'""The breath test is the best test for determining lactose intolerance and potentially lactase deficiency, but it has several weaknesses. The first is that it is a long, boring test. The second is that it suffers from the same issue as the milk challenge test with respect to the quantity of lactose that should be used. (See previous discussion.) Lastly, the breath test can be falsely abnormal when there is spread of bacteria from the colon into the small intestine, a condition called bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel. When overgrowth occurs, the bacteria that have moved up into the small intestine get to the lactose in the intestine before there has been enough time for the lactose to be digested and absorbed normally, and these bacteria produce hydrogen and/or methane. This may lead erroneously to a diagnosis of genetic lactase deficiency; the abnormal test is due to an intestinal condition. Other conditions also interfere with the breath test. Thus, diseases that markedly speed up transit of lactose through the small intestine prevent lactose from being fully digested and absorbed, leading to a misdiagnosis of lactose intolerance. Recent treatment with antibiotics can suppress colonic bacteria and their production of hydrogen or methane and lead to a misdiagnosis of lactose tolerance. Fortunately, these latter conditions are uncommon and usually can be anticipated on the basis of a person's history or symptoms."" "
Other tests to diagnose lactose intolerance,"""The appearance and disappearance of lactase in the intestinal lining is controlled by genes.  It is possible to analyze DNA, the substance of genes, from cells in the blood to determine if an individual has the genes that program disappearance of lactase.  If they do, then they are very likely to be lactose intolerant.  Genetic testing is the most direct way of diagnosing congenital or developmental lactase deficiency.  Unfortunately, the test is relatively complex, expensive, and often not easily available.  Moreover, it usually is not necessary to know an individual's lactase genetics to diagnose and treat.""'The most direct test for lactase deficiency is biopsy of the intestinal lining with measurement of lactase levels in the lining. The biopsy can be obtained by ''endoscopy'' or by special capsules that are passed through the mouth or nose and into the small intestine. The analysis of lactase levels in the biopsy requires specialized procedures that are not often available, and, as a result, lactase levels are not often measured except for research purposes.''The blood glucose test is an older test for lactase deficiency and lactose intolerance. For the blood glucose test, lactose is ingested (usually 0.75 to 1.5 gm. of lactose per kg of body weight) after an overnight fast, and serial blood samples are drawn and analyzed for glucose. If the level of blood glucose rises more than 25 mg/100ml, it means that the lactose has been split in the intestine and the resulting glucose has been absorbed into the blood. This implies that lactase levels are normal. Unfortunately, the blood glucose test, though simple in principle, requires the collection of multiple samples of blood. Moreover, the test has many real and potential problems, the most common of which is false positive tests, that is, an abnormal test in people who have normal lactase levels and no lactose intolerance. For these reasons, the blood glucose test is not often used.' "
Is there a test for lactose intolerance in infants and young children?,"'The ''stool'' acidity test is a test for lactase deficiency in infants and young children. For the ''stool'' acidity test, the infant or child is given a small amount of lactose orally. Several consecutive stool samples then are tested for acidity. With a deficiency of lactase, unabsorbed lactose enters the colon and is split into glucose and galactose. Some of the glucose and galactose is broken down by the bacteria into acids, for example, lactic acid. Lactic acid turns the stool acidic. Therefore, a lactase deficient infant or child will develop an acidic stool following the test dose of lactose.''Despite the availability of the stool acidity test, the superiority of breath testing has led to modifications in the equipment for collecting breath samples that makes it easier to do breath testing in young children and even infants. As a result, the stool acidity test is not done frequently.' "
What is the treatment for lactose intolerance?,"'The most obvious means of treating lactose intolerance is by reducing the amount of lactose in the diet. Fortunately, most people who are lactose intolerant can tolerate small or even moderate amounts of lactose. It often takes only elimination of the major milk-containing products to obtain sufficient relief from their symptoms. Thus, it may be necessary to eliminate only milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and ice cream. Though yogurt contains large amounts of lactose, it often is well-tolerated by lactose intolerant people. This may be so because the bacteria used to make yogurt contain lactase, and the lactase is able to split some of the lactose during storage of the yogurt as well as after the yogurt is eaten (in the stomach and intestine). Yogurt also has been shown to empty more slowly from the stomach than an equivalent amount of milk. This allows more time for intestinal lactase to split the lactose in yogurt, and, at least theoretically, would result in less lactose reaching the colon.''Most supermarkets carry milk that has had the lactose already split by the addition of lactase. Substitutes for milk also are available, including ''soy'' and rice milk. Acidophilus-containing milk is not beneficial since it contains as much lactose as regular milk, and acidophilus bacteria do not split lactose.''For individuals who are intolerant to even small amounts of lactose, the dietary restrictions become more severe. Any purchased product containing milk must be avoided. It is especially important to eliminate prepared foods containing milk purchased from the supermarket and dishes from ''restaurants'' that have sauces.''Another means to reduce symptoms of lactose intolerance is to ingest any milk-containing foods during meals. Meals (particularly meals containing fat) reduce the rate at which the stomach empties into the small intestine. This reduces the rate at which lactose enters the small intestine and allows more time for the limited amount of lactase to split the lactose without being overwhelmed by the full load of lactose at once. Studies have shown that the absorption of lactose from whole milk, which contains fat, is greater than from non-fat milk, perhaps for this very reason. Nevertheless, the substitution of whole milk or yogurt for non-fat milk or yogurt does not seem to reduce the symptoms of lactose intolerance.''Caplets or tablets of lactase are available to take with milk-containing foods.''Some people find that by slowly increasing the amount of milk or milk-containing products in their diets they are able to tolerate larger amounts of lactose without developing symptoms. This adaptation to increasing amounts of milk is not due to increases in lactase in the intestine. Adaptation probably results from alterations in the bacteria in the colon. Increasing amounts of lactose entering the colon change the colonic environment, for example, by increasing the acidity of the colon. These changes may alter the way in which the colonic bacteria handle lactose. For example, the bacteria may produce less gas. There also may be a reduction in the secretion of water and, therefore, less ''diarrhea''. Nevertheless, it is not clear how frequently or how much progressive increases in milk intake increase the quantities of milk that can be ingested.''Milk and milk-containing products are the best sources of dietary calcium, so it is no wonder that ''calcium deficiency'' is common among lactose intolerant persons. This increases the risk and severity of ''osteoporosis'' and the resulting bone ''fractures''. It is important, therefore, for lactose intolerant persons to supplement their diets with calcium. A deficiency of ''vitamin D'' also causes disease of the bones and fractures. Milk is fortified with ''vitamin D'' and is a major source of vitamin D for many people. Although other sources of vitamin D can substitute for milk, it is a good idea for lactose-intolerant persons to take supplemental vitamin D to prevent ''vitamin D deficiency''.'  "
Which specialties of doctors treat lactose intolerance?,"'Since internists, pediatricians, and family practitioners all see patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, they all are called upon to diagnose and treat lactose intolerance.  If their attempts to diagnose and treat do not result in adequate clinical benefit, patients usually will be referred to a ''gastroenterologist'', an internist or pediatrician specially trained in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. These specialists will be able to diagnose and treat causes of symptoms other than lactose intolerance.' "
What are the long-term consequences of lactose intolerance?,"'The important long-term health consequence of lactose intolerance is calcium deficiency that leads to ''osteoporosis''. Less commonly, vitamin D deficiency may occur and compound the bone disease. Both of these health issues can be prevented easily by calcium and vitamin D ''supplements''. The real problem is that many lactose intolerant people who consciously or unconsciously avoid milk do not realize that they need supplements. ' "
What is new in lactose intolerance?,"'Genetic testing of DNA of individuals to make a diagnosis of lactase deficiency has already been discussed. This is likely to be an important research tool for studying lactase deficiency. It is still too early to know how helpful this sophisticated test will be in the clinical evaluation and treatment of patients. It is an expensive test. The most important question to answer usually is, does lactose cause symptoms, and not, whether an individual is lactase deficient.''In 1998, scientists were able to make lactose intolerant rats tolerant to lactose by transferring the gene for lactase production to their intestinal lining cells. It is unlikely that this type of gene therapy will find much of an application in people. Nevertheless, it is a fascinating example of what science can accomplish.' "
What is the lactose tolerance test?,"'The lactose tolerance test is a test for diagnosing an intolerance of ingested lactose. ''Lactose intolerance'' is a genetic condition in which individuals are unable to digest and absorb the lactose ''sugar'"" in cow's milk. "" "
What is lactose intolerance?,"'Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest the ''sugar'' in milk, lactose. Milk is an important source of ''nutrition'' for children and even some adults. With normal lactose tolerance, all of the lactose is broken down (digested) in the intestine by an enzyme into two smaller sugars (galactose and glucose) which then are absorbed into the body. As a result, normally no lactose reaches the colon. ''On the other hand, in individuals with lactose intolerance who lack the intestinal enzyme that breaks down the lactose, the ingested lactose is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon where it is used by the bacteria in the colon. The bacteria produce chemicals that cause ''diarrhea'', and also produce ''gas''. ''Abdominal pain'' also may occur. ' "
How is the lactose tolerance test done?,"'The lactose tolerance test requires an individual to drink a liquid that contains lactose. In the small intestine among lactose tolerant individuals, the ingested lactose is split into galactose and glucose which then are absorbed from the intestine and go into the blood. Several blood samples are taken over a two hour period following the ingestion of the lactose to measure the blood glucose level. If lactose tolerance is normal, the glucose level in the blood rises due to the absorption of glucose from the intestine. If there is lactose intolerance, the glucose level does not rise.' "
What other tests can detect lactose intolerance?,"""Many clinicians simply make this diagnosis based on improvement of symptoms when lactose is withheld from the patient's ""'diet'' and affravation when it is re-introduced. Other tests used to detect lactose intolerance include the lactose ''hydrogen breath test'' and ''stool acidity test'', the latter is primarily used in infants and very young children. There also is a genetic test which can determine whether an individual has or does not have the intestinal enzyme that is required for the ''digestion'' and absorption of lactose.' "
What is a transient ischemic attack (TIA)?,"'The primary role of the brain is to send signals to the body for motor function and respond to receive signals received through the five senses (sight, ''hearing'', touch, smell, and taste). The brain processes information both through conscious thought, and unconsciously through the nervous systems that control basic bodily functions, like heart rate, ''breathing'', and temperature control.''When a portion of the brain loses its blood supply, it can become damaged and stop functioning. When a portion of the brain does not function, the part of the body that it controls also stops working. This is called a stroke or a ''cerebrovascular accident'' (CVA). If the brain is able to regain its blood supply quickly, then the CVA symptoms may resolve; this is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA is a stroke that resolves by itself. ' The brain is arranged so that the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body, and the left side of the brain controls the right of the body. Vision is located in the back of the brain (occiput), and balance and coordination are located at the bottom of the brain (cerebellum). Blood supply to the brain comes from the two carotid arteries that are located in the front of the neck, and the 
two vertebral arteries that run in the back of the neck through small canals in the bony spine (vertebrae).  All four arteries connect at a junction of blood vessels located in the base of the brain (called the Circle of Willis), and from there smaller arteries 
branch out to supply the brain with oxygen and nutrients."
"What are the 
causes of transient ischemic attack (TIA)?","'Loss of blood supply to portions of the brain may occur for a variety of reasons. A blood vessel can become blocked, and blood supply to a part of the brain is lost, or a blood vessel can leak blood into the brain (''brain hemorrhage''). Most commonly however, the blood vessel is blocked. The blockage can be caused by a ''blood clot'' that forms in the blood vessel (thrombosis) or it can be caused by a clot or debris that floats downstream (embolus).''Fatty plaque formation in the blood vessel wall is called atherosclerosis or ""hardening of the arteries."" Plaque can rupture and cause a small ''blood clot'' to form and occlude the blood vessel. Blockage can also occur when debris from narrowing of a carotid artery breaks off, and floats downstream to cause the occlusion. Sometimes, in people with an irregular heart beat called ''atrial fibrillation'', small blood clots can be formed within the heart and travel to the brain to cause the obstruction.''Brain hemorrhage or bleeding in the brain can be due to an ''aneurysm'', a weak spot in a blood vessel that ruptures and spills blood into the brain tissue, or it may be due to spontaneous bleeding caused by poorly controlled ''hypertension'' (''high blood pressure''). Such bleeding more commonly results in the irreversible damage of a stroke, and would not necessarily resolve to be classified as a TIA.'  "
What are the risk factors for transient ischemic attack (TIA)?,"'The risk factors for TIA or stroke are the same as those for other ''vascular disease'', similar to heart attack (''coronary artery disease'') or ''peripheral vascular disease'', which causes decreased blood flow to the legs. These risk factors include:''Moreover, any condition that results in stagnant blood flow and or clotting may result in a TIA due to embolization of a blood clot. Such conditions may include ''atrial fibrillation'', large ''heart attacks'', and severe ''weakness'' of the heart muscle (''cardiomyopathy'') .' family history smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes."
"What are the 
symptoms of transient ischemic attack (TIA)?","'The intensity and location of the blood limitation to the brain will determine what symptoms will occur as a result of a stroke or TIA. Many people experience ''confusion'', weakness, and lethargy. If the loss of blood supply is in an area supplied by the middle cerebral artery, a classic sign may include weakness or ''paralysis'' and numbness of one side of the body. The whole side may be affected, or just one limb. Often there is a facial droop. If the stroke is on the left side of the body where the speech centers are usually located, there may be difficulty understanding words or speaking. Partial ''vision loss'' may also be part of the constellation of symptoms.''Strokes'' involving the vertebral arteries decrease blood supply to the base of the brain and may cause a drop attack (a sudden fall while ''walking'' or standing, and then a quick recovery), an unexpected collapse, incoordination, or difficulty walking.''The important distinction between stroke and TIA is resolution of the symptoms. By definition, the symptoms of a TIA must completely resolve. And, while this most often occurs within the first few minutes after symptom onset, it may take up to 24 hours to have complete return to normal function.''A special type of TIA is amaurosis fugax. Transient ''blindness'' in one eye occurs because debris from a narrowed carotid artery clogs the artery (ophthalmic artery) that supplies blood to the retina of the eye.'  "
How is transient ischemic attack (TIA) diagnosed?,"'TIA is diagnosed by history and physical examination. Since most often the symptoms have resolved, the physician will need to complete a thorough history from the patient and family or friends who witnessed the event. The physical exam will include careful attention to the neurologic examination. This may include:''If the diagnosis of TIA is made, further urgent testing is usually recommended, including: '  Assess mental status to make certain the patient is alert and oriented. Check eye range of motion and facial movement to evaluate the cranial nerves (the short nerves that run from the brain to the face and neck). Listen to the neck with a stethoscope to detect abnormal sounds that may signal narrowing of the blood vessel (carotid bruits). Check for a regular heart rhythm to rule out the presence of atrial fibrillation. Examine the arms and legs for tone, power, and sensation. Check coordination and balance. Electrocardiogram (EKG) to confirm a regular heart rate Computerized tomography (CT scan) of the brain to assess bleeding Carotid ultrasound to assess for narrowing of the large blood vessels in the neck Some hospitals have CT angiogram available to evaluate the cerebral, carotid, and vertebral arteries. This test is the same as a CT of the head with the addition of intravenous dye into the blood vessels to the arteries. Routine blood tests may include a complete blood count (CBC) to assess for anemia 
(low red blood cell count) or too few platelets (thrombocytopenia). If the patient takes warfarin (Coumadin), a blood thinner, then an international normalized ratio (INR - a blood test that measures the degree of blood thinning) or prothrombin time (PT), may be performed to assess blood clotting measurements. If there is concern that the heart is the source of blood clot or debris, then an echocardiogram or sound wave tracing of the heart may be considered."
What is the treatment for a transient ischemic attack (TIA)?,"'Treatment for a transient ischemic attack is aimed at preventing a second stroke. Since there is no way of determining the severity of future episodes, and no guarantee that the symptoms will resolve, ''prevention'' of a future TIA or CVA is crucial. ''Treatment guidelines address a variety of targeted goals. ''Smoking'', excessive ''alcohol'', ''obesity'' and lack of physical activity are considered risks for future stroke. The following recommendations are now suggested: '  If the patient was not taking 
aspirin when the TIA occurred, it usually is started at a dose of 325 mg per day. If the patient was taking aspirin, another antiplatelet drug called dipyridamole may be added. Aggrenox is a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole. Headache is often a side effect. If the patient cannot tolerate aspirin because of allergy or stomach upset clopidogrel (Plavix) may be used.  Even if the patient does not have hypertension or high blood pressure, there may be benefit in taking anti-hypertensive medications. Two classes of drugs are recommended to be started at the same time, a diuretic and an 
ACE inhibitor. The goal for normal blood pressure is 120/80.  Guidelines recommend that a statin drug be started, even if cholesterol levels are normal. Simvastatin (Zocor) is the most commonly recommended medication, but new guidelines limit the amount prescribed per day because of the risk of liver side effects. Smoking: Counseling, smoking cessation aids like 
nicotine gum or medications like
varenicline (Chantix) should be considered. Environmental smoke should be avoided. Alcohol: Intake should be limited to two or fewer drinks a day for men and one or less for women. Obesity: Overweight people should try to lose weight using a combination of diet, exercise and counseling. The goal is a BMI of 18.5-24.9 and a waist line of 35 inches or less for women and 40 inches or less for men.  Exercise: 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily is recommended for those who are able. For 
people with disabilities, a tailored exercise program to their capabilities should be arranged. "
What is the prognosis for transient ischemic attack (TIA)?,"'A transient ischemic attack should be considered a major warning sign of an impending future stroke. Up to 15% of people will experience a stroke within three months of TIA. Since there is no way of predicting that stroke-like symptoms will resolve, the patient and family need to be educated should symptoms occur, they need to access medical care emergently'' activating the emergency medical services system and calling 911.''If a stroke occurs, there is a very short period of time where the thrombolytic (clot busting drugs like ''alteplase'' [TPA]), can be used to reverse a stroke. In most hospitals, the drug can only be given within 4 1/2 hours of onset of ''stroke symptoms''. In that time frame, the patient needs to get to the hospital, the diagnosis needs to be made, laboratory tests and head ''CT scans'"" need to be performed, neurologic consultation needs to occur, and the drug administered. The longer the delay, greater the risk that the drug won't work and that complications such as bleeding into the brain will occur.""'Specialized interventional radiologists can inject TPA directly into the clot that has blocked the blood vessel in the brain. This can extend the time frame to six hours or longer, but currently this treatment is not widely available.''TIAs should be considered the equivalent of ''angina'' of the brain. In ''heart disease'', angina is the heart ''pain'' that warns of potential heart attack. When heart muscle is damaged, it cannot be replaced or repaired. Similarly, brain tissue is at risk when there is decreased blood supply and it, too, cannot be replaced.'  "
Stroke vs. mini-stroke (TIA) comparison of differences,"   Mini-stroke (transient ischemic attack, TIA) and stroke usually are caused by blockage of an artery in the brain, and less often by bleeding into the brain tissue. Strokes usually are classified as either ischemic or hemorrhagic. The causes of strokes and min-strokes (transient ischemic attack, TIA) are the same, however, blood flow leakage or blockage is temporary in mini-strokes, and blood flow returns spontaneously. In most strokes, blood flow does not return spontaneously. The majority of mini-strokes produce symptoms that are temporary, while the majority of strokes produce symptoms that are often long lasting, and cause permanent disability. Symptoms of a mini-stroke may include one or more of the following:Weakness or numbness in your arms and/or legs, usually on one side of the bodyDysphasia (difficulty speaking)DizzinessVision changesTingling (paresthesias)Abnormal taste and/or smellsConfusionLoss of balanceAltered consciousness and/or passing out Weakness or numbness in your arms and/or legs, usually on one side of the body Dysphasia (difficulty speaking) Dizziness Vision changes Tingling (paresthesias) Abnormal taste and/or smells Confusion Loss of balance Altered consciousness and/or passing out Symptoms of a stroke include those of a mini-stroke, but the symptoms do not resolve. Treatment for mini-stroke usually is medication to reduce blood clot risk, reduction of other risk factors (smoking, for example) and follow-up to consider surgery if the cause is an aneurysm that occasionally slowly leaks blood. A stroke is a medical emergency and treatment depends upon the type of stroke. A stroke caused by a blood clot (ischemic) is treated with clot busting drugs or mechanical methods to remove the clot. Hemorrhagic (bleeding into brain tissue) stroke requires life-saving surgery, performed by a neurosurgeon. Mini-strokes symptoms are short-term that resolve, while strokes often produce long-term symptoms (disabilities). In mini-strokes, normal function returns quickly, but with strokes, normal function may never return. Recovery of normal function occurs quickly in mini-strokes, but strokes usually have an extended time for recovery that includes therapy. In mini-strokes, blood flow returns spontaneously (the body resolves the blockage and/or leakage) and causes little or no damage to brain cells, whereas strokes do not have spontaneous blood flow return (the body does not resolve the blockage and/or leakage) and brain cells are permanently damaged and/or destroyed. Damage from a stroke is permanent, and an individual may never regain normal function of the part of the body affected. Other terms for stroke include cerebral vascular accident (CVA). Other terms for mini stroke include TIA, transient ischemic attack, and mini-stroke."
What are stroke and mini-stroke (TIA)? What causes them?,"'A stroke occurs when brain tissue becomes deprived of oxygen resulting in malfunction of the brain, and brain tissue is damaged or destroyed. A stroke usually is due to either blockage (ischemic) or leakage (hemorrhage) of blood flow by an artery that supplies oxygen rich blood to areas in the brain. If the extent of brain tissue damage is large, the person may die. A stroke is a medical emergency. It is the fifth most common cause of death in the U.S.''A subset of strokes is termed a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ""''mini-stroke''."" In a mini-stroke, brain cells are dysfunctional for short period of time and produce symptoms similar to stroke. However, mini-''stroke symptoms'"" and signs usually are resolved within a short time (minutes to hours) (usually because the brain's arteries involved are only blocked, or may leak blood into the brain, intermittently)."" "
What are the warning signs and symptoms of stroke vs. mini-stroke?,"'Warning signs and symptoms of a stroke and mini-stroke are the same, and include:'   Weakness or numbness in your arms and/or legs, usually on one side of the body Dysphasia (difficulty speaking) Dizziness Vision changes Tingling (paresthesias) Abnormal taste and/or smells Confusion Loss of balance Altered consciousness and/or passing out"
How long do the symptoms of stroke vs. mini-stroke last?,"'Stroke symptoms'' typically last more than 24 hours, and may or may not resolve, even with therapy. Some ''stroke symptoms'' may never resolve or get better.''TIA symptoms last for a short time. Symptoms can begin to resolve in about 1 to 5 minutes, which is typical, but some may take about 24 hours to resolve.' "
How can you tell if a person is having a stroke or mini-stroke (FAST)?,"'The term ""''FAST''"" is an easy way to help determine if a person is having a stroke or mini-stroke, and what you should do. ''FAST'' ''applies to both mini-strokes and strokes. The National Stroke Association and other organizations suggest that you use FAST as a way to remember what to look for, and what to do if a person develops any of these warning signs and symptoms of a stroke or mini-stroke.' F stands for face. Ask the person to smile, if one side of the face droops, it is a warning sign. A stands for arms. Ask the person to lift both arms, if one arm drifts down or has difficulty moving, it is a warning sign. S stands for speech: Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase, if the speech is slurred or odd, it is a warning sign. T stands for time: If a person develops any of the warning signs, it is time to call 911 and have him or her evaluated for a stroke and/or mini-stroke at an emergency department."
"What is worse, a stroke or mini-stroke?","'The answer to this question depends upon several factors. Many doctors would conclude that a large hemorrhagic stroke is the worst kind of stroke because they often are untreatable, and cause devastating damage to the brain from which there is little or no recovery. However, other types of strokes, for example, a ''blood clot'' in the brain, also can have similar devastating consequences. These strokes can result in disability and death just like hemorrhagic strokes. Some people consider being unable to care for themselves as a fate worse than death, and would say that survival with extreme disabilities (cannot feed themselves, unable to talk, cannot do any personal hygiene, for example) is the worst kind of stroke. Perhaps the worst kind of stroke is the one that occurs in yourself or your loved one, no matter to what extent is the disability.' "
Which side effects of stroke vs. mini-stroke are the same?,"'The after/side effects of stroke and mini-strokes can be the same, especially immediately after any symptoms develop, and can include:'   Numbness or weakness of the face, arms and/or legs, often the weakness is only on one side of the body Difficulty speaking or understanding speech Abrupt loss of vision in one or both eyes Dizziness Loss of balance and/or coordination Confusion"
What are the differences between the side effects of stroke vs. mini-stroke?,"'All of the signs and symptoms of mini-strokes usually resolve within five minutes; a few people resolve in less than 24 hours.''Stroke side effects and symptoms last longer than 24 hours. Some may last a lifetime. The early ''symptoms of stroke'' may resolve partially, or never. When this happens, other signs and symptoms such as ''depression'', muscle atrophy (muscle loss), and worsening of early symptoms may progress over time.' "
Can a mini-stroke lead to other types of strokes?,"'TIAs or mini-strokes are considered by the American Stroke Association to be major warning signs of a stroke. For example, about 7% to 40% of individuals experiencing a stroke report having a TIA sometime before their first stroke. Moreover, about one-third of people who have a mini-stroke have a stroke within a year after their mini-stroke.' "
What is the treatment for stroke vs. mini-stroke?,"'Strokes and mini-strokes are not treated exactly the same. Strokes are a medical emergency. Treatment for a stroke begins with a ''CT scan'' of the brain to help determine the difference between a ''blood clot'' in the brain or an artery rupture and hemorrhage. The type of treatment then depends upon the type of stroke.''A mini-stroke also is a medical emergency. However, by the time the person receives medical care, the mini-''stroke symptoms'' may have resolved, or are resolving. Hospitalization for TIA may be necessary for additional tests, and prescription medication and/or surgery may be necessary depending upon the cause.''Mini-strokes may predict that an individual may (up to 40% chance) have a stroke within a year of the TIA.'  "
What is the recovery time and life expectancy for stroke vs. mini-stroke?,"'Mini-strokes or TIAs resolve spontaneously, and the individual recovers normal function quickly, usually within a few minutes up to about 24 hours without medical treatment. The prognosis for TIA is very good; however, TIAs frequently (up to 40%) are the way of telling you that in the next year you may have a stroke.''The recovery and prognosis for a stroke is quite variable. Early treatment may increase recovery and improve prognosis. Unfortunately, the prognosis and recovery decline if a stroke is severe (a large area of brain tissue is damaged and/or dies) or the symptoms are present for more than a few hours and the individual is outside of the window for treatment.' "
Introduction to lumbar spinal fusion,"'The lumbar spine is the lower portion of the spine found at the center of the curve of the low back, below the rib cage. This area can be a common source of pain. ''Low back pain'' is the second most common reason for visits to the family physician, behind the ''common cold''. As people become older, various changes occur in the lumbar spine that can cause pain. In most cases these changes are due to normal ''degenerative arthritis'' (wear of cartilage over time). The physician must also rule out other more serious conditions including ''tumor'', infection, ''scoliosis'' (curvature of the spine), ''spondylolisthesis'' (slippage of one spinal bone on another), or ''fracture''.''Fortunately, most patients with ''low back pain'' will have improvement in their symptoms regardless of treatment within six weeks. During that time the physician has various treatment options including medications, physical therapy, or injections that can help ease the symptoms. Some of those patients that do not improve after six to 12 weeks may be candidates for surgery. The spine surgeon has different types of surgical options available based on the specific cause of pain. ' "
What is lumbar spinal fusion?,"'Lumbar spinal fusion is an operation that causes the vertebrae (bones of the spine) in the lower back to grow together. The goal of the lumbar fusion is to have the two vertebrae fuse (grow solidly together) so that there is no longer any motion between them. Removing the intervertebral disc (cushion between the bones) or ''bone spurs'' can reduce some of the pressure on the nerves, helping to reduce pain. Additionally, by fusing the two vertebrae together, this may stop the formation of bone spurs at that location, further reducing pain and potential nerve injury. ''There are many different specific techniques to try to fuse the vertebrae together. The surgery can be performed either through an incision in the back, the abdomen, or a combination of both. In many cases metal screws and rods are placed from the back into the bones to hold them in position while the fusion occurs. During an interbody fusion, the surgeon removes the intervertebral disc and places either a bone graft or a metal or ''plastic'' cage, or a combination of these in its place. The decision on what type of fusion is best for each patient is based on their specific complaints and the cause of symptoms. Spinal fusion can be very effective in the properly selected patient.'  "
What is minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'Minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion is similar to traditional lumbar spinal fusion, but it uses smaller incisions and causes less damage to the surrounding tissues during surgery.''As with traditional lumbar spinal fusion, there are many specific techniques available to try to fuse the vertebrae together using minimally invasive techniques. This can be done through the abdomen, from the back, from the side, or with any combination of these.''Minimally invasive lumbar fusion through the abdomen uses four small incisions, approximately ½ inch in length. A ''fiber'' optic viewing camera is used, similar to other minimally invasive procedures including laparoscopic gallbladder or ''appendix'' removal.''Fusion with screws and rods can be performed through the back using several 1-2 inch incisions. In these cases a series of increasingly larger dilators (hollow tubes with solid inserts) are inserted through the incisions to help spread the muscles apart. Once the muscles have been moved away, the screws and rods can be placed through the dilator tubes. In some cases an operating microscope is used to help the surgeon see more clearly.'""One of the most recent advances in minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion is the ability to perform fusion surgery through the patient's side. There are several techniques that allow the surgeon to make a small incision, approximately 2 inches in the patient's side, directly over the planned fusion site. The muscles are then carefully moved aside, and a series of increasing larger dilators are inserted down to the lumbar spine. Specialized instruments can then be used through the dilator tube to remove the intervertebral disc and place a bone graft or metal or plastic spacer in its place. This technique is typically combined with a procedure from the back to place rods and screws for additional support."" "
What are the advantages of minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'The major advantage of all of these minimally invasive techniques is that there is less damage caused to the surrounding tissues. Unfortunately, in traditional spinal surgery it is necessary to cut through muscles and move them out of the way in order to reach the spine. This can cause a large amount of pain following surgery, and it can lengthen the recovery time. Instead of cutting and moving muscles, the minimally invasive techniques can more gently spread through the muscles to allow access to the spine. This is much less painful for the patient, and it does not require as long of a recovery period for the muscle to heal.''Another benefit of less muscle damage is less blood loss and thus a reduced need for blood transfusions using the minimally invasive techniques. There is often less need for narcotic pain medications following this form of surgery, and a shorter hospital stay.' "
What is the disadvantage of minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'As with any new technique, one of the major disadvantages is the additional time needed to perform the procedure. While a surgeon may be very comfortable with the traditional surgical fusion techniques, it will take time to be able to achieve the same outcome using these new methods. Surgeons with more experience can now perform lumbar spinal fusion in equal or even less time than with the traditional techniques.''Not all surgeons perform these techniques, so it may not be available from your current surgeon or in your area. Because this is a relatively new technique, many insurance companies consider this to be an investigational surgery and do not provide insurance coverage for it, so a patient should check with the insurer prior to surgery regarding coverage.'  "
How effective is minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'The results for the minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion through the abdomen have not been as good as the traditional open anterior (from the front of the spine) fusion techniques. The success of the fusion has been less reliable, the operative times are longer and there are increased risks of injury to the nerves using the minimally invasive techniques. Because of this, many surgeons have stopped using this technique.''The results of the minimally invasive procedures through the back have been much more promising. Experienced surgeons are able to perform lumbar spinal fusion through the back quicker, with similar fusion rates, less blood loss, and quicker recovery times than using traditional techniques. '""The newer minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion techniques though the patient's side are still being refined. The initial techniques had some increased risk of damage to nerves, but more recent changes have made these even safer and more effective. The results so far are very promising for this technique, but there have been a limited number of studies. Additionally, since this was only recently developed, there are fewer surgeons performing this technique."" "
Am I a candidate for minimally lumbar invasive spinal fusion?,"'First, you and your doctor need to determine if you are a candidate for spinal fusion. Remember, the majority of patients with ''low back pain'' recover within six weeks regardless of treatment. If you have had prolonged symptoms you should see your physician. If it is decided you may need surgery you will be referred to a spinal surgeon for further evaluation. If a fusion is thought to be potentially beneficial for you, the option of minimally invasive techniques can then be discussed with your surgeon.' "
What is an IUD?,"'IUD stands for an ''intrauterine device'', which is a small T-shaped ''plastic'' device positioned in the uterus to prevent ''pregnancy''. The IUD acts as a foreign body in the uterus and hampers the union of sperm and ovum by causing a reaction in the uterus.''There are two types of IUDs:''Copper IUDs'': It is hormone-free and mainly consists of copper. It kills sperm before it reaches the egg. Copper IUDs like ParaGard last\xa0longer than hormonal IUDs.''Hormonal IUDs'': It mainly releases the hormone progestin into the uterus, which prevents sperm and the egg from uniting. The four common hormonal IUDs available in the United States are:' Liletta Kyleena Mirena Skyla"
What is Mirena?,"'Mirena is a hormonal IUD that consists of progestin (''levonorgestrel''), which is similar to a hormone produced by women. It prevents pregnancy by the following methods:' Makes cervical fluid thicker Interferes with sperm movement Reduces sperm survival Prevents fertilization of an egg Changes the lining of the uterus to prevent the attachment of a fertilized egg"
 What are the other side effects of using IUD?,"'Side effects, although mild, are present and subside with time. They are:''Most of the side effects subside in about three to six months once the body gets used to the IUD.''Some rare and serious side effects of IUDs include:' Weight gain due to progesterone Pain while IUD insertion Backaches or cramping for the first few days Irregular bleeding or spotting between periods Irregular or heavy bleeding during periods Acne Mood changes Excess hair growth Nausea Headache Ovarian cysts It may cause extrauterine pregnancy (ectopic) in some cases Risk of pelvic infection Slippage or movement of IUD Device expelled from the uterus"
Who should avoid using Mirena (IUDs)?,'People with the following conditions should avoid using Mirena:' Sexually-transmitted disease Pelvic infection Immediately after delivery Cervical cancer or uterine cancer Unexplainable vaginal bleeding Liver disease Breast cancer
What are other birth control options?,"'If IUD doesn’t work for you, then consider one of the many ''birth control'' options available. Consult a physician before deciding on which ''birth control'' option suits you better. The most common ''birth control methods'' include:' Birth control pills Depo-Provera or other birth control injections Vaginal rings Contraceptive implant The Xulane patch"
What is a miscarriage?,"'A miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a ''pregnancy'' from ''conception'"" to 20 weeks' gestation. The term ""'stillbirth'"" refers to the death of a fetus after 20 weeks' gestation. Miscarriage is sometimes referred to as spontaneous abortion because the medical term abortion means the ending of a pregnancy, whether intentional or unintentional. Most miscarriages occur in the ""'first trimester'' of pregnancy, from seven to twelve weeks after conception.' "
How common is miscarriage?,"'Miscarriage is very common. As many or even most miscarriages occur so early in pregnancy that a woman does not even realize that she is ''pregnant'', it is difficult to estimate how frequently miscarriages occur. Some experts believe that about half of all fertilized eggs die before implantation or are miscarried. Of known ''pregnancies'' (in which a woman misses a period or has a positive ''pregnancy test''), about 10% to 20% end in miscarriage.' "
What causes miscarriage?,"'The majority of miscarriages are believed to be caused by genetic problems within the embryo that would prevent a baby from developing normally and surviving after birth. These fatal genetic errors are not usually related to genetic problems in the mother.''In other cases, certain illnesses or medical conditions can cause miscarriage or may increase the risk of miscarriage. Mothers who have ''diabetes'' or ''thyroid disease'' are at increased risk of miscarriage. Infections that spread to the placenta, including some viral infections, can also increase the risk of miscarriage.''In general, risk factors for miscarriage include the following:''Women who have had one miscarriage have an incidence of miscarriage of about 20%, whereas women who have three or more consecutive miscarriages may have a risk as high as 43%.'   Older maternal age Cigarette smoking (>10 cigarettes/day) Moderate to high alcohol consumption Trauma to the uterus Radiation exposure Previous miscarriage Maternal weight extremes (BMI either below 18.5 or above 25 kg/m2) Anatomical abnormalities of the uterus Illicit drug use Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) around the time of conception"
What are the types of miscarriage?,"'Miscarriages are sometimes referred to by tissue-specific names to reflect the clinical findings or the type of miscarriage. Examples include:' Threatened abortion: a woman may experience vaginal bleeding or others signs of miscarriage (see below), but loss of the pregnancy has not yet occurred Incomplete abortion: some of the products of conception (fetal and placental tissues) have been expelled from the uterus, but some remain. Complete abortion: all of the tissue from the pregnancy has been expelled Missed abortion: the fetus has not developed, so there is no viable pregnancy, but there is placental tissue and/or fetal tissue contained within the uterus Septic abortion: a miscarriage in which there is infection in the uterus which contains retained fetal and/or placental tissue."
What are signs and symptoms of a miscarriage?,"'Vaginal bleeding'' and ''pelvic pain'' are the hallmark ''symptoms of miscarriage''. All vaginal bleeding during pregnancy should be investigated, although not all instances of bleeding result from a miscarriage. Bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy is very common and does not typically signify a miscarriage. The ''pain'' tends to be dull and cramping, and it may come and go or be present constantly. Sometimes, there is passage of fetal or placental tissue. This material may appear whitish and covered with blood. The bleeding may be associated with the passage of\xa0''blood clots''. The amount of bleeding does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the situation, and miscarriage may be associated with bleeding that ranges from mild to severe.'  "
How is miscarriage diagnosed?,"'An ''ultrasound'' examination is typically performed if a woman has symptoms of a miscarriage. The ultrasound can determine if the pregnancy is intact and if a fetal heartbeat is present. Ultrasound examination can also reveal whether the pregnancy is an ''ectopic pregnancy'"" (located outside of the uterus, typically in the Fallopian tube), which may have similar symptoms and signs as miscarriage. Other tests that may be performed including blood tests for pregnancy hormones, blood counts to determine the degree of blood loss or to see whether infection is present, and a pelvic examination. The mother's ""'blood type'' should also be checked at the time of a miscarriage, so that Rh-negative women can receive an injection of rho-D immune globulin (RhoGam) to prevent problems in future pregnancies.' "
What happens after a miscarriage?,"'There are no specific treatments that can stop a miscarriage, although women who are at risk and have not yet miscarried may be advised to rest in bed, abstain from sexual activity, and restrict all physical activity until any warning signs are no longer present. Once a miscarriage occurs, there is no treatment available. In many cases, the miscarriage will take its course, and unless there is severe ''pain'' and cramping or severe blood loss, no treatment is required. If a miscarriage does not progress to spontaneous expulsion of all pregnancy tissue from the uterus, a procedure known as a dilatation and curettage (D&C) can be performed to remove the remaining pregnancy material. This treatment is used in the case of a missed abortion, for example, when the pregnancy material is not expelled from the uterus.''As mentioned above, women who are Rh-negative will receive a dose of rho-D immune globulin to prevent complications in future pregnancies.''If a miscarriage is due to infection, antibiotic treatment will be given.''Miscarriage is such a common occurrence that typically, unless known risk factors are present, no special testing is performed. For couples who have experienced more than two miscarriages, diagnostic studies to detect genetic, hormonal, or anatomical problems may be recommended. Some doctors recommend evaluation of the couple after the second miscarriage, particularly if the woman is over 35 years of age.' "
What is the outlook for future pregnancies after a miscarriage?,"'Most women who miscarry go on to have a subsequent pregnancy. The likelihood of a miscarriage in a future pregnancy increases with the total number of miscarriages a woman has previously experienced. In general, the risk of recurrence in women who have had a previous miscarriage is about 15%. The risk is about 30% in women who have had two miscarriages. Most women will have their ''menstrual period'' within 4 to 6 weeks after a miscarriage. Your doctor can advise you when you may start ''trying to conceive'' again. While it is possible to conceive again after your menstrual period has returned, some doctors advise waiting a bit longer, such as another ''menstrual cycle'' or more, to provide enough time for physical and emotional recovery.' "
Can miscarriage be prevented?,"'There is no evidence that bed rest can help prevent miscarriage, but women who have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy are often advised to rest and limit sexual activity until there are no more potential signs of miscarriage. It is possible that some risk factors for miscarriage can be minimized by maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding the use of alcohol, illicit drugs, or tobacco. Screening for, and treatment of, any sexually-transmitted diseases (''STDs'') can also reduce the risk of a miscarriage. In most instances, the ''prevention'"" of a miscarriage is outside of the woman's control."" "
Facts you should know about misophonia," Misophonia is defined as severely negative reactions to sounds that have a specific pattern, meaning, and context to the sufferer based on previous experiences. Other forms of sound sensitivity include hyperacusis (a negative reaction to sound due to particular physical characteristics, like volume, type, and intensity) and phonophobia (a fear of certain sounds). Some research indicates that misophonia may be quite common, occurring in about 20% of the population. While there is no known single cause for misophonia, some theories in that regard include specific problems with the way the central nervous system works or developing an emotional association between a normal, potentially irritating noise to an aversive physical reaction (conditioned response). Risk factors for misophonia include having a mental disorder or another hearing disorder. Prepubescent girls tend to develop the disorder more often than other groups. There are numerous potential triggers for misophonia, to which the sufferer may react to with emotions such as fear, irritation, or anger. This quickly escalates to an extreme level that is clearly out of proportion to the trigger, and the sufferer usually believes their response is uncontrollable. In order to assess whether misophonia is present, health-care professionals will explore whether the symptoms are the result of a medical problem, reaction to a medication, or other substance and seek to rule out mental disorders or other hearing disorders. Some of the approaches that tend to be used to treat misophonia include tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT), cognitive behavioral therapy, adding background noise to the person's environment, and deconditioning the sufferer to their negative reactions. Medication is not usually used to treat misophonia. Complications of misophonia include the sufferer developing problems with their relationships, school, or employment. With treatment, more than 80% of misophonia sufferers can experience significant relief from symptoms. Prevention of misophonia usually focuses on trying to prevent complications of this disorder."
What is misophonia?,"'Misophonia, which literally means ""hatred of sounds,"" while not yet officially recognized as a distinct psychiatric disorder in medical literature, is a source of great distress and sometimes debilitation in its sufferers. The definition of misophonia, which is often classified as a form of decreased sound tolerance, is severely negative reactions to sounds that have a specific pattern, meaning, and context to the sufferer based on previous experiences. This condition usually entails a number of negative reactions, like anger, ''agitation'', and hatred of particular sounds and is different from hyperacusis, another form of decreased sound tolerance, which is defined as a negative reaction to sound due to particular physical characteristics, like volume, type, and intensity. Misophonia should also be distinguished from phonophobia, which refers to a fear of specific sounds. Similarity in spelling is where the commonality of misophonia and misophobia ends, the latter referring to an irrational fear of being contaminated, dirty, or germy.''While there are few specific statistics regarding how often misophonia occurs in the general population, this form of extreme noise sensitivity has been found to occur in up to 60% of people who suffer from ''tinnitus'', also called ''ringing in the ears''. A sample of college students revealed that this condition may be quite common, as it was found in 20% of that sample.'  "
What are causes and risk factors for misophonia?,"'While there is no known single cause for misophonia, it is thought to be associated with the way the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) works rather than any change in its structure/anatomy. Specifically, this disorder is thought to be related to an increase in the hearing (auditory) pathways in the central nervous system, as well as heightened ''anxiety'' and other emotional reactions to sounds. People with one hearing disorder may be at risk for another. For example, people with hyperacusis are at a higher risk for ''tinnitus'', ''hearing loss'', and phonophobia.''Behavioral theories about the development of this disorder usually center around becoming conditioned to having an extreme reaction to normal noises in the environment. In other words, it is thought that this illness develops at least partly as the result of the sufferer developing an emotional association between a normal, potentially irritating noise to an aversive physical reaction. The individual may consider this disorder to be caused by what they perceive to be the ''trauma'' of hearing normal environmental sounds.''Misophonia tends to co-occur with mental disorders like ''obsessive compulsive disorder'', obsessive compulsive personality disorder, '""Tourette's""' disorder, and ''eating disorders''. Girls of prepubescent age have been found to be at higher risk of developing misophonia compared to males and to people of other age groups.' "
"What are misophonia symptoms, signs, and common triggers?","'There are numerous potential triggers for misophonia, including everything from:''For example, the person with misophonia may react with fear, irritation, or rage at what they may consider to be annoying popping of gum or loud chewing. He or she may try to distance himself or herself from the trigger or engage in acting out at the source of the sound, as by yelling at or hitting that person. A key aspect of this disorder is that once the sufferer is exposed to what they deem to be an offensive stimulus, the reaction usually begins with irritability or disgust then quickly escalates to an extreme level that is clearly out of proportion to the trigger in terms of anger, hate, and/or disgust. The misophonia sufferer usually believes their response is uncontrollable.'   snoring, wheezing, nose whistling and sniffling, to chewing with one's mouth open, talking with food in one's mouth, teeth grinding, loud throat clearing, and slurping."
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose misophonia?,"""Many health-care professionals, including psychiatrists, primary-care providers, audiologists, speech and language therapists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, physicians' assistants, and social workers may help make the diagnosis of misophonia. One of these professionals will likely conduct or refer the patient for an extensive medical interview and physical examination as part of the assessment. One of the key aspects of establishing the diagnosis of misophonia includes ruling out other hearing disorders, including age-related ""'hearing loss'', ''tinnitus'' (perception of sound due to abnormal hearing perception), hyperacusis (decreased tolerance to ordinary sounds in the environment), and auditory ''hallucinations'' (hearing things, often voices, that have no basis for perception).''This illness is sometimes associated with a number of other mental-health problems, like ''depression'', ''bipolar disorder'', ''obsessive compulsive disorder'' and other ''anxiety'"" disorders, obsessive compulsive personality disorder, the condition that used to be called Asperger's syndrome, as well as other ""'autism''-spectrum disorders. The distractibility that may be exhibited by misophonia sufferers may be misdiagnosed as, or co-occur with, ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD''). Therefore, the evaluator will likely screen for signs of ''depression'', ''manic'' ''depression'', ''anxiety'', behavioral disturbances, and other mental-health symptoms. The symptoms of misophonia may also be the result of a number of medical conditions or can be a side effect of various medications. For this reason, health-care professionals often perform routine laboratory tests during the initial evaluation to rule out other causes of symptoms. Occasionally, an X-ray, scan, or other imaging study may be needed. As part of this examination, the sufferer may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help disqualify other diagnoses.'  "
What is the treatment for misophonia? Is there a cure?,"'While there is no known specific cure for misophonia and little rigorous (controlled studies) research regarding effective treatments, there are a number of approaches that tend to be used with some apparent success. Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) entails teaching people with misophonia how to improve their ability to tolerate certain noises. Cognitive behavioral therapy involves changing the negative thoughts that may contribute to the patient\'s suffering. Another treatment involves adding background noise to the person\'s environment in an effort to help them ignore their triggers for negative reactions. Fans and ""white noise"" machines along with behind the ear noise generators are some such sources of increasing background noise. Since it is thought that this illness develops at least partly as the result of the misophonia sufferer developing a conditioned response to certain noises, an approach that has had some success is the process of deconditioning people with this disorder. Specifically, this form of treatment involves pairing a positive experience with the misophonia trigger.''A variety of medications have been tried to treat misophonia, including those that treat ''depression'' and ''anxiety'' (like ''fluoxetine'' [''Prozac''], ''sertraline'' [''Zoloft''], or ''escitalopram'' [''Lexapro'']), ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (for example, ''amphetamine and dextroamphetamine'' [''Adderall''], ''methylphenidate'' [''Concerta'' and ''Ritalin'']), and ''bipolar disorder'' (for example, ''lamotrigine'' [''Lamictal''] and ''divalproex'' sodium [''Depakote'']), as well as ''dietary supplements'' like ''vitamins'', ''minerals'', and ''fish oil''. However, medication is not usually used to treat this condition.'  "
What is the prognosis of misophonia? What are misophonia complications?,"'Complications of misophonia include that the sufferer may become defensive against certain situations, changing their life to avoid experiences that may trigger symptoms. That can result in avoiding socializing with friends or family members, even avoiding sleeping in the same room as a spouse. Those issues can eventually result in problems succeeding in relationships, school, or employment. Fortunately, research indicates that more than 80% of misophonia sufferers can experience significant relief from symptoms if treated.' "
Is it possible to prevent misophonia?,"'Since most of the theories about risk factors for misophonia seem to be biologically based, prevention usually focuses on trying to prevent complications of this disorder rather than the disorder itself.' "
Are there support groups for people with misophonia?,'Public Forum for Misophonia''http://misophonia.com' 
What are mitochondrial myopathies?,"'Mitochondrial myopathies are a group of neuromuscular diseases caused by damage to the mitochondria—small, energy-producing structures that serve as the cells\' ""power plants."" Nerve cells in the brain and muscles require a great deal of energy, and thus appear to be particularly damaged when mitochondrial dysfunction occurs. Some of the more common mitochondrial myopathies include Kearns-Sayre syndrome, myoclonus ''epilepsy'' with ragged-red fibers, and ''mitochondrial encephalomyopathy'' with lactic acidosis and ''stroke-like episodes''.' "
What are the symptoms of mitochondrial myopathies?,"'The symptoms of mitochondrial myopathies include muscle ''weakness'' or ''exercise'' intolerance, ''heart failure'' or rhythm disturbances, ''dementia'', movement disorders, ''stroke''-like episodes, deafness, ''blindness'', droopy eyelids, limited mobility of the eyes, ''vomiting'', and ''seizures''. The prognosis for these disorders ranges in severity from progressive weakness to death. Most mitochondrial myopathies occur before the age of 20, and often begin with ''exercise'' intolerance or muscle weakness. During physical activity, muscles may become easily fatigued or weak. Muscle cramping is rare, but may occur. ''Nausea'', ''headache'', and breathlessness are also associated with these disorders.'  "
Is there any treatment for mitochondrial disease?,"'Although there is no specific treatment for any of the mitochondrial myopathies, physical therapy may extend the range of movement of muscles and improve dexterity. Vitamin therapies such as riboflavin, coenzyme Q, and carnitine (a specialized amino acid) may provide subjective improvement in ''fatigue'' and energy levels in some patients.'  "
What is the prognosis for mitochondrial disease?,"'The prognosis for patients with mitochondrial myopathies varies greatly, depending largely on the type of disease and the degree of involvement of various organs. These disorders cause progressive weakness and can lead to death.'  "
What research is being done for mitochondrial disease?,"'The NINDS conducts and supports research on mitochondrial myopathies. The goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding of these disorders and to find ways to effectively treat, prevent, or potentially cure them.' "

"What is mitral valve prolapse? What causes it, and what does it look like (pictures)?","'Mitral valve prolapse (also known as ""click murmur syndrome"" and ""Barlow\'s syndrome"") is the most common heart valve abnormality. The condition is slightly more prevalent in women than in men. The mitral valve is one of the four heart valves. A normal mitral valve consists of two thin leaflets, located between the ''left atrium'' and the ''left ventricle'' of the heart. Mitral valve leaflets, shaped like parachutes, are attached to the inner wall of the left ventricle by a series of strings called ""chordae."" When the ventricles contract, the mitral valve leaflets close snugly and prevent the backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left ''atrium''. When the ventricles relax, the valves open to allow oxygenated blood from the ''lungs'' to fill the left ventricle.''In mitral valve prolapse, the mitral apparatus (valve leaflets and chordae) becomes affected by a process called myxomatous degeneration. In myxomatous degeneration, the structural protein collagen forms abnormally and causes thickening, enlargement, and redundancy of the leaflets and chordae. Blood normally flows through the mitral valve from the left upper chamber (left ''atrium'') to the left lower chamber (left ventricle) of the heart. When the ventricles contract, the redundant leaflets prolapse (flop backwards) into the left ''atrium'', sometimes allowing leakage of blood through the valve opening (''mitral regurgitation'') back into the left atrium. When severe, mitral regurgitation can lead to ''heart failure'' and ''abnormal heart rhythms''. Most people are unaware of the prolapsing of the mitral valve. However, others may experience a number of symptoms.''The mitral valve prolapse (MVP) syndrome has a strong hereditary tendency, although the exact cause is unknown. Affected family members are often tall, thin, with long arms and fingers, and straight backs. Mitral valve prolapse is more common in women from 20 to 40 years old; however, also occurs in men.''For reasons not clear, people with mild mitral valve prolapse often have more symptoms and signs than those with severe prolapse (which may require surgery). Rarely, people with severe mitral valve prolapse will have symptoms that can affect the entire body.' "
What are the sign and symptoms of mitral valve prolapse?,"'Most people with mitral valve prolapse have no symptoms, however, those who do commonly complain of symptoms may experience:''Often the severity of symptoms in people with ''mitral prolapse'' is inversely correlated to the degree of anatomic abnormality of the heart. Many people with severe symptoms have barely detectable prolapse, and the small minority with severe prolapse and valve dysfunction have no symptoms.'   Fatigue is the most common symptom of mitral valve prolapse, although the reason for fatigue is not understood. People with mitral valve prolapse may have imbalances in their autonomic nervous system, which regulates heart rate and breathing. These imbalances may cause inadequate blood oxygen delivery to the working muscles during exercise, thereby causing fatigue. Palpitations are sensations of fast or irregular heartbeats. In most people with mitral valve prolapse, palpitations are harmless. Rarely, potentially serious heart rhythm abnormalities may underlie palpitations and require further evaluation and treatment. Sharp chest pains, which can be prolonged. Unlike angina and chest pain, rarely, mitral valve prolapse occurs during or after exercise, and may not respond to nitroglycerin. Anxiety, panic attacks, and depression may be associated with mitral valve prolapse. Like fatigue, these symptoms are believed to be related to imbalances of the autonomic nervous system. Migraine headaches have been occasionally linked to mitral valve prolapse. The migraines are probably related to abnormal nervous system control of the tension in the blood vessels in the brain. Pulmonary edema usually occurs when fluid inside of the blood vessels of the lungs leak outside of the vessel, which causes swelling of the surrounding tissues."
What are the risk factors for mitral valve prolapse?,"'Risk factors that increase the risk for mitral valve prolapse include the following:' Age (over 50) Family history Certain diseases (Marfan syndrome, Graves' disease, for example) Alcohol Stimulants like caffeine Magnesium deficiency"
How is mitral valve prolapse diagnosed?,"'Examination of the patient reveals characteristic findings unique to mitral valve prolapse. Using a stethoscope, a clicking sound is heard soon after the ventricle begins to contract. This clicking is felt to reflect tightening of the abnormal valve leaflets against the pressure load of the left ventricle. If there is associated leakage (regurgitation) of blood through the abnormal valve opening, a ""whooshing"" sound (murmur) can be heard immediately following the clicking sound.''Echocardiography'' (''ultrasound'' imaging of the heart) is the most useful test for mitral valve prolapse. Echocardiography can measure the severity of prolapse and the degree of mitral regurgitation. It can also detect areas of infection on the abnormal valves. Valve infection is called ''endocarditis'' and is a very rare, but potentially serious complication of mitral valve prolapse. Echocardiography can also evaluate the effect of prolapse and regurgitation on the functioning of the muscles of the ventricles.''Abnormally rapid or irregular heart rhythms can occur in patients with mitral valve prolapse, causing palpitations. A 24-hour Holter monitor is a device that takes a continuous recording of the patient\'s heart rhythm as the patient carries on his/her daily activities. Abnormal rhythms occurring during the test period are captured and analyzed at a later date. If abnormal rhythms do not occur every day, the Holter recording may fail to capture the abnormal rhythms. These patients then can be fitted with a small ""event-recorder"" to be worn for up to several weeks. When the patient senses a palpitation, an event button can be pressed to record the heart rhythm prior to, during, and after the palpitations.''Abnormally rapid or irregular heart rhythms can occur in patients with mitral valve prolapse, causing palpitations. A 24-hour Holter monitor is a device that takes a continuous recording of the patient\'s heart rhythm as the patient carries on his/her daily activities. Abnormal rhythms that occur during the test period are captured on the device and then are analyzed later. If abnormal rhythms do not occur every day, the Holter recording may fail to capture the abnormal rhythms. These patients then can be fitted with a small ""event-recorder"" that can be worn for several weeks. When the patient senses a palpitation, an event button can be pressed to record the heart rhythm prior to, during, and after the palpitations.''The American Heart Association describes two types of recorders, looping memory monitors and symptom event monitors. Looping monitors are activated by pushing a button, and can be programed to record your ''EKG'' a few minutes before and after you push the button.''Event monitors can be put on your wrist or chest and will record your EKG, but will not record those few minutes before you activate it, like the looping memory monitor does. However, both can transmit your recorded EKG to a hospital or doctor‘s office.'  "
What is the treatment for mitral valve prolapse?,"'The majority of people with mitral valve prolapse have an excellent prognosis and need no treatment. For these individuals, routine examinations including echocardiograms every few years may suffice. Mitral regurgitation in patients with mitral valve prolapse can lead to heart failure, heart enlargement, and abnormal rhythms. Therefore, those patients with mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation often are evaluated annually.''A rare, but potentially serious complication of mitral valve prolapse is endocarditis (valve infection or valve leakage,); therefore, individuals with mitral valve prolapse usually are prescribed antibiotics prior to any procedure that can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream. Examples of procedures include routine dental work, minor surgery, and procedures that can traumatize body tissues such as ''colonoscopy'' or gynecologic or urologic examinations. Examples of antibiotics used include oral ''amoxicillin'' and ''erythromycin'' as well as intramuscular or intravenous ''ampicillin'', gentamycin, and ''vancomycin''.''People with severe prolapse, abnormal heart rhythms, ''fainting'' spells, significant palpitations, chest ''pain'', and ''anxiety'' attacks may need medication. ''Beta-blockers'', such as ''atenolol'' (''Tenormin''), ''metoprolol'' (''Lopressor''), and ''propranolol'' (''Inderal''), are the ''drugs'' of choice. These act by increasing the size of the left ventricle, thereby reducing the degree of prolapse. The calcium blockers ''verapamil'' (''Calan'') and ''diltiazem'' (''Cardizem'') are useful in people who cannot tolerate beta-blockers.'  "
Mitral valve prolapse surgery,"'Although most patients with mitral valve prolapse require no treatment or treatment with oral medications, the prognosis is usually good. Rarely, surgery for mitral valve replacement or repair may be require. People who require surgery usually have severe mitral regurgitation causing worsening heart failure and progressive heart enlargement. Rarely, rupture of one or more chordae can cause sudden, severe mitral regurgitation and heart failure requiring surgical repair.''Mitral valve repair is preferable, if possible, to mitral valve replacement as the surgical treatment for mitral valve regurgitation. After mitral valve replacement, lifelong blood thinning medications are necessary to prevent blood from clotting on the artificial valves. After mitral valve repair, these blood-thinning medications are unnecessary. Due to the success of valve repair, it is being performed earlier in people with mitral regurgitation, thus reducing the risk of abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure, and death.' "
What are the complications of mitral valve prolapse?,"'Often the severity of symptoms in patients with mitral prolapse is inversely correlated to the degree of anatomic abnormality. Many patients with severe symptoms have barely detectable prolapse, and the small minority with severe prolapse and valve dysfunction have no symptoms.' Palpitations are sensations of fast or irregular heartbeats. In most patients with mitral valve prolapse, palpitations are harmless. In very rare cases, potentially serious heart rhythm abnormalities (for example, atrial fibrillation) may underlie palpitations and require further evaluation and treatment. Moreover, pulmonary hypertension may develop and lead to heart failure. Sharp chest pains are reported in some patients with mitral valve prolapse, which can be prolonged. Unlike angina, chest pain with mitral valve prolapse rarely occurs during or after exercise, and may not respond to nitroglycerin. Anxiety, panic attacks, and depression may be associated with mitral valve prolapse. Like fatigue, these symptoms are believed to be related to imbalances of the autonomic nervous system. Migraine headaches have been occasionally linked to mitral valve prolapse. They are probably related to abnormal nervous system control of the tension in the blood vessels in the brain. Mitral valve prolapse may be rarely associated with strokes occurring in young people. These patients appear to have increased blood clotting tendencies due to abnormally sticky blood clotting elements, called platelets."
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for mitral valve prolapse?,"'Although some people with mitral valve prolapse may experience a variety of complications, most have no symptoms and can lead healthy, active, and normal lives. More importantly, the overwhelming majority of people with mitral valve prolapse have bothersome symptoms, but not life-threatening problems. Rarely, a person may need surgery or other aggressive therapies. Moreover, the symptoms may be very episodic, and come in waves and then disappear for some time. Symptoms of mitral valve prolapse may be aggravated by ''pregnancy'', ''stress'', pregnancy, fatigue, menstrual cycles (''menstruation''), or other illnesses.''Life expectancy for people with mitral valve prolapse usually is normal, which includes young people that require surgery. People that develop complications from the condition or have other medical problems may have a reduced life expectancy related to the complication.' "
What are connective tissues?,"'The connective tissues are the structural portions of our body that essentially hold the cells of the body together. These tissues form a framework or matrix for the body. The connective tissues are composed of two major structural molecules, collagen and elastin. There are many different collagen proteins that vary in amount in each tissue of the body. Elastin is another protein that has the capability of stretching and returning to original length like a spring. Elastin is the major component of ligaments (tissues which attach bone to bone).''Connective tissue diseases are disorders featuring abnormalities involving the collagen and elastin. Connective tissue diseases are often characterized by a variety of immune abnormalities that are common for each particular type of illness.' "
What diseases characteristically affect connective tissue?,"'Diseases of connective tissue that are strictly inheritable (due to genetic inheritance) include ''Marfan syndrome'' (can have tissue abnormalities in the ''heart'', ''aorta'', ''lungs'', eyes, and skeleton) and ''Ehlers-Danlos syndrome'' (may have loose, fragile skin or loose [hyperextensible] joints). ''Pseudoxanthoma elasticum'' is an ''inherited'' disorder of elastin.''Other diseases of connective tissue do not have specific gene abnormalities as their sole cause. These connective tissue diseases occur for unknown reasons. They are characterized as a group by the presence of spontaneous overactivity of the immune system, which results in the production of unusual antibodies in the blood.''The classic immune-related connective tissue diseases include ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''scleroderma'', ''polymyositis'', and ''dermatomyositis''. Each of these diseases has a characteristic presentation with typical clinical findings that doctors can recognize during an examination. Each also has characteristic blood test abnormalities and abnormal antibody patterns. However, each of these diseases can evolve slowly or rapidly from very subtle abnormalities before demonstrating the classic features that help in the diagnosis. When these conditions have not developed the classic features of a particular disease, doctors will often refer to the condition as ""undifferentiated connective tissue disease."" This implies that the characteristic features that are used to define the classic connective tissue disease are not present, but some symptoms or signs of connective disease exist. Individuals with undifferentiated connective tissue disease may never develop a fully definable condition or they may eventually develop a classic connective tissue disease.' "
What is mixed connective tissue disease?,"'Mixed connective tissue disease, as first described in 1972, is ""classically"" considered an ""overlap"" of three diseases, systemic ''lupus'' erythematosus, scleroderma, and polymyositis. Patients with this pattern illness have features of each of these three diseases. They also typically have very high quantities of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and antibodies to ribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP) detectable in their blood. The symptoms of many of these patients eventually evolve to become dominated by features of one of three component illnesses, most commonly scleroderma. Mixed connective tissue disease is often abbreviated MCTD.''It is now known that overlap syndromes can occur that involve any combination of the connective tissue diseases. Therefore, for example, patients can have a combination of ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and systemic ''lupus'' erythematosus (hence, the coined name ""rhupus"").' "
What are causes and risk factors for mixed connective tissue disease?,'The most significant causes and risk factors for developing mixed connective tissue disease are certain gene patterns that are inherited from ancestors. There is no known environmental toxin that has been shown to cause mixed connective tissue disease.' 
What are signs and symptoms of mixed connective tissue disease?,"'The signs and symptoms of mixed connective tissue disease vary greatly from one individual affected to another. If polymyositis is the dominant feature, muscle ''weakness'' is prominent. If systemic ''lupus'' erythematosus prevails, there may be ''chest pain'' with ''breathing'', ''kidney disease'', and/or ''arthritis'' of the joints. If scleroderma symptoms dominate, there can be diffuse swelling and thickening of the fingers and ''feet'' with bluish discoloration of the fingers after ''cold'' exposure ('""Raynaud's""' phenomenon).'  "
What types of doctors treat mixed connective tissue disease?,"'Doctors who treat patients with mixed connective tissue disease include primary-care providers such as general practitioners, internists, and family medicine doctors. Other specialists who can be involved in the care for these patients include neurologists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, and nephrologists. Specialists with a particular interest in mixed connective tissue disease are ''rheumatologists''.' "
How do doctors diagnose mixed connective tissue disease?,"'Today, true mixed connective tissue disease is diagnosed when patients demonstrate the clinical features (exam findings) of overlap illnesses (as described above) and have high amounts of the antibodies ANA and anti-RNP in their blood. Mixed connective tissue disease patients do not typically have antibodies such as dsDNA and Scl70, which are particularly common in systemic ''lupus'' erythematosus and scleroderma respectively.' "
What are treatment options for mixed connective tissue disease?,"'The treatment of mixed connective tissue disease is based on which features are causing symptoms and signs. The prognosis (outlook) varies accordingly. Therapies must be targeted for each of the organ systems affected. In general, treatment is often directed at suppressing the inflammation present in the tissues by using anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive medications. These medications include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''), cortisone drugs/steroids (such as ''prednisone''), antimalarial drugs (''hydroxychloroquine''), and cytotoxic drugs (such as ''methotrexate'', ''azathioprine'', and ''cyclophosphamide''). Organ damage, such as in the kidneys, can require additional treatments directed at ''high blood pressure'', etc.''For the joint and muscle pains of mixed connective tissue disease, treatment options including NSAIDs, low-dose prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate can be helpful. Sometimes TNF blockers ''infliximab'' (''Remicade''), ''etanercept'' (''Enbrel''), or ''adalimumab'' (''Humira'') are considered for inflammatory arthritis. Physical therapy for certain joints is sometimes helpful. For ''pulmonary hypertension'', medications that tend to open the arteries to the lungs are used along with blood-thinning drugs and even supplemental oxygen. For ''interstitial lung disease'', prednisone and cyclophosphamide are considered. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, such as ''captopril'' (''Capoten'') and ''enalapril'' (''Vasotec''), are used to prevent damage to the kidneys, especially if ''blood pressure'' is elevated. ''Esophagus'' irritation and ''heartburn'' can be prevented by elevating the head of the bed and can be relieved with ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec'') or ''lansoprazole'' (''Prevacid''). Antacids can also be helpful. ''Constipation'', cramping, and ''diarrhea'' are sometimes caused by bacteria that can be treated with ''tetracycline'' or ''erythromycin''.''For '""Raynaud's""' phenomenon, patients are recommended to use hand- and body-warming techniques while protecting the fingers from injury. ''Nifedipine'' (''Procardia''), ''losartan'' (''Cozaar'', ''Hyzaar''), and ''nitroglycerin'' cream are used to dilate the constricted blood vessels. Severe RP can lead to ''gangrene'' and the loss of digits. In rare cases of severe disease, nerve surgery called ""sympathectomy"" is sometimes considered. In order to prevent blood vessel constriction, the nerves that stimulate the constriction of the vessels (sympathetic nerves) are surgically interrupted. Usually, this is performed during an operation that is localized to the sides of the base of the fingers at the hand. Through small incisions the tiny nerves around the blood vessels are stripped away. This procedure is referred to as a digital sympathectomy.'  "
What are home remedies for mixed connective tissue disease?,"'Gastroesophageal reflux disease'"" in mixed connective tissue disease can be helped by elevation of the head of the bed and taking stomach acid-blocking medications. Raynaud's phenomenon can be helped by general body warming and wearing gloves to prevent chilling."" "
What is the prognosis of mixed connective tissue disease?,'The outlook for mixed connective tissue disease very much depends on the location and intensity of the organs affected. Those who are treated and monitored early tend to have better outcomes.' 
Is it possible to prevent mixed connective tissue disease?,'No. There is no ''prevention'' for mixed connective tissue disease.' 
Are there support groups for mixed connective tissue disease?,'See the local chapter of the Arthritis Foundation for information about support groups.' 
What is Mohs surgery?,"'Mohs surgery, also referred to as Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), is a special technique that utilizes both pathology and surgery to remove ''skin cancers'"" in a physician's office. Tissue containing the ""'tumor'' is frozen on a cryostat, and very thin horizontal slices of tissue are cut from the bottom-most layers of the skin tumor, positioned on a glass slide, and stained by a technician. The physician then examines these thin layers under a microscope. A dermatologist removes and examines repeated saucer-shaped layers of tissue until no more ''skin cancer'' is visible, only healthy tissue.''The procedure includes special dyes that allow the surgeon to remove the entire ''malignancy'' using a tumor map showing the sites of any residual ''cancer'"" cells. During MMS there is an examination of the entire tumor's margins simultaneously while the patient is waiting. If more ""'cancer'' cells are seen under the microscope, tissue is removed at those sites of involvement. Each skin layer that is removed is called a ""level."" If no more ''cancer'' cells are seen at a particular level, then it is deemed ""clear"" (no more tumor) and no additional levels are removed.''By removing only tissue where cancer is known to be present, the technique combines a very high cure rate with excellent preservation of normal skin. Once the cancer has been fully removed, the surgeon will determine the type of repair for the best cosmetic result. The surgeon may refer patients to another physician for ''wound'' closure, may close the wound immediately, or may let the wound heal on its own.''MMS is special because the entire edge and under-surface of each ''skin cancer'"" layer is microscopically examined for the presence of cancer cells. Traditional surgical pathology techniques use\xa0vertical sections (bread loafing) and are only helpful to evaluate 1%-3% of the tumor margins, thereby increasing the chances that a small tumor cluster may be missed and left behind. MMS enables the examination of 100% of the entire tumor's margin, thereby reducing the chance of recurrence of the ""'skin cancer''.''MMS surgery is significantly more ''labor'' intensive than conventional methods of ''skin cancer'' treatment, and as a result, it is more expensive. This type of surgery is typically reserved only for certain situations, which include recurrent ''cancers'' that have not been cured by conventional techniques, large tumors with indistinct margins, tumors that occur in cosmetically sensitive areas like the mid-facial tissues, and scarring basal cell cancers, which are known to have a high recurrence rate.''MMS is scheduled with the understanding that the patient may be spending the entire day in the office depending on the number of levels necessary to clear the tumor. Most of these procedures are performed with the patient in the waiting room awaiting the verdict from the Mohs surgeon.' "
Why is the procedure called Mohs?,"'Mohs is named after its inventor, Dr. Frederic Mohs, who first described the technique in 1941. He originally used fixed stained tissue and patients were frequently required to spend more than one day for successful treatment. This unique technique made it possible to examine horizontal pieces of tissue from the deepest portion of the specimen while at the same time visualizing the outside edges of the tumor in the same block of tissue.' "
Where can I have Mohs surgery? How long does Mohs surgery take?,"""Mohs micrographic surgery is usually performed in an outpatient setting, such as in a doctor's office, using local anesthetic (""'lidocaine''). Sometimes the procedure may be performed in an outpatient surgical center with the assistance of an anesthesiologist. Rarely, it is performed in an inpatient hospital setting.'""You are generally in the medical office for several hours on the day of your Mohs procedure. Depending on the size and depth of the skin cancer, more than a single level may be required to achieve clearance. MMS requires your patience and your doctor's careful effort and skill. It is not always possible to predict ahead of time how many hours your specific procedure will take. Most patients leave their day's schedule open to allow for adequate time to complete their Mohs procedures."" "
What kind of physician can perform Mohs surgery? Where can I find a doctor board-certified in Mohs?,"'Most Mohs surgeons are specially trained dermatologists. There are also some ''plastic surgery'' and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeons who are also trained to perform Mohs.''There is no current board certification for Mohs surgery. There are two nationally recognized MMS specialty groups, the American College of Mohs Micrographic Surgery and Cutaneous ''Oncology'' and the American Society for Mohs Surgery.' "
Is Mohs only for skin cancer?,"'Yes, Mohs is a widely used method of removing the most common types of nonmelanoma skin cancers, including ''basal cell carcinoma'' and ''squamous cell carcinoma''. Less frequently, Mohs may also be used for other ''malignant'' tumors. In special cases, Mohs may be used to treat ''malignant melanoma'', ''lentigo'' maligna, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, ''Merkel cell carcinoma'', microcystic adnexal ''carcinoma'', malignant trichoepithelioma, angiosarcoma, atypical fibroxanthoma, and other cancerous skin tumors.'  "
Am I a good candidate for Mohs surgery?,"'You may not be a good candidate for Mohs if you are unable to tolerate local anesthesia, have extreme ''anxiety'', have a surgical ''phobia'', or are in very poor health.''The best treatment choice depends on various factors, including location, type of skin cancer, past treatments, and one’s overall health. Your physician can help you sort through the different options and assist in your choice. The right decision is a very personal one.' "
What if I have artificial joints or other health issues?,"'Your surgeon needs to know of any underlying medical conditions that may affect your surgery or wound healing. You would want to be certain to tell your surgeon beforehand if you have any artificial parts (implants) like knees or hips, a ''pacemaker'' or ''defibrillator'', or need to take antibiotics before dental procedures because of a ''heart'' condition or murmur.''Your surgeon needs to know if you have had a history of ''staph'' or other skin infections in the recent past. You may be asked to wash with a special antibiotic soap or wash like chlorhexidine (Hibiclens) the night or morning before surgery to help reduce the number of bacteria on your skin.''Patients need to also advise their surgeon of any drug ''allergies'' to anesthetics like lidocaine (''Xylocaine'') or procaine (Novocaine). Additionally, the surgeon may need to know of any bleeding or ''bruising'' tendencies, ''hepatitis'', ''HIV/AIDS'', or ''pregnancy''.' "
What areas are treatable by Mohs surgery?,"'Although any skin site is amenable to MMS, it is used primarily for the treatment of head and neck basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). It is particularly useful for skin cancers in difficult areas such as nose, lips, and ears, where it is important to remove a minimal amount of uninvolved tissue.''It is also useful on hands and ''feet'' in order to minimize scarring. MMS is very effective for the treatment of recurrent tumors (tumors that were previously removed and have regrown at the same site). However, depending on the specific patient and tumor type, any area of the body may be treated by Mohs surgery.' "
What are possible complications of Mohs?,"'As with any surgery or procedure, Mohs is associated with possible risks and complications. While it is overall a very safe and effective surgical treatment, there are some possible uncommon complications. Since a ''scar'' forms anytime you cut the skin, most patients understand and can expect some type of a scar after skin-cancer removal.''Possible risks and complications of MMS are no different from those in conventional surgical procedures and include (but are not limited to) bleeding, ''bruising'', wound infection, ''pain'', unsightly scar, ''keloid'' (raised, thick scar), cosmetic disfigurement, skin discoloration, nerve damage, ''allergic'' reactions, ''pain'', reaction to local anesthesia, wound opening (dehiscence) and splitting or retained ''stitches'', cancer recurrence, need for further surgery or treatment including ''radiation'' or ''plastic'' surgery, and very rarely death.''Minor, serious, or life-threatening side effects can occur with the use of anesthetics or with medications given before, after, or during surgery. Nerves controlling muscle movement, sensation, or other functions may be damaged. This nerve damage may be permanent. Overall, most patients tolerate the surgery very well without any complications.' "
What is reconstruction? Will I have a scar after Mohs surgery?,"'Reconstruction is repairing or fixing the wound produced after removal of the malignant skin tumor. This procedure is not different than any treatment performed after any conventional surgical procedure performed on skin. Repairing or closing the wound may involve having your surgeon stitch the wound closed side by side. Sometimes an area may heal best by letting the wound heal by itself naturally without stitches. Additional reconstruction options include using a skin graft or moving a flap of skin. Shared decision-making is very important with this issue, and it can help if you are involved by reviewing how you prefer to repair the wound.''The main goal with Mohs surgery is to remove the skin cancer in its entirety. Once the cancer is removed, then your surgeon will look at options of how to best repair the wound producing the optimum cosmetic result. The goal of MMS is to clear skin cancer, achieve the smallest scar, and preserve the maximum amount of normal tissue. Since all MMS procedures produce ''scars'' it may be necessary to consider options like lasers, scar creams and gels, and cortisone injections depending on the healing process. However, do not expect these treatments to completely remove the scar.''In summary, there are two parts of the procedure. The first part is the removal of the entire tumor by cutting out and examining horizontal stained frozen sections of tissue. The second portion of the procedure is the repair of the wound. Depending on a variety of factors, the wound could be reconstructed by the physician who performed the original MMS procedure, by a second surgeon (plastic or ENT), or the wound could be allowed to heal on its own (secondary intention).'  "
What about insurance coverage and costs of Mohs surgery?,"'Mohs surgery is generally considered a medical service and is not considered cosmetic. Currently, most insurance plans cover the procedure under their provided benefits. However, with the many changes in insurance plans, it is always advisable to contact your insurance carrier prior to scheduling surgery and confirm your eligibility and benefits.''Mohs, like any surgical procedure, will result in additional procedure charges above the routine office-visit fees. These surgical fees may range from $1,000-$3,000 depending on the area, number of levels, and the type of closure or repair required. The greater the number of levels required, the higher the cost. Surgical centers and hospitals usually have\xa0much greater costs associated with a facility fee in addition to the surgery fee.''Insurance benefits vary and reimbursement depends on what benefits you have contracted for with your company. Currently, Medicare generally covers 80% of Mohs cancer surgery. If you have a secondary insurance plan, that may help take care of the remainder 20% not covered by Medicare.''Commercial or non-Medicare insurance generally cover a large percentage of the surgical cost, not including any deductible expense.' "
What are alternatives for Mohs surgery?,"'It is important to understand that there are alternative treatments and options to Mohs. Additional treatment choices include (but are not limited to) local radiation, plastic surgery, curettage and desiccation (scrape and ''burn''), regular excisional surgery, cryosurgery (deep freezing), and ''photodynamic therapy'' (uses a type of light and a light-activated chemical called a photosensitizer).' "
How do I prepare for my Mohs surgery?,"'Your personal physician will give you the preoperative instructions specific for your condition.''Smoking'' is discouraged for at least one to two weeks before surgery. ''Smoking'' can slow wound healing and cause more wound infections.''Heavy ''alcohol'' use is not advised at least one week before surgery. Heavy alcohol use can cause more bleeding and thin your blood. An occasional glass of wine or small cocktail may not cause severe bleeding. Your physician will want to know of any factors that may affect your surgery or wound healing.''Since the duration of the procedure is not known, most patients are advised to eat a good breakfast on the day of surgery and take all of their regular daily medications. Patients are advised to wear comfortable casual clothes and bring a sweater or small blanket. In most cases, patients are able to drive after most procedures and do not necessarily need a driver unless they feel uncomfortable. Diabetic patients may need to be more cautious about maintaining good blood sugars and avoiding dangerous lows in their sugars from fasting. Bring some personal snacks, ''drinks'', and reading or knitting material. Personal music headsets or iPods may also provide relaxation and help pass time.''For surgery center or hospital-based procedures requiring any type of sedation or general anesthesia, patients may be required to not eat or drink anything past midnight the night before surgery. Your surgeon or anesthesiologist will advise you of specific instructions before surgery.''Most patients continue all doctor prescribed medications including ''aspirin'' and any blood-thinning medication unless specifically advised otherwise only by the primary physician or plastic or Mohs surgeon. Patients with a significant history of ''stroke'', ''heart attacks'', or even heart pain (''angina'"") under a doctor's care must discuss their medications with their doctor before making any changes. It is important to not discontinue blood thinners without a doctor's specific instructions because of a potential greater risk of a ""'heart attack'' and/or ''stroke''.''For otherwise healthy individuals (non-cardiac and non-''stroke'' patients), nonessential, nonmedically prescribed medications that thin the blood -- such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin''), aspirin, ''vitamin E'', ''garlic'' ''supplements'', Alka-Seltzer, ''Pepto-Bismol'"", other aspirin-containing medications, etc. --\xa0can be stopped at least seven to 14 days before undergoing Mohs surgery to minimize bleeding and bruising. These medications can thin your blood and make you more prone to bleed during and after surgery. Again, it is important to not discontinue or start any medication without a doctor's specific instruction."" "
What is the recovery time for Mohs surgery? Is Mohs painful?,"'Recovery is usually very easy and uneventful. Overall, resting as much as possible the first few days after surgery is helpful.''Stitches (''sutures'"") are usually removed at the surgeon's office anywhere from four to 14 days from the date of surgery. Your physician will let you know what date to return for stitch removal.""'Most patients report minimal discomfort after surgery and require minimal or no pain medication.''If there is pain, many patients find that they prefer to take something for pain at the first hint of discomfort instead of waiting until the pain builds up to an unbearable level. If you have mild or moderate pain, your doctor may advise you to take ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or another ''pain reliever'' over the counter. Aspirin or aspirin-containing pain relievers may cause increased bleeding. Rarely, prescription pain medications may be required for severe pain.''Your physician will let you know what pain medications are recommended for your specific condition.''Most patients are able to return to work or school the next day after Mohs. Avoiding heavy lifting, straining, or strenuous ''exercise'' for seven to 21 days may be required depending on the area of surgery. Your physician will need to let you know what activity precautions are required based on the area and size of your procedure.''You may go out in the sun with ''sunscreen'"" and protective hats and clothing. Excess sun exposure has been linked to skin cancer. Use of sunscreen or other cover-up on the scar is very helpful for at least six months after surgery to help minimize scarring. It is important to follow your own physician's instructions for ""'wound care'' and ''sun protection''.'  "
How do I take care of my surgical area after Mohs surgery?,"'It is recommended to check with your surgeon for specific postoperative wound care instructions. Often, you will be asked to go home and take it easy for the rest of the day. A few patients like to return to work and resume their work the day after surgery. It may be advisable to avoid heavy lifting and ''exercise'', especially the first 24-48 hours after surgery. Your physician will usually give you more detailed instructions depending on the area and size of the surgery. You will have usually have a bulky ""pressure"" dressing on the surgery area for one day. You may be asked to keep the area dry for 24 hours. ''Swimming'' pools, oceans, and Jacuzzis are usually not permitted while the stitches are in. These may increase your chance of infection. Many physicians allow you to shower the next day after surgery. Wound care may require cleaning the wound with soap or hydrogen peroxide two to three times a day and applying petroleum jelly to the area. Mild swelling is not uncommon the first day or two after surgery and can be lessened by use of an ice-bag application, ice cubes or chips in a small Ziploc baggie, or frozen peas in the bag. Leaving the dressing in place, use ''cold'' pack application every five to 15 minutes every hour for the first eight to 24 hours after surgery. Swelling is more common for surgeries around the eyes or lips. Sleeping propped up on a few pillows or in a reclining chair may help decrease swelling after surgery of the head and face area.''The surgical area may ooze a little blood or clear liquid especially in the first few hours after surgery; activity may aggravate this. Hot drinks or bending over at the waist can also initiate or worsen bleeding of face wounds. If bleeding occurs, firm pressure applied directly to the site for 10-15 minutes may be helpful. Most bleeding will stop if you apply enough pressure. Your surgeon should be notified if bleeding persists. Rarely, a visit to the hospital emergency room may be necessary for severe bleeding.''Your surgeon will need to know if pain is increasing after one to two days after your surgery or if you are having ''fever'"" or other concerning symptoms. In such cases, you may need to be seen at the surgeon's office. The surgical area may need to be checked for bleeding or infection. Limiting hot foods, hot drinks, and heavy chewing for 48 hours may help decrease the chances of postoperative bleeding for wounds around the mouth or cheek areas. Your physician will explain recommended wound care.""'Most patients are advised to try to avoid applying ''makeup'"" or powder directly on a fresh wound unless the surface is fully healed. Skin-colored tape strips called Steri Strips are available to minimize wound leakage and help cover up a visible wound. It is important to follow your physician's instructions for wound care."" "
What is the chance that my cancer will recur after Mohs surgery?,"'There is a very low chance that your skin cancer will recur after Mohs surgery. Cure rates have been reported as high as 96%-99%.''It is important to understand that no cancer treatment or surgery has a 100% cure rate. A skin cancer may recur or a new cancer may arise in the same or adjacent area even after Mohs or other surgery. Some skin cancers are more aggressive than others and need additional treatment and closer follow-up. Skin cancers frequently need additional follow-up and possible further treatment. Although MMS surgery tends to have the highest cure rate compared to other treatments, it may need to be supplemented by radiation or further surgery. Follow-up appointments with your physician are very important, especially in the first few years after surgery. Many patients are seen every four to six months after their diagnosis of a skin cancer. Monthly self-examinations of the skin are good practice for patients with a history of skin cancer. Any changing or new growth should be promptly checked by your physician. More regular follow-up appointments may be needed for those with more aggressive tumors or tumors in high-risk areas.' "
"How many ""levels"" of Mohs 
surgery will I need?","'On average, most patients may only need one or two levels before clearing the tumor. Depending on the skin cancer type and location, a patient may need anywhere from one to 10 or more levels to clear a tumor.''There is very little way to predict beforehand how large a skin cancer is because often there are invisible portions that can be seen only with the help of a microscope. Sometimes, more than one surgical procedure may be required to remove very large or invasive tumors, cancers in small areas or difficult areas, or to obtain the best medical and cosmetic result.' "
What are treatment options for skin cancers?,"'There are many effective ways to treat skin cancers. Options include local radiation (X-ray) treatments, curettage and desiccation ""C&D"" (scrape and ''burn''), cryosurgery (specialized deep freezing), photodynamic therapy using Levulan and laser and or blue light, regular surgical excision, laser removal and surgery, Mohs surgery, and several prescription creams, including imiquimod (''Aldara'') and fluorouracil (''Efudex'').' "
What is mold?,"'Molds are various types of fungi (singular = fungus) that grow in filaments and reproduce by forming spores that can travel through the air. The term ''mildew'' refers to some kinds of mold, particularly mold in the home with a white or grayish color or mold growing in shower stalls and bathrooms. Mold may grow indoors or outdoors and thrives in damp, warm, and humid environments. Mold exists in essentially any environment or season.''The most common types of household mold found indoors include ''Cladosporium'', ''Penicillium'', ''Alternaria'', and ''Aspergillus''. ''Stachybotrys'' chartarum'' (also known as ''Stachybotrys atra'' and sometimes referred to as ""black mold"") is a greenish-black indoor mold, although it is less common than the other types of mold found in homes. Black mold\xa0grows on household surfaces that have high cellulose content, such as wood, fiberboard, gypsum board, paper, dust, and lint. There are types of mold that can grow on substances as different as foods and carpet.''Molds reproduce by forming tiny spores that are not visible to the naked eye. Mold spores are very hardy and can survive under conditions in which mold cannot grow, such as in dry and harsh environments. These spores travel through outdoor and indoor air. When the mold spores in the air land on a surface where moisture is present, mold can then start to grow.''Outdoors, molds play a role in the decomposition of organic material such as dead trees, compost, and leaves. They are most common in damp, dark areas or areas of decomposing plant life. People often find mold indoors in basements or shower stalls. Indoor mold in residential areas has the potential to cause health problems and can destroy surfaces and objects where it grows.' "
What are symptoms and signs of mold exposure?,"'Molds produce irritating substances that may act as ''allergy'' causing substances (allergens) in sensitive individuals. Furthermore, some molds produce toxic substances known as mycotoxins, but mold itself is not poisonous or toxic. The term ""toxic mold,"" therefore, refers to the fact that certain kinds of mold can produce mycotoxins. The conditions under which some molds produce toxins is not understood, and the presence of mold, even a mold that is capable of producing toxins, does not always imply that toxins are being produced or that a health risk or problem is present. Mold may not cause any health problems, or it may lead to ''allergy'' or other symptoms in people, including adults and children, who are sensitive to molds.''Allergic reactions to mold are the most common health effects of mold and are therefore the greatest health risk related to mold. Allergic reactions may happen immediately or develop after a period following exposure. Both growing mold and mold spores may lead to allergic reactions. Symptoms and signs of mold ''allergy'' may include''Mold or mold spores may cause ''asthma'' attacks in people who have ''asthma'' and are allergic to mold. Even in some nonallergic individuals, mold can cause symptoms of irritation in the eyes, skin, and airways. For example, the ""black mold"" ''Stachybotrys'', along with some other types of mold, produces toxins known as mycotoxins that can cause irritation of the skin and airways in susceptible individuals.''Sometimes, people may develop severe reactions to mold exposure. Symptoms of severe reactions, which are uncommon, include ''fever'' and difficulty ''breathing''. People with compromised immune systems or patients with chronic lung disease can develop serious infections of the ''lungs'' due to molds.''It is not possible to predict the degree of severity of the health risks associated with mold in the home. Allergic individuals vary in their degree of susceptibility to mold, and any symptoms and health risks also depend upon the extent and exact type of mold that is present.''In 2004 guidelines update in 2009, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reported there was sufficient evidence to link indoor exposure to mold with upper respiratory tract symptoms, ''cough'', and wheezing in otherwise healthy people, although the report stated that was no evidence that mold causes medical conditions like ''asthma'', ''bronchitis'', or other respiratory conditions. Mold also worsens ''asthma symptoms'' in people who have asthma. Mold was also reported to be linked to ''hypersensitivity pneumonitis'' in individuals susceptible to this immunologic condition. This uncommon disease is similar to ''pneumonia'' and can develop in susceptible individuals after brief or prolonged exposure to mold, but there has been no conclusive evidence to prove this relationship.' sneezing, runny nose, coughing, wheezing, watery eyes, redness of the eyes, itchy eyes, skin irritation, or rash."
Where does mold grow in homes?,"'Although bathrooms (particularly shower stalls) and basements are typical moist areas prone to mold growth, any moist area in the home can be moldy. Drywall, ceiling tiles, carpets, furniture, ductwork, roofing, paneling, wallpaper, under sinks, and the areas around plumbing pipes are examples of areas in the home that can harbor mold if the ideal growing conditions are present.''Mold spores from the outdoor air can enter the home through open doors, windows, and vents. It may also become attached to clothing, shoes, and pets and therefore be carried indoors.''Mold can have many different colors (including brown, green, and black) and sometimes appears as spots. Additionally, a musty odor may be present. Mold growth may hide underneath carpeting, on the backside of wallpaper, and behind drywall or wall paneling. Mold thrives in saunas, greenhouses, and construction areas.'  "
What kind of mold grows on food?,"'Many different types of molds can grow on food. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the types of mold that can be found in foods include ''Alternaria'', ''Aspergillus'', ''Botrytis'', ''Cladosporium'', ''Fusarium'', ''Geotrichum'', ''Monilia'', ''Manoscus'', ''Mortierella'', ''Mucor'', ''Neurospora'', ''Oidium'', ''Oosproa'', ''Penicillium'', ''Rhizopus'', and ''Thamnidium''. Certain kinds of cheeses are made with mold, like brie, gorgonzola, stilton, roquefort, and camembert. The mold that is part of the food manufacturing process is safe and does not pose health risks. It is also normal for dry-cured country ham and hard salami to have surface mold. The USDA has a helpful online resource that can show you what molds in food are safe and how to handle moldy foods.' "
Is there a treatment  that cures mold?,'The treatment for allergic reactions to mold is the same as the treatment for allergic reactions in general. ''Fungal infections'' that spread throughout the body that occur in people with weakened immune systems are typically treated in the hospital with special antifungal ''drugs'' and other measures to support breathing and circulation. Treatment of underlying conditions such as asthma is described in the article on asthma and depends on the severity type of symptoms the individual experiences.' 
How do you remove mold from you home?,"'Mold clean up procedures are somewhat dependent upon the extent of the problem and the type of surface contamination. Large areas of mold in a building may require the services of a professional contractor skilled in mold remediation and removal. Scrub hard surfaces, such as walls, that harbor mold with detergent and water, and these should be dried completely. Discard porous or absorbent materials (such as cloth, ceiling tiles, carpets, etc.) if they become moldy. In some cases, it may be necessary to use a dilute solution of chlorine bleach (no stronger than 1 cup of bleach in 1 gallon of water) or stronger commercial cleaners to kill and remove the mold.''Be sure to discuss any health problem with a health care professional prior to attempting to remove and clean mold if you have an allergy or are sensitive to molds. Use rubber gloves when washing with soap and water, but for bleach and harsher cleaning agents, nonporous gloves (for example, natural rubber, neoprene, nitrile, polyurethane, or ''PVC'') should be worn along with protective ''eyewear''. Wearing an N-95 respirator (available at many hardware stores) can further limit exposure to airborne mold or spores when cleaning. Avoid touching moldy surfaces with bare hands.''After mold removal, it is important to prevent further growth of mold by keeping affected areas as dry as possible.'  "
How can you prevent mold in your home?,"'The best way to prevent mold in the home is the control of moisture. Although it is impossible to eliminate all mold spores in an indoor environment, the mold spores will not grow in the absence of moisture, so controlling moisture is the key to preventing mold growth.'   It's important to identify and repair water problems, such as leaks in plumbing or other structures that lead to moisture buildup. Clean and dry areas of leakage and water damage in the home within 24-48 hours to prevent mold problems. Use of an air conditioner or air dehumidifier during humid seasons can help reduce the potential for moisture buildup. Avoid the use of carpets in humid basements and bathrooms. Using fans and maintaining good ventilation in the home can also improve indoor air quality and help prevent or control dampness. Add mold inhibitor products to household paints. Keep indoor humidity levels low (ideally between 30%-50%). Use bathroom fans or open bathroom windows when showering for air circulation. Vent appliances that produce moisture, such as clothes dryers and stoves, to the outdoors when possible. Adding insulation can reduce the potential for condensation on cold surfaces (such as windows, piping, roof, or floors)."
When should you test your home for mold exposure?,"""According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), if visible mold is present on inspection, testing is usually unnecessary. There are no Environmental Protection Agency or government standards that have been established for mold or mold spore levels, so it is impossible to prove that a building or room complies with any health regulations concerning mold exposure. Likewise, the CDC does not recommend routine sampling and testing of mold in the home. Health officials haven't defined tolerable or acceptable limits of mold exposure for humans, and since individuals vary in their susceptibility to mold, testing cannot reliably predict the degree of health risks from any occurrence of mold.""'When mold has previously been identified and cleanup procedures have been undertaken, sampling and testing may be carried out if necessary by qualified professionals to determine that adequate cleaning of a building has occurred.' "
What are moles?,"'Besides being a small burrowing mammal and a unit of chemical weight, the term ''mole'' (in reference to skin) describes a variety of skin imperfections. Many prefer the term ''beauty'' mark''. The medical term for mole is ''melanocytic ''nevus''. Moles may be tan, brown, black, reddish brown, red, purple, or skin-colored and perfectly flat or raised. Most moles are smaller than a pencil eraser (about 1/2 inch).''Certain moles become darker and more apparent with sun exposure and ''pregnancy''. Moles can occur anywhere on the skin, including the ''scalp'', ears, eyelids, lips, palms, soles, genitals, and anal area.''A melanocytic ''nevus'' (plural ''nevi'') is composed of masses of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells of the skin. However, there are a variety of other skin lesions that are also mole-like. These include seborrheic keratoses, ''skin tags'', dermatofibromas, ''lentigines'', and ''freckles''. In this article, the term ''moles'' will be synonymous with melanocytic nevus.' "
"What causes moles, and what are risk factors for developing moles?","'The genes we inherit from our parents, along with our amount of sun exposure (especially during childhood) are major factors in determining mole numbers. Skin with more sun exposure tends to have more moles. However, moles may also occur in sun-protected areas.''Moles and ''freckles'' (medically termed ''ephelides'') are darker than the surrounding skin. Moles may be raised or completely flat while ''freckles'' are always flat. Freckles and ""sun spots"" (medically termed ''lentigines'') are due to an increase in the amount of dark pigment called ''melanin''. Moles are more common in people prone to freckles. Freckles are flat spots that are tan, slightly reddish, or light-brown and typically appear during the sunny months. They frequently appear on people with light complexions. Many people with blond or red hair and green or blue eyes are more prone to these types of skin spots. Sun avoidance and ''sun protection'', including the regular use of ''sunscreen'' may help to suppress the appearance of some types of moles and freckles.''Moles occur in all races (Caucasian, Asian, African, and Indian) and skin colors. Even animals have moles.''Yes. Moles may be present at birth or gradually appear later in the ''newborn'' period. Many children continue to develop moles through the teenage years and into young adulthood. Moles tend to grow very slightly in proportion to normal body growth. Congenital moles are those present at birth and so must have been present during ''fetal development''. Other moles may arise later due to factors that are not genetic but environmental, such as sun exposure.''Yes. While many moles arise in the first years of life, the total number of moles typically peaks in the second or third decade of life to an average of 35. Most people do not develop new regular moles after the age of 30. Adults often develop non-mole growths like freckles, ''lentigines'', ""''liver spots'',"" and seborrheic keratoses in later adulthood.''New moles appearing after age 35 may require close observation, medical evaluation, and possible biopsy. A brand-new mole in an adult may be a sign of an evolving abnormal mole or early ''melanoma''. It is important to have any new or changing mole evaluated by a dermatologist.''There are many mole simulators, including freckles, ''lentigines'', ''liver'' spots, seborrheic keratoses, melanomas, neurofibromas, hemangiomas, ''skin tags'', café au lait macules, and pigmented basal cell ''cancers''. The optimal way to distinguish between these other growths is by consultation with a dermatologist, which may include a ''skin biopsy''. Sometimes, a mole may occur adjacent to or on top of a non-mole growth like a ''freckle'' or ''seborrheic keratosis''. When in doubt, a ''skin biopsy'' can be very helpful in diagnosis.'  "
What three basic types of moles are there?,"'There are three basic types or groups of moles: regular and symmetrical, irregular, and cancerous. Atypical mole is another term for an irregular mole. Regular moles are typically benign and harmless. Regular moles are usually symmetrical, have regular borders, uniform color, and are about the size of a pencil eraser or smaller. Regular moles may be flat or raised. The presence of hair growing from a mole is unrelated to its ''cancer'' potential.''Irregular or ''atypical moles'"" are usually asymmetrical, with irregular borders, multiple colors, and tend to be bigger than the size of a pencil eraser. Irregular moles are often flat or nearly flat. Having more than 20-25 irregular moles may increase the person's overall risk of developing ""'melanoma''. The presence of a giant congenital mole greater than approximately 8-10 inches in size also may confer an increased risk of ''melanoma''. Irregular moles signal the potential for developing melanomas over time. Irregular moles themselves rarely turn into melanoma or ''cancer''.''Cancerous moles called melanomas, are highly irregular and are often asymmetrical. Rarely, regular moles may evolve into a melanoma over time. It is important to watch all moles closely for change or atypical features. In those with greater than 50 moles or several abnormal moles, monthly skin self-examinations and at least annual full-body moles exam by a dermatologist are important in the early detection of abnormal moles and melanoma.''Irregular moles can occur anywhere on the body but are most commonly located on sun-exposed skin, especially on the upper back and shoulders where people frequently get their most severe sunburns. The risk of melanoma is greater on chronically sun-exposed skin like the shoulders, upper back, head, and neck. Ears are a particularly common site of ''atypical moles'' because of the difficulty in applying ''sunscreen'"" and frequent sun exposure. Women have increased risks of atypical moles, particularly on the lower leg and calf. Any new or changing irregular mole on a woman's calf warrants immediate medical evaluation.""   A -- Asymmetrical B -- Irregular borders C -- Multiple colors D -- Diameter bigger than a pencil eraser E -- Evolving, changing, or new"
What are liver spots or age spots?,"'Liver spots'' or ''age spots'' (lentigines) are the common names of the flat, brown, round spots seen in adults frequently on the back of the hands, shoulders, and face. ''Liver'' spots are not true moles or freckles. The term ''liver spot'' is actually a misnomer since liver problems and ''liver disease'' do not cause these spots. While these do tend to appear over time, they are not in themselves a sign of old age. Instead, they appear on sun-exposed areas. They are commonly seen on the skin of older adults with a history of sun exposure. Liver spots are simply the result of a localized increase in the number of melanosomes (normal pigment-carrying particles in cells).' "
What are seborrheic keratoses?,"'Seborrheic keratoses (SK) contain ''melanin'' but do not contain increased numbers of melanocytes, so they are not melanocytic ''nevi''. Seborrheic keratoses are caused by a benign growth of epidermal cells. Some people call these growths ""barnacles"" or ""Rice Krispies."" Although they are most often medium brown, they can differ in color, ranging anywhere from light tan to black. They occur in different sizes. Typically, these growths are around the size of a pencil eraser or slightly larger. Some keratoses begin as flat marks and gradually raise and thicken to form a seborrheic ''keratosis''. It may be necessary to perform a biopsy to distinguish a ''seborrheic keratosis'' from an irregular mole or melanoma.''The telltale feature of a seborrheic ''keratosis'"" is its waxy, stuck-on, greasy look. It's almost possible to peel or scrape off a seborrheic keratosis while this is never true for melanocytic nevi. Seborrheic keratoses look like they either have been pasted on the skin or may look like a dab of melted brown candle wax that dropped on the skin. Seborrheic keratoses may occur in the same areas as moles. Seborrheic keratoses are also more common in areas of sun exposure but may also occur in sun-protected areas like the underwear area. When they first appear, the growths usually begin one at a time as small rough ""'bumps''. Eventually, they may thicken and develop a rough, warty surface. Seborrheic keratoses are quite common, especially after age 40. Almost everybody may eventually develop at least a few seborrheic keratoses during their lifetime. People sometimes call these growths the ""barnacles of old age.""'  "
Who is more prone to getting moles?,'Inadequately pigmented people who live in sunny climates who do not practice sun avoidance are likely to have more ''pigmented nevi''. A mole is essentially nothing more than a mass of nested melanocytes at one spot in the skin.' 
Does having more moles increase one's chance of getting melanoma?,"""Yes. The total number of irregular moles on one's body is one of the strongest indicators for the risk of developing a ""'malignant melanoma''. There is also a direct relationship between the number of innocent moles on the skin and the chance of developing an abnormal or changing mole. The more moles a person has, the greater the risk of developing atypical moles and potentially melanoma.' "
Do moles ever disappear spontaneously?,"'Yes. In some cases, moles may lighten or completely disappear later in life. In some instances, this is the result of the body\'s immune system attacking the mole and causing it to regress. One example of this is a ""''halo nevus''."" The presence of this phenomenon does not necessarily signal the presence of ''cancer''. A doctor should evaluate the nevus on its own merits, exclusive of the presence of the halo.''New or enlarging moles may be worrisome, and a dermatologist should evaluate these promptly. While moles may increase in size, particularly before the age of 20, regular moles are unlikely to enlarge as people get older. A mole that has increased in size is not necessarily cancerous. Enlargement alone does not necessarily mean a mole is ''malignant''. Some regular moles may increase in size and darken in ''pregnancy''. Often, a simple mole biopsy by a doctor can help determine if a mole is irregular.''Regular moles pose essentially little to no health risk. It is not necessary to remove all moles. The vast majority of moles are not cancerous and generally do not become cancerous. However, it may be necessary for a pathologist to remove and examine any moles that are changing, growing, new, symptomatic, or bleeding. Periodic monitoring and medical evaluation of moles is important to help determine which moles need to be removed.' "
Which skin cancers look like moles?,"'This very dangerous form of ''skin cancer'' may appear even in young people and on parts of the body that are sun exposed as well as those that are protected. While the exact cause of melanoma is unknown, genetics and ultraviolet rays are known to play a part. Melanomas may arise from a previously normal mole or pigmented spot that has been present many years. Melanomas may also arise from completely normal skin without an apparent preexisting mole. In comparison with benign (noncancerous) moles, melanomas tend to be larger, darker, and have more irregular color and shape variations. Most melanomas are actually not raised, as many people tend to incorrectly assume.''This is an uncommon fairly superficial ''skin cancer'' that generally occurs on the faces of older adults who have a history of considerable sun exposure. Over the course of months to years, this condition may, if untreated, develop into a more aggressive ''malignant'' variety called ''lentigo maligna melanoma''. There are hundreds of ordinary facial moles for every one that is potentially malignant. A simple in-office test called a skin biopsy can help diagnose ''lentigo'' maligna.''This is the most common type of ''skin cancer''. These are usually pearly, pink, or reddish in color and may bleed easily. Pigmented ''basal cell carcinoma'' is a type of basal cell ''cancer'' that may be confused with melanoma, a benign mole or a seborrheic keratosis because of its brown or dark color. A simple skin biopsy procedure can help diagnose this growth.''Patients with unusual moles or pigmented spots should have a dermatologist evaluation. Even verbal descriptions and photographs cannot convey enough information for satisfactory self-diagnosis. Routine annual mole checks are an important part of general health screenings in those at risk for ''skin cancer''. Birthdays are a good time to remember to schedule an annual ""birthday suit"" mole check. Since existing moles may change and new growth arise, periodic rechecks are necessary.''The American Academy of Dermatology recommends monthly skin self-exams and a full-body skin examination for adults as part of a routine annual health exam. It is important to have any new, changing, bleeding mole or growth examined by a dermatologist as soon as possible. If diagnosed and treated at an early stage, ''skin cancers'' (including melanomas) generally are curable.'  "
Is it possible to prevent moles?,"'Since we cannot change our own genetics, it is not possible to prevent all moles. The following ''prevention'' measures focus on sun avoidance and ''sun protection'' and include''Ideally, mole prevention is more effective than later trying to remove moles that have already developed. Mole removal will leave some type of ''scar'' at the site of the prior mole. Smaller moles are easier to remove and leave smaller ''scars''. Larger mole removal often produce larger more unsightly ''scars''.''Everyone, especially those with predisposed to freckling, should start sun protection early in childhood. Much of the sun and UV skin damage occurs often while children under age 18. Fair-skinned people who are more prone to freckling and sunburns are also generally more at risk for developing moles and ''skin cancers''. Sun sensitivity and easy burning may be a warning sign of sensitive skin, which is highly vulnerable to ''sunburn'' and to potential ''skin cancer''.' using sunscreens with SPF (sun protection factor) 50; using wide-brimmed hats (6 inches); using sun-protective clothing (shirts, long sleeves, long pants); avoiding peak sun hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; seeking shade and staying indoors."
What are treatment options for moles? What are different types of mole removal?,"'Surgical removal treats true moles. Fading or lightening creams, bleaches, freezing, or other chemicals do not treat moles. Fairly minor in-office procedures (involving the surgical excision of the entire lesion) can easily remove moles.''Regular moles do not necessarily need to be treated. A health care professional should surgically remove changing or medically suspicious moles in their entirety and sent to a lab for special tissue examination called pathology.''Some people like their moles. The cosmetic improvement of the skin is a frequent request among people with moles. Some people may like their moles if they feel they confer uniqueness (like Cindy Crawford). Other moles produce potential negative social perceptions.''Although some countries and medical centers use lasers to remove some types of moles, laser treatments are not recommended for moles. Irregular moles need to be surgically removed and the tissue sent for testing. While sun spots or lentigines may respond to bleaching or fading creams, freezing with liquid nitrogen, laser, intense pulsed light, and chemical peels, true melanocytic nevi should not be treated by these methods.''No. ''Mohs surgery'' is not designed for mole removal but rather skin ''cancer'' removal. Standard or traditional surgery removes moles. The rapid freezing technique used for ''Mohs surgery'' tends to distort mole cells and may make the removed tissue more difficult to examine under the microscope.''When the skin is cut, there will be some type of scaring produced by the healing process. Some people heal better than others. Some scars are more noticeable depending on their location and skin type.''There are many options for treatment of surgical scars, including lasers, ''scar'' creams and gels, cortisone injections, and many other choices depending on the scar. Discuss ways to help minimize scarring with a doctor.''Yes. ''Plastic'' surgeons may have additional and specialized training in cosmetic skin-growth removal. Regardless of what type of doctor removes a mole, it is important to keep in mind that all mole removals will leave some type of scar.''Most people report no or minimal discomfort after mole-removal surgery and require no ''pain'' medication. If there is ''pain'', many people find that they prefer to take something for ''pain'' at the first hint of discomfort instead of waiting until the ''pain'' builds up to an unbearable level. If someone has mild or moderate pain, a doctor may advise taking ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or another ''pain reliever'' over the counter. ''Aspirin'' or ''aspirin''-containing pain relievers may cause increased bleeding. Rarely, prescription pain medications may be required for severe pain.''Yes, there is a small chance that a mole can recur after mole surgery.''It is important to understand that no surgery has a 100% cure rate. A few mole cells may remain in the skin and may recur in the same or adjacent area. Some moles are more aggressive than others and need additional treatment and closer follow-up.'""Good follow-up appointments with a physician are very important, especially in the first few years after irregular mole removal. Many people see their physician every six to 12 months after their diagnosis of atypical moles. Patients with more aggressive moles or moles in high-risk areas may need more regular follow-up appointments. A physician will recommend the proper follow-up for someone's specific condition.""""Yes. There are no specific sun restrictions after mole removal surgery. People may go out in the sun with sunscreen and protective hats and clothing. Overall, the sun is no one's friend, and people should avoid excess sun exposure. Excess sun exposure can cause melanoma. Use of sunscreen or other cover-up on the scar is very helpful for at least six months after surgery to help minimize scarring. It is important to follow the physician's instructions for ""'wound care'' and sun protection.' "
Is there a blood test or X-ray to diagnose moles?,"'No, there are no blood tests or special ''X-rays'' for moles. There are, however, newer digital mole imaging technologies like the SIA scan (SIA = spectrophotometric intracutaneous analysis) or MelaFind that are now available to evaluate moles. These noninvasive, computerized mole-scan devices can help objectively examine a mole and capture information like size, amount, and pattern of pigment, blood flow, and other characteristics. Based on this information, changes in moles or irregular cells may be more readily identified. This technology is new and still developing.''UV cameras using special black and white images depicting the amount of sun damage may be helpful in some situations to demonstrate sun damage. UV cameras do not diagnose moles or skin ''cancer''.' "
What is molluscum contagiosum?,"'Molluscum contagiosum is a mild skin disease (''skin infection'') caused by a virus (molluscum contagiosum virus, a member of the ''Poxviridae'' family) that causes usually painless small ''bumps'' or lumps (flesh-colored or skin-colored, dome-shaped ''papules''); some may be umbilicated, meaning the lesion has a central ''depression'' with a spot in the middle that resembles a navel on the skin (umbilication). The disease occurs worldwide but is more prevalent in warm, humid climates. The disease is usually not serious and, in most people, resolves in about 6 to 12 months without treatment. It is a common infection in children; direct person-to-person contact, sexual contact, and contaminated items like clothing, towels, or other objects may transmit the infection. Some consider it to be a ''sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD''), but many others simply consider it to be a skin disease that is ''contagious'' by any skin-to-skin and indirect incidental contact with the infecting virus in adults, the elderly, and children.''The virus can infect all other parts of the body, including the face, by autoinoculation (self-transfer of the virus to another area of the skin).' "
Is molluscum contagiosum contagious?,"'With part of its name being ''contagiosum'"", you can be sure it is contagious. The virus spreads by direct skin-to-skin contact and by indirect contact (for example, towels or personal items (fomites) used in contact sports that an infected person touches, allowing the virus to pass from the towel or other item to another person's skin)."" "
What is the incubation period for molluscum contagiosum?,'The average time from exposure to the development of symptoms (incubation period) is about 2 to 7 weeks and may be as long as 6 months in some individuals.' 
"How long does the infection with molluscum contagiosum last? When does a 
person become noncontagious?","'The skin lesions last about 6 to 12 months although some individuals have had lesions last up to 4 years. Once the lesions spontaneously resolve, the person is not contagious. The contagious period is quite variable and depends on when the lesions resolve.' "
What causes molluscum contagiosum?,"'The cause is a virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, a member of the poxvirus family. The virus only survives in the skin, and when the lesions are gone, the person no longer is contagious.' "
What are risk factors for molluscum contagiosum?,"""The highest risk factor is when an uninfected person touches a skin lesion on an infected person's skin or contacts an item such as a towel that an infected person recently used. People with weakened immune systems are at risk for getting the infection and having it rapidly spread with larger lesions. Other people at high risk are wrestlers, swimmers, gymnasts, and people who use steam baths and saunas. It's also possible to transmit the infection sexually (genital infection). It is theoretically possible to contract the virus from a toilet seat, though no one has documented this."" "
What are molluscum contagiosum symptoms and signs and stages?,"'The first signs and symptoms of molluscum contagiosum are small painless papules (raised bumps or lumps) on the skin (molluscum lesions). It often appears as a raised, pearly pinkish or pearl-like nodule or redness on the skin; some nodules contain a dimple in the center. Most molluscum lesions are small, about 2-5 mm in diameter. Inside the nodule, sometimes there is a cheesy whitish core. The lesions may become ''itchy'' if scratched. The lesions may develop redness or become red and inflamed. The lesions can appear anywhere on the body (face, mouth, inner thighs, genital area, penis, or vagina, for example). The skin lesions may go through three stages; the first is a small whitish and/or reddish bump on the skin. Over a few weeks, the bumps can enlarge to about 2-5 mm with a whitish pus head that develops into a small crater when it bursts. (Stage two: Doctors advise patients not to attempt ""popping"" these pus-containing bumps or ''pimples''.) Stage three is when the burst craters develop into reddish sores; other organisms (secondary infections) may infect these open sores.'  "
How do physicians diagnose molluscum contagiosum?,"""Doctors or other health care providers diagnose molluscum contagiosum based on the person's history and physical exam. A ""'skin biopsy'' or tissue scraping that shows the viral infection is a definitive diagnosis usually made by a pathologist or a board-certified dermatologist. This definitive diagnosis is sometimes helpful to distinguish molluscum contagiosum from many other ''skin conditions'' like ''herpes'', ''genital warts'' (''HPV''), ''hives'', ''atopic dermatitis'', ''skin cancer'', ''bacterial infections'', or ''folliculitis''.' "
What is the treatment for molluscum contagiosum?,"'Most people need no treatment because the lesions spontaneously disappear (termed a self-limited disease) in about 6 to 12 months, although for a few, it may take up to 4 years. There are many treatment options. Discuss any treatment method with a doctor. Cryotherapy (freezing with liquid nitrogen), curettage (cutting out the lesions), and laser therapy may remove lesions. In addition, creams that include podophyllotoxin cream, salicylic acid, ''tretinoin'' (''Retin A'', ''Atralin'', ''Renova'', Avita, Altinac), and cantharidin may remove lesions. An antiviral medication (''Valtrex'') has been used treat the disease. Physicians may use ''cimetidine'' (''Tagamet'') to treat molluscum contagiosum in small children. A new medication, imiquimod (''Aldara'""), helps to strengthen the skin's immune response and may help to get rid of the lesions in some people. Topical desonide cream (a low-dose ""'corticosteroid'') reduces any symptoms that may accompany scratching the nodules. Some physicians may treat the disease with topical anti-inflammatory medications like ''diclofenac'' gel. Research is ongoing. Novan Inc., has B-SIMPLE4 in a pivotal phase 3 study of SB206, a topical antiviral gel. YCANTH and VP-102 are two other potential treatments for this disease.'  "
What type of doctors treat molluscum contagiosum?,"'Although primary care providers and pediatricians can treat this disease, consultants like board-certified dermatologists, infectious disease specialists, and pathologists may provide consultations for diagnosis and treatment.' "
Are there any home remedies for molluscum contagiosum?,"'There is a wide range of home remedies available for this disease. People have tried remedies such as apple cider vinegar, ''tea tree oil'', ''alcohol'', ''iodine'', hydrogen peroxide, elderberry extract, and duct tape occlusion. Unfortunately, there is little data to support these remedies although some claim to cure the disease. Some are easily available at pharmacies (for example, ZymaDerm). It is important to discuss the situation with your doctor before trying a home remedy.' "
What is the prognosis of molluscum contagiosum?,"'Most people who get molluscum contagiosum have an excellent prognosis because the infection is usually self-limiting; it typically affects only the skin and resolves without treatment over about 6 to 12 months in most people. However, immunosuppressed people have a more guarded prognosis as the disease may persist for years and become widespread on the skin; some people may get secondary bacterial skin infections; the major complication of the disease. Some treatments listed above (cryotherapy, curettage, laser, and some chemical treatments) may leave small ''scars''. Even if you get the disease and are cured, you can be reinfected and get the disease again.' "
Is it possible to prevent molluscum contagiosum?,"'It is possible to reduce the chance of getting the disease by avoiding any direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected person. Direct contact with items touched recently by an infected person (clothing, towels, and benches used in contact sports like football, for example) should also be avoided. Either not having sexual contact (genital or oral) or using ''condoms'' can prevent some individuals from getting the disease, but if the ''condom'"" does not cover an infected area, it's still possible to infect a sex partner. Washing clothes, cleaning surfaces, and limiting skin-to-skin contact may reduce the chances of becoming infected."" "
What is oral thrush?,"'Thrush'' is a ''yeast infection'' of the mouth and throat. ''Thrush'' can also be associated with yeast infections of the ''esophagus''. Thrush appears as creamy white curd-like patches on the tongue and inside of the mouth and back of the throat. As mentioned above, in individuals with impaired immune systems, yeast infections are more common. For example, in a non-infant population, thrush may be a sign of an underlying ''HIV'' infection. The child may not have any symptoms from the condition or may refuse to eat or swallow because of ''pain'' or an unusual feeling in the mouth. Sometimes older children complain of a cottony feeling in the mouth.''Another form of oral ''yeast infection'' is ''angular cheilitis'', which is the development of painful fissures at the corners of the mouth. Yeast infection can also involve the tongue and lead to flattening (erosion) of the papillae of the surface of the tongue, along with ''pain'' and reddening of the tongue (acute atrophic ''candidiasis'').' "
What are yeast infections?,"'What are commonly known as ""yeast"" infections are caused by various species of a yeast-like fungus called ''Candida'', particularly the species ''Candida albicans''. Yeast organisms are some of the germs (including bacteria) that normally reside on various parts of the body and that ordinarily cause no symptoms or signs.' "
Why do yeast sometimes cause symptoms and signs?,"'Certain conditions, such as antibiotic use, may upset the balance of microbes in the body (particularly between the bacteria and fungi) and allow an overgrowth of ''Candida''. Yeast also can thrive in chronically moist folds of skin, such as in the groin.''Yeast infections may flare up and then heal in most people. However, in newborns or individuals with impaired immune systems, yeast can cause more serious or chronic infections.'  "
How do babies get yeast infections?,"'Many infants acquire ''Candida'"" infections from their mothers during the process of birth. Yeast exists naturally in the mother's vagina. The baby comes in direct contact with the yeast during delivery through the birth canal.""'Many ''babies'' who escape this infection at birth soon acquire ''Candida'' from close contact with other family members.' "
What are oral thrush symptoms and signs?,"'Most common ''oral thrush'' symptoms include:' Thrush is characterized by a white coating or white patches on the tongue, mouth, inner cheeks, and the back of the throat.  The tissue under the white patches is often red, raw, and sore. Lesions can be painful and even bleed when scraped.  Oral thrush often looks like cottage cheese or milk curds. Bad breath Cheilosis (Cracking at the outer edges of the lips) Feeling of food stuck in the throat or sore throat Strange or unpleasant taste in the mouth Burning mouth syndrome: Symptoms of a painful burning sensation, mouth dryness, soreness, tingling, or numbness throughout the mouth and tongue. Symptoms can be associated with an abnormal bitter or metallic taste in the mouth. In severe cases of thrush, the esophagus (food pipe), which leads down to the stomach, may also be involved. This will cause pain with swallowing, fever, shaking or chills, or difficulty swallowing."
How do children (and adults) acquire thrush?,"'Outbreaks of thrush in childcare settings may be the result of an increased use of antibiotics and growth of the yeast normally present in the mouth, rather than newly acquired ''Candida'' infections. In children (and adults) taking antibiotics or steroids (such as cortisone-related ''asthma medications''), the balance of the normal microbes in the mouth can be disturbed. This may cause an overgrowth of ''Candida'', which in turn results in oral thrush.'  "
How does yeast affect diaper rash?,"'Candida'"" may infect an infant's ""'diaper'' area and worsen a ''diaper rash''. This is because yeast can grow very readily on irritated, moist skin. The infected skin is usually fiery red with areas that may have a raised red border and is usually intensely ''itchy'' (pruritic).' "
Can thumb sucking cause problems with yeast?,'Children who suck their thumbs or other fingers may occasionally develop ''Candida'' around their fingernails. This causes redness at the edges of the nails.' 
Can a nursing mother acquire yeast infections from her infant?,'Nursing'' mothers are at risk for developing ''Candida'' infections on their breasts (this is called ''mastitis'') and can be treated with the same medication that is used for infants.' 
What is the treatment for thrush and other yeast infections?,"'Health care professionals usually treat oral thrush and yeast infections, such as ''Candida'' ''diaper rash'', with antifungal medicines; these include ''nystatin'' (''Mycostatin''), ''clotrimazole'' (Lotrimin), or ''miconazole'' (''Monistat'') either by mouth or in a topical cream. Luckily, most ''Candida'' are very sensitive to nystatin, and resistance is rare. There are many topical antifungals available as ''over-the-counter'' brands. Oral thrush requires an oral medication that is available by prescription only.''The following tips can help care for children with diaper ''rash'':'   Caregivers should change the child's diapers frequently and gently cleanse the child's skin with water and a mild soap and pat it dry. It is important to minimize skin contact with urine and stool. Allowing periods of exposure to dry air without wearing a diaper can also be helpful. Barrier creams or ointments, such as Desitin or A&D, are helpful. While cornstarch may help mild diaper rash, it should not be used for children with significantly inflamed skin. High-absorbency disposable diapers may help keep the skin dry. A baby's bottom is very sensitive, so staying dry is very important. Avoid plastic pants that do not allow air to circulate over the diaper area. The diapering system should be able to hold urine or liquid feces."
What should caregivers do if the medication does not effectively treat the yeast infection?,"'There are some situations when a child may need a different medication to clear a yeast infection. A health care provider may prescribe another type of antifungal cream or oral preparation that may include ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral'', ''Extina'', ''Xolegel'', ''Kuric''), ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan''), or ''itraconazole'' (''Sporanox'').' "
Should a child with yeast infection be kept out of childcare?,"'There is no need to remove a child with yeast infection from childcare. Since most healthy people already harbor ''Candida'', children with thrush and ''Candida'' diaper rash do not have to be excluded from child care (as long they are able to participate comfortably).''Childcare providers should follow good hygiene, including careful hand washing and disposal of nasal and oral secretions of children with thrush, in order to avoid transmitting the infection to children who may not already be infected.' "
Are there other names for yeast infection?,"'Health care professionals refer to a yeast infection as candidiasis because ''Candida'' causes the infection. Thrush is another name for ''oral candidiasis''. The old name for ''Candida'' was ''Monilia''. The infection is still sometimes called ''moniliasis'', and thrush is still at times known as oral moniliasis.' "
What is esophageal pH monitoring?,'Esophageal pH (pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution) monitoring is a procedure for measuring the reflux (regurgitation or backwash) of acid from the stomach into the ''esophagus'' that occurs in ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'').' 
When is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is used to diagnose ''GERD'', to determine the effectiveness of medications that are given to prevent ''acid reflux'', and to determine if episodes of acidic reflux are causing episodes of ''chest pain''. Monitoring esophageal pH also can be used to determine if acid is reaching the pharynx (lower throat) and is possibly responsible for such symptoms as ''cough'', ''hoarseness'', and ''sore throat''.'  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring performed?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is performed by passing a thin ''plastic'' catheter a sixteenth of an inch in diameter through one nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus as the patient swallows. The tip of the catheter contains a sensor that senses acid. The sensor is positioned in the esophagus so that it is just above the lower esophageal sphincter, a specialized area of esophageal muscle that lies at the junction of the esophagus and stomach and prevents acid from refluxing back up into the esophagus. In this position the sensor records each reflux of acid. The catheter protruding from the nose is connected to a recorder that registers each reflux of acid. ''The patient is sent home with the catheter and recorder in place and returns the next day to have them removed. During the 24 hours that the catheter is in place, the patient goes about his or her usual activities, for example, eating, sleeping, and working. Meals, periods of ''sleep'', and symptoms are recorded by the patient in a diary and/or by pushing buttons on the recorder.  After the catheter is removed, the recorder is attached to a computer so that the data it has gathered can be downloaded into the computer where it is analyzed and put into graphic form. The procedure can be modified by placing the sensor in the upper esophagus or pharynx to determine if refluxed acid is reaching the pharynx.''The most recently-developed device for monitoring esophageal pH uses a capsule also known as the Bravo Capsule. The capsule contains an acid sensing probe, a battery, and a transmitter. The probe monitors the acid in the esophagus and transmits the information to a recorder that is worn by the patient on a belt. The capsule is introduced into the esophagus on a catheter through the nose or mouth and is attached to the lining of the esophagus with a clip. The catheter then is detached from the capsule and removed. Thus, there is no catheter protruding from the nose. The capsule transmits for two days or three days, and then the battery dies. Five to seven days later, the capsule falls off the esophageal lining and is passed in the ''stool'' as the capsule is not reusable. ''The advantages of the capsule device are related to the absence of a catheter connecting the probe to the recorder.  There is greater comfort without a catheter in the back of the throat, and patients are more likely to go to work and do more of their normal activities without feeling self-conscious about the appearance of the catheter to others. The disadvantages of the capsule are that it cannot be used in the pharynx (where it would be impossibly uncomfortable) and, so far, it has not been used in the stomach. '  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Almost everyone has some acidic reflux, but the amount of reflux is small and rarely causes inflammation of the esophagus (''esophagitis''). As the amount of acid reflux increases above the normal range, so does the probability of developing esophagitis and its symptoms. In patients with symptoms that suggest acid reflux, a diagnosis of reflux can be made by demonstrating an acid pH in the esophagus for a greater than normal amount of time.'""A common alternative method to diagnose reflux is to treat patients with medications that reduce reflux. If the patient's symptoms stop, then the symptoms are likely to be due to acid reflux. Another way of diagnosing acid reflux as the cause of symptoms is to demonstrate that episodes of acid reflux recorded by esophageal pH monitoring occur at exactly the same time as esophageal ""'pain''.''Esophageal pH monitoring also can be used to determine why treatment for reflux is not working. For example, a patient treated for acidic reflux may continue to have symptoms. If so, then the question must be asked as to why the symptoms are continuing. Is it because the medication is not adequate or is it because the symptoms are not due to reflux and, therefore, are not going to respond to treatment for reflux? If the pH monitoring study performed while the patient takes his or her medication for reflux shows abnormal amounts of reflux, then treatment is inadequate and needs to be changed. If the amount of acid reflux is within the normal range, then it is likely that the symptoms are not being caused by acid reflux, and other potential problems need to be considered as the cause of the symptoms.' "
What are the limitations of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'The demonstration of abnormal amounts of acid reflux does not mean that symptoms are being caused by the reflux.  Only treatment with medications that treat reflux coupled with a marked reduction of symptoms can be used to substantiate reflux as the cause of the symptoms.  Nevertheless, it is important to remember that treatment is associated with a placebo response. For instance, 10% to 20% of patients without acid reflux report an improvement in  symptoms with anti-reflux medications.  Therefore, even a good response to treatment does not definitely prove that reflux is the cause of symptoms.''Some of the strongest evidence that episodic ''chest pain'' is being caused by acid reflux is provided by demonstrating that the painful episodes coincides with an episode of acid reflux.  If there are very frequent episodes of reflux, however, it may not be possible to separate a true association between a symptom and reflux from a chance association due to the great frequency of episodes of reflux.  Conversely, if a symptom occurs infrequently, for example, once every few days, it is unlikely that the symptom will occur during a routine 24 hour monitoring session, and therefore, a correlation will not be possible.  One attempt to get around the latter problem is to extend the monitoring to several days, but this extended monitoring is done infrequently.' "
Are there other ways in which pH monitoring can be used?,"'If the pH sensor is left in the stomach instead of the esophagus, it is possible to determine the effectiveness of medications that shut off the production of acid in the stomach.  This information may be useful in determining the proper doses of medications among patients with acid-related conditions of the stomach and duodenum (for example, peptic ulcers).  It also is possible to place a catheter with two acid sensors so that one sensor is in the stomach and the other is in the lower esophagus.  With this catheter, it is possible to evaluate both acidic ''esophageal reflux'' and the effectiveness of acid-suppressing medications.''The pH sensor may be placed in the upper esophagus or in the pharynx just above the upper esophageal sphincter in patients with unexplained symptoms of ''sore throat'', ''hoarseness'', or ''cough''.  In these patients, the demonstration of acid reflux into the upper esophagus or pharynx suggests that acid reflux may be the cause of the symptoms. Recent studies however have shown that the association of these symptoms with acidic reflux may not be reliable.' "
What are the side effects of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'There are very few side effects of esophageal pH monitoring. Although there may be mild discomfort in the back of the throat while the catheter is in place, particularly during swallows, the majority of patients have no difficulty eating, sleeping, or going about their daily activities. Most patients, however, prefer not to go to work because they feel self-conscious about the catheter protruding from their nose. The capsule device may cause discomfort when swallowing. The discomfort is felt in the chest and may be due to food or the wave of esophageal contraction tugging on the capsule as it passes.' "
Are there alternatives to esophageal pH monitoring?,"'There are no alternatives for obtaining the information that esophageal pH monitoring provides.  Nevertheless, the presence of esophagitis visually at the time of ''endoscopy'"" strongly suggests the presence of acidic reflux among patients who don't have other likely causes of esophageal ""'pain''.  This may obviate the need to do a pH monitoring study.' "
What is monkeypox?,"'Monkeypox is a relatively rare disease that was first detected in monkeys in Africa in 1958 and resembles smallpox in terms of the skin lesions (pox) seen in humans as part of the physical findings and also because the cause is a virus that is closely related to the smallpox (variola) virus. Monkeypox, smallpox, cowpox, and vaccinia ''viruses'' all belong to the same family of viruses, the ''Poxviridae''. Monkeypox belongs to same genus (''Orthopoxvirus'') as smallpox. The disease is different from smallpox.' "
Is monkeypox contagious?,"'Monkeypox may be transferred from animals to people or person to person and has far less mortality (death rate) than smallpox had. The case-fatality rate (death rate) for monkeypox virus infection in Africa varies from about 1%-15% and about 15%-20% in children. Monkeypox virus is endemic in rodent populations in Africa. Smallpox did not infect any endemic animal population and only infected humans. The press and bloggers have occasionally tried to link monkeypox to other diseases such as ''mad cow disease'', ''Ebola'', ''leprosy'', ''yellow fever'', and other viral and immunological diseases, but there is no scientific evidence for this.' "
What is the history of monkeypox?,"'Monkeypox has a relatively recent history. People first discovered it in monkeys in 1958, although a ""vesicular disease in monkeys"" was described in the 1860s. The disease, and eventually the causative virus, was named monkeypox because the lesions (pox) seen in monkeys developed like other known pox-forming diseases (pustules that eventually break open, ulcerate, crust over, and some pox form ''scars'' in the skin). Later studies showed the ""monkeypox"" virus was actually sustained endemically in African rodents. It was not until 1970 in Africa (Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo also termed Republic of the Congo, DRC, and Congo), when a 9-year-old boy (who developed smallpox-like lesions) was the first person to eventually be diagnosed with monkeypox. This situation initially caused concern that smallpox may also have an animal reservoir or endemic population that would make eradication of smallpox impossible. Fortunately, this was not the case because monkeypox was found to be a different species of poxvirus, and smallpox was eradicated from the human population by ''vaccinations'' in 1979 (currently, only a few research labs have access to smallpox viruses). Monkeypox is now the major ''Orthopoxvirus'' (also termed orthopox) that infects humans and fortunately, not frequently. However, vigilance is warranted, as there have been several outbreaks of monkeypox since the 1970s. Although most have occurred in Africa (mainly western and central Africa), there was an outbreak in the U.S. in 2003. This apparently happened when an animal distributor either housed or transported monkeypox-infected African rodents (Gambian rats) with prairie ''dogs'' that people later purchased as pets, became ""sick,"" and transmitted the disease to their owners. Other animals like the rope squirrel (''Funisciurus anerythrus'') and the sun squirrel (''Heliosciurus rufobrachium'') may transmit the virus to humans in Africa.''In 2017, an outbreak of monkeypox began in Nigeria. The Minister of Health said the virus has spread to 11 states and 74 suspected individuals are affected. This large outbreak is thought to be triggered by river flooding that has caused infected wild animals (especially rodents and monkeys) to more closely associate with humans, thus spreading this zoonotic (transmitted to humans from animals) disease. In September 2018, Dr. Beadsworth in England reported treating three people with monkeypox who had visited Nigeria. Since 2017, Nigeria has had an outbreak with 89 reported infected people and six deaths; the three patients likely were exposed to the virus while visiting Nigeria.' "
What causes monkeypox? How does monkeypox spread?,"'An ''Orthopoxvirus'' named monkeypox causes monkeypox. The viruses are oval brick-shaped viruses that have a lipoprotein layer with tubules or filaments that cover the viral DNA. There are many members of this viral genus, including such species as variola (smallpox), cowpox, buffalopox, camelpox, rabbitpox, and others. Most species infect a particular animal species but occasionally may infect other mammals.''Transmission of monkeypox is usually by direct contact with infected animals or possibly by eating poorly cooked meat from an infected rodent or monkey. Cutaneous or mucosal lesions on the infected animals are a likely source of transmission to humans, especially when the human skin is broken due to bites, scratches, or other ''trauma'' -- are a likely source for virus infection. Human-to-human transfer, probably by infected respiratory droplets, is possible but is not often documented. One study suggested that only about 8%-15% of infections occurred through human-to-human transmission among close family members.' "
What are risk factors for monkeypox?,"""Monkeypox is a relatively uncommon disease. Risk factors include animal bites and scratches from infected animals (mainly African rodents or monkeys) or from other rodents (like prairie dogs) that have had contact with African animals infected with the virus. People should avoid eating any meat from such animals is advised. Recent studies have shown that monkeypox can infect several species of mammals, even though the species had never been associated with the virus in their normal environment. Reduce or prevent person-to-person transfer, although infrequent, by avoiding direct physical contact with the patient and having the patient's caregivers wear gloves and face masks."" "
What are monkeypox symptoms and signs?,"'The first symptoms that occur are ''nonspecific -- ''fever'','' ''sweating'', malaise, and some patients may develop a ''cough'', ''nausea'', and ''shortness of breath''. About two to four days after fever develops, a ''rash'' with papules and pustules develops most often on the face and chest, but other body areas may eventually be affected, including ''mucus'' membranes inside the nose and mouth. These skin and mucus membrane pox lesions can ulcerate, crust over, and then begin to heal in about 14-21 days. In addition, lymph nodes usually swell during this time. Some pox lesions may become necrotic and destroy sebaceous glands, leaving a ''depression'' or pox ''scar'' that, with monkeypox, may gradually become less pronounced over a few years. The toxemia that was seen with smallpox is not seen with monkeypox.' "
What is the incubation period for monkeypox?,"'The incubation period (time from exposure to first symptoms) is about seven to 14 days. First symptoms include fever, ''headache'', muscle pains, ''swollen lymph nodes'', and feeling tired. ''Swollen lymph nodes'' help distinguish monkeypox from smallpox.' "
How long is the contagious period for monkeypox?,"'The infected person is not contagious during the incubation period. However, human cases can be contagious as soon as symptoms develop. The person is contagious until all scabs from the pox lesions fall off. Consequently, the person is usually contagious for about four to five weeks.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose monkeypox?,"'The history (especially association with rodents or other animals) and physical exam (present of pox lesions) is presumptive evidence for a diagnosis of monkeypox. Caution is advised. Infectious disease consultants and the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) personnel should be notified because this infection may represent two additional problems. First, in the U.S. or other countries, it may likely indicate an outbreak of monkeypox, and informed health authorities may help to identify the source of the infection and prevent its spread. The second problem is unlikely but far more serious; the early symptoms may represent a biological warfare or terrorist attack with smallpox that is mistakenly identified as monkeypox. Consequently, definitive diagnosis of this viral disease, outside of Africa, and especially in developed countries where monkeypox is not endemic, is urged. Most laboratories do not have the reagents to do this testing, so state labs or the CDC will need to process the samples to establish a definitive diagnosis. These tests are based on detecting antigenic structures (usually from skin or pox samples or occasionally serum) specific to either monkeypox virus or immunoglobulin that reacts with the virus. PCR (''polymerase chain reaction''), ELISA techniques (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), or Western blotting tests (immunoblotting) are the main tests used.' "
What is the treatment for monkeypox?,"'The CDC recommends the following:''For severe symptoms, supportive measures such as mechanical ventilation may rarely be needed. Consultation with an infectious-diseases expert and the CDC is recommended.'  A smallpox vaccination should be administered within two weeks of exposure to monkeypox. Cidofovir (Vistide), an antiviral drug, is suggested for patients with severe, life-threatening symptoms. Vaccinia immune globulin may be used, but efficacy of use has not been documented."
What is the prognosis of monkeypox?,"'The usual prognosis of patients with monkeypox is good to excellent. Many patients have mild symptoms. However, patients with immune or other compromised health problems (malnutrition, lung problems) may develop complications of secondary ''bacterial infections'', ''pneumonia'', and ''dehydration''. Older estimations of a 10% death rate were published, but in the last 10-15 years, this has been revised to less than 2% of infected individuals, with the worst cases originating from animal-to-human infection, not person to person.' "
Is it possible to prevent monkeypox with a vaccine?,"'Monkeypox can be prevented by avoiding eating or touching animals known to acquire the virus in the wild (mainly African rodents and monkeys). Person-to-person transfer has been documented. Patients who have the disease should physically isolate themselves until all of the pox lesions have healed (lost their crusts), and people who are caring for these patients should use barriers (gloves and face masks) to avoid any direct or droplet contact. Caregivers should obtain a smallpox vaccination (see below).''Because smallpox and monkeypox are so closely related, studies have suggested that people vaccinated against smallpox have about an 85% chance of being protected from monkeypox. Consequently, the CDC recommends the following:''There is no commercially available vaccine designed specifically for monkeypox.' Patients with depressed immune systems and those who are allergic to latex or smallpox vaccine should not get the smallpox vaccine. Anyone else who has been exposed to monkeypox in the past 14 days should get the smallpox vaccine, including children under 1 year of age, pregnant women, and people with skin conditions."
What research is being done on monkeypox?,"'Research is ongoing with monkeypox virus. For example, prairie dogs are being used as animal models to test the effectiveness of vaccinations. Several studies are using animal models to test the effectiveness of several antiviral ''drugs'' to reduce or eliminate symptoms in experimental infections. Because of the close relationship of smallpox to monkeypox, genetic comparison and genetic alteration studies are likely to be available in the future, along with more rapid detection tests.' "
Where can people get more information about monkeypox?,"'Additional information about monkeypox can be found at these web sites:''""''Monkeypox'',"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention''""''Monkeypox'',"" Medscape.com' "
What is infectious mononucleosis?,"'Infectious mononucleosis'', ""mono,"" ""kissing disease,"" and glandular ''fever'' are all terms popularly used for the very common infection typically caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but other ''viruses'' can also cause the disease. This article focuses specifically on the Epstein-Barr virus as a cause of mono since this is the characteristic virus associated with the condition.''The symptoms of Epstein-Barr virus infection include fever, ''fatigue'', malaise, and ''sore throat''. The designation ""''mononucleosis''"" refers to an increase in a particular type of mononuclear white blood cells (lymphocytes) in the bloodstream relative to the other white blood cells as a result of the viral infection. Scientifically, EBV is classified as a member of the herpesvirus family.''The disease was first described in 1889 and was referred to as ""Drüsenfieber,"" or glandular fever. The term infectious mononucleosis was first used in 1920 when an increased number of lymphocytes were found in the blood of a group of college students who had fever and symptoms of the condition.' "
What are the symptoms of mono?,"'The initial ''symptoms of mono'' are''These initial symptoms can last from one to three days before the more intense symptoms of the illness begin. The more common intense symptoms include''It is typically the severe sore throat that prompts people to contact their doctor.'   a general lack of energy or malaise, fatigue, a loss of appetite, and chills. a severe sore throat and fever, which may be persistent."
What are the signs of mono?,"'In addition to a fever from 102 F-104 F, the most common signs of mono are''The ''tonsils'"" have a whitish coating in at least one-third of the cases. The spleen (sometimes referred to as the body's biggest ""'lymph node'') is an organ found in the left upper abdomen underneath the rib cage, which becomes enlarged or swollen in about half of patients with mono. An ''enlarged liver'' and abnormalities in ''liver function'' tests (blood tests) may be detected (see Complications, below). Some of patients have a splotchy red ''rash'' over the body, which has a similar appearance to the ''rash'' of ''measles''. Early in the course of disease (over the first few days of illness), a temporary swelling (''edema'') of both upper eyelids may appear.' a very reddened throat and tonsils (tonsillitis) and swollen lymph nodes in the neck that typically occur on both sides."
What is the cause of mono?,"""The EBV that causes mono is found throughout the world. By the time most people reach adulthood, antibodies against EBV can be detected in their blood. In the U.S., up to 95% of adults 35-40 years of age have antibodies directed against EBV. This means that most people, sometime in their lives, have been infected with EBV. The body's immune system produces antibodies to attack and help destroy invading viruses and bacteria. These specific EBV antibodies can be detected in the blood of people who have been infected with mono.""'When infection occurs in childhood, the virus most often produces no symptoms. It is estimated that only about 10% of children who become infected with EBV develop the illness. Likewise, probably because of immunity from prior infection, adults typically do not develop the illness. Most cases of infectious mononucleosis occur in the 15-24 age group.''While there are other illnesses falling under the broad classification of mononucleosis that can cause similar symptoms (''cytomegalovirus'' [''CMV''] infection is one example) and an increase in blood lymphocytes, the mononucleosis caused by the EBV is by far the most common.'  "
What are the risk factors for mono?,"'The EBV can infect anyone. As previously discussed, the majority of people have become infected with the virus by the time that they reach adulthood, and the majority of these infections produce no symptoms and are not recognized as mono. Mono is most often diagnosed in adolescents and young adults, with a peak incidence at 15-17 years of age. However, it can also be seen in children. Generally, the illness is less severe in young children and may mimic the symptoms of other common ''childhood illnesses'', which may explain why it is less commonly diagnosed or recognized in this younger age group.'  "
How is mono transmitted or spread? What is the incubation period for mono? What is the contagious period for mono?,"'Mono is spread by person-to-person contact. Saliva is the primary method of transmitting mono, which leads to the infection of B lymphocytes in the mouth and throat. Infectious mononucleosis developed its common name of ""kissing disease"" from this prevalent form of transmission among teenagers. It typically takes between four to eight weeks for people become symptomatic after the initial Epstein-Barr virus infection. A person with mono can also pass the disease by ''coughing'' or ''sneezing'', causing small droplets of infected saliva and/or ''mucus'' to be suspended in the air which can be inhaled by others. Sharing food or ''beverages'' from the same container or utensil can also transfer the virus from one person to another since contact with infected saliva may result.'""Most people have been exposed to the virus as children, and as a result of the exposure, they have developed immunity to the virus. It is of note that most people who are exposed to the EBV don't ever develop mononucleosis. The incubation period for mono, meaning the time from the initial viral infection until the appearance of clinical symptoms, is between four and eight weeks. During an infection, the contagious period in which a person is likely able to transmit the virus to others lasts for at least a few weeks and possibly longer, even after symptoms have disappeared (see below).""'Research has shown that, depending on the method used to detect the virus, anywhere from 20%-80% of people who have had mononucleosis and have recovered will continue to secrete the EBV in their saliva for years due to periodic ""reactivations"" of the viral infection. Since healthy people without symptoms also secrete the virus during reactivation episodes throughout their lifetime, isolation of people infected with EBV is not necessary. It is currently believed that these healthy people, who nevertheless secrete EBV particles, are the primary reservoir for transmission of EBV among humans. Therefore, it can be difficult to precisely determine how long the infection may be contagious.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose infectious mono?,"'The diagnosis of mono is suspected by the doctor based on the above symptoms and signs. Mono is confirmed by blood tests that may also include tests to exclude other possible causes of the symptoms, such as tests to rule out ''strep throat''. Early in the course of the mono, blood tests may show an increase in one type of white blood cell (lymphocyte). Some of these increased lymphocytes have an unusual or appearance (known as atypical lymphocytes) when viewed under a microscope, which suggests mono.'""More specific blood tests, such as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests, can confirm the diagnosis of mono. These tests rely on the body's immune system to make measurable antibodies against the EBV. Unfortunately, the antibodies may not become detectable until the second or third weeks of the illness. A blood chemistry test may reveal inflammation and abnormalities in liver function. Diagnostic tests performed in the laboratory may be of value to rule out other causes of sore throat and fever, including ""'cytomegalovirus'' infection, ''strep throat'', and less common conditions such as ''acute HIV infection'' or ''toxoplasmosis''.' "
What health care specialists treat infectious mono?,"'Infectious mono'"" is often managed by primary care specialists, including pediatricians and family-medicine specialists. Internal medicine specialists also treat patients with mono. With complications or severe situations, other medical specialists including infectious-disease specialists, hematologists, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, or neurologists, may be consulted. With certain clinical complications such as rupture of the spleen, a surgeon will be involved in the patient's care."" "
What is the usual course and treatment of mono?,"'In most cases of mono, no specific medical treatment is necessary. The illness is usually self-limited and passes much the way other common viral illnesses resolve. Treatment is directed toward the relief of clinical symptoms and signs. Available antiviral ''drugs'' have no significant effect on the overall outcome of mono and may actually prolong the course of the illness. Occasionally, ''strep throat'' occurs in conjunction with mono and is best treated with ''penicillin'' or ''erythromycin'' (E-Mycin, ''Eryc'', ''Ery-Tab'', ''PCE'', Pediazole, Ilosone). ''Ampicillin'' (Omnipen, Polycillin, Principen) and ''amoxicillin'' (''Amoxil'', DisperMox, ''Trimox'') should be avoided if there is a possibility of mono since up to 90% of patients with mono develop a rash when taking these medications. If this happens, the individuals may then be inappropriately thought to have an ''allergy'' to penicillin.''For the most part, supportive or comfort measures are all that is necessary. Antiviral medications have not been shown to be of benefit. ''Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') can be given for fever and any ''headache'' or body aches. A sufficient amount of ''sleep'' and rest is important. The throat soreness is worst during the first five to seven days of illness and then subsides over the next seven to 10 days. The swollen, tender ''lymph nodes'' generally subside by the third week.''A feeling of fatigue or ''tiredness'' may persist for months following the acute infection phase of the illness. It is recommended that patients with mono avoid participation in any contact sports for three to four weeks after the onset of symptoms to prevent ''trauma'' to the ''enlarged spleen''. The enlarged spleen is susceptible to rupture, which can be life-threatening. Cortisone medication is occasionally given for the treatment of severely ''swollen tonsils'' or throat tissues that threaten to obstruct ''breathing''.''Patients can continue to have virus particles present in their saliva for as long as 18 months after the initial infection. When symptoms persist for more than six months, the condition is frequently called ""chronic"" EBV infection or ""chronic mononucleosis."" However, laboratory tests generally cannot confirm continued active EBV infection in people with chronic EBV symptoms.'  "
What are the complications of mono?,"'A common, but usually not serious, complication of mono is a mild inflammation of the liver, or ''hepatitis''. This form of hepatitis is rarely serious or requires treatment. It generally resolves on its own as the condition improves. The enlargement of the spleen that occurs with mono makes traumatic rupture of the spleen a possible complication. Swelling of the throat and tonsils can also lead to ''airway'' obstruction when severe. Infection in the area of the tonsil can rarely become a serious ''abscess'' referred to as a peritonsillar abscess.''Fortunately, the more severe complications of mono are quite rare, and mono is very rarely fatal in healthy people. The rare severe complications include destruction of ''red blood cells'' (hemolytic ''anemia'') and inflammation of the sac surrounding the ''heart'' (''pericarditis''), the heart muscle itself (''myocarditis''), and the brain (''encephalitis''). Mono tends to be more aggressive in patients with abnormal immune systems, such as people with ''AIDS'' or those who are taking medications that suppress immune function.''The EBV has been associated with some types of ''cancers'', most commonly ''lymphomas''. This occurs most frequently in people whose immune systems have been compromised due to disease or immune-suppressive drugs. EBV infection has also been found to be associated with two types of ''cancer'' is sometimes found in other cultures -- nasopharyngeal ''carcinoma'' (''cancer'"" of the pharynx and nose) in southern China and Burkitt's ""'lymphoma'"" of the jaw among children in equatorial Africa. Further, numerous studies have also found that EBV infection is associated with the development of at least one subtype of Hodgkin's disease. However, since the vast majority of people have been infected with EBV and never develop these types of tumors, EBV infection cannot be the sole cause of these cancers. The overwhelming majority of people who have had mono recover completely without any serious complications."" "
What is the prognosis of mono?,"'Most people with mono recover completely with no long-term problems. The fatigue associated with the condition may persist for a few months after the fever and other symptoms have resolved. Severe complications as described above are very rare.''Infectious mononucleosis is usually a self-limited, although sometimes prolonged, and often uncomfortable illness. While specific treatment is rarely necessary, the potential complications make it essential that people with this illness be under the care of a physician.' "
Is it possible to prevent mono?,"'Since mono is spread from person to person, avoiding close personal contact with infected individuals and practicing excellent hygienic practices can help prevent transmission of the virus. This includes avoiding sharing contaminated utensils like toothbrushes and drinking glasses. However, since periodic reactivations of the virus infection seem to occur in healthy individuals and because many infected people who may transmit the virus to others will not have symptoms of the condition, ''prevention'' is extremely difficult. In fact, these individuals without symptoms are believed to be the primary source of transmission of the virus. The fact that up to 95% of adults have antibodies to EBV suggests that prevention of the infection is difficult if not impossible. It is not known why some people develop the symptoms of mono while others appear to acquire the EBV infection without having symptoms. It is possible that many infections occur and produce mild symptoms and are not recognized as mono, while other infections may not produce symptoms at all.' "
What is mono (mononucleosis)?,"'Mono'' (also termed ''mononucleosis'' or ''infectious mononucleosis'') is a disease caused by the ''Epstein-Barr virus'' (EBV). Children are commonly infected with EBV and show few or no symptoms. Older individuals, teenagers, and adults may show symptoms when infected. These consist mainly of ''fatigue'', ''fever'', inflamed throat, and ''swollen lymph nodes'' in the neck. Infected people may also have a ''rash'', swollen ''liver'', or ''enlarged spleen''. Most of the symptoms get better within two to four weeks, but some people can be fatigued for several months. The EBV virus can become inactive after infection, and some people reactivate EBV infection even years later.' "
Is mono contagious?,"'Mono is ''contagious'"" from person to person, especially via an infected person's saliva. Other transmission methods include blood, semen, blood transfusions, and organ transplants. Unfortunately, EBV can also be spread by contact with objects like toothbrushes or eating utensils that are contaminated with EBV. Mono can be spread to ""'babies'', children, and adults. Individuals who have mono can be contagious without the characteristic symptoms of ''fever'', ''fatigue'', or swollen glands; some people can be contagious during the incubation period when no symptoms are present.' "
How do I know if I have mono?,"'Symptoms of EBV infection may include some or most of the following symptoms:'""Many diseases produce similar symptoms, so the diagnosis is usually based on the patient's history, physical, and EBV antibody tests (for example, IgG, IgM, and VCA antibody tests, Monospot test, and others). Interpretation of these tests is not always definitive."" Fatigue Inflamed throat Fever Swollen lymph nodes in the neck Enlarged spleen and/or liver Rash"
How is mono transmitted? What is the incubation period for mono?,"'Mono (mononucleosis) is spread from person to person. It is usually not spread by airborne droplets (it can be in some instances when saliva is sprayed and then inhaled) but by direct contact with an infected person\'s saliva. Because of the predominant way mono is spread (saliva), it has been termed the ""kissing disease."" The incubation period (from time of exposure to EBV to symptom development) is about four to seven weeks, and some people can spread the disease during the incubation period and up to 18 months later. Mono can be spread by blood, semen, and organ transplants. Saliva-contaminated toothbrushes, utensils, and contact with other EBV-contaminated objects may also spread the disease.' "
When will I know I am cured of mono?,"'Unfortunately, the term ""cured"" doesn\'t relate well to mono (mononucleosis) because, once infected, a person seems to be infected with EBV for life as occasional ""reactivation"" of the virus does occur even in healthy people who show no symptoms. Most people will never notice the reactivation of EBV, but according to researchers, these reactivated ''viruses'"" are probably responsible for the occasional outbreaks in individuals who have not been infected with EBV. It's estimated that about 20%-80% of people infected with mononucleosis shed EBV occasionally for many years."" "
When should I contact a health care professional about mono?,"'The majority of individuals who get mono do not require treatment by a physician. However, if you have been diagnosed with mono and had treatment at home for seven to 10 days and you still have problems with poor energy levels, body ''aches'', and swollen ''lymph nodes'', you should contact a physician. If you have a severe ''sore throat'' that lasts longer than two to three days, you should also contact a physician. You should go to an emergency department if your ''tonsils'' become swollen and they interfere with swallowing and/or ''breathing'', or if you have severe ''pain'' in the upper abdomen in the left side (possible spleen rupture).' "
What causes mononucleosis?,"'Mononucleosis'' is a ''contagious'' (but not highly contagious) disease, mostly caused by ''Epstein-Barr virus'' (''EBV'') infection. Hence, it is also known as ''infectious mononucleosis''.''EBV is a ''herpes'' virus, and it is found all over the world. Most people get infected with EBV at some point in their lives.\xa0''EBV enters into your body commonly through saliva. The body reacts by developing antibodies against the virus. This immune response results in the development of ''fever''.''Besides EBV, other causes of mononucleosis include:' Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Adenovirus Hepatitis A Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Toxoplasma Rubella"
How does mononucleosis spread?,"'Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is transmitted via intimate contact with body secretions, primarily saliva. The organism may also be shed from the uterine cervix and can be transmitted sexually, although it is more likely to be spread through saliva. On rare occasions, EBV spreads via ''blood transfusion'' or organ transplantation.''EBV can be spread through objects used by an infected person. These objects may be a glass or ''toothbrush'' that transmits the virus through the saliva from an infected person to a healthy person. The virus probably survives on an object that remains moist for a longer time.\xa0''If you have been infected with EBV, you can spread the virus even before you develop its symptoms. You can continue to transmit the virus for as long as six months after mononucleosis has set in.' "
How common is mononucleosis?,"'It is estimated that up to 95% of adults in the world eventually test positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, it is most commonly seen to affect 15- to 24-year olds. Hence, ''infectious mononucleosis'' is also referred to as “kissing disease.” Because most of the adults have been previously exposed to mononucleosis in their younger years, it is uncommon in adults.''In the United States, approximately 50% of the population tests positive for EBV before age 5 years, with much of the rest testing positive in adolescence.''Infectious mononucleosis'' develops in at least one out of four teenagers and young adults who get infected with EBV.' "
Can mononucleosis recur?,"'Most people who developed infectious mononucleosis will get it only once in their lifetime. Very rarely, mononucleosis recurs months or years later.''Most of the cases of mononucleosis are due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The characteristic of EBV infection is that once you get infected with it, it continues to stay in your body in an inactive state. At times, it may reactivate and your saliva may test positive for EBV, but you do not develop any symptoms of mononucleosis. Only when your immunity is weakened due to ''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''AIDS''), there are high chances of the redevelopment of EBV mononucleosis.' "
What is Morgellons disease?,"'Morgellons disease is a delusional disorder that leads to the belief that one has parasites or foreign material moving in, or coming out of, the skin. Morgellons disease is a little-known disorder that is often associated with nonspecific skin, nerve, and psychiatric symptoms. Some refer to it as a ''fiber'' disease. People with this disorder seem to be more likely to develop low ''thyroid'' functioning (''hypothyroidism''). Caucasian females from about 35 to 50 years old tend to develop this uncommon condition more than other groups, and Texas and California seem to have a higher incidence of this condition than other U.S. states.'  "
What causes Morgellons disease? Is Morgellons disease contagious?,'There are reports of Morgellons disease in patients with ''Lyme disease''. Many health care professionals believe that Morgellons disease is a form of psychosis that causes the person to imagine that they are infested by parasites (delusional parasitosis) rather than a diagnosis based upon physical signs. Research on this syndrome has so far not found it to be caused by an infection. It is therefore not ''contagious''. This condition has not been found to be the result of an environmental toxin.' 
What are Morgellons disease symptoms and signs?,"'People with Morgellons disease often complain of'' They also often report that they have what look like threads, hair, or fuzz coming out of lesions on their skin. Some practitioners have observed the fibers coming out of the skin of Morgellons disease sufferers, leaving what pictures indicate are disfiguring lesions behind. For these reasons, Morgellons disease is sometimes referred to as skin crawling disease. The individual with this problem may feel that they have skin mites, springtails (collembola), or ''scabies'' that cause the skin sensation. Other symptoms that are sometimes associated with this condition include'   skin itching, burning, feeling like there is something crawling under their skin. depression, chronic fatigue, tobacco use, difficulty thinking clearly."
How do health care professionals diagnose Morgellons disease?,"'There is no established standard for the diagnosis of Morgellons disease. As with people suffering from most medical complaints, health care professionals tend to assess individuals for this condition by gathering historical information about symptoms, as well as asking questions about medical and ''mental health'' symptoms. They perform a physical examination and may order a variety of lab tests to determine the appropriate diagnosis. To assess the specific skin complaints associated with Morgellons disease, the medical professional might request a ''skin biopsy''.' "
What are treatment options for Morgellons disease?,"'While there is no specific cure for Morgellons disease, individuals who suffer from this condition have been found to benefit from medications that treat psychosis or ''tics'', like ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa'', ''Zydis'', Relprevv) or ''pimozide'' (''Orap''), respectively.'  "
What is the prognosis for Morgellons disease?,"' Unfortunately, the prognosis for this disorder is difficult because of the lack of clarity regarding its symptoms, diagnosis, and potential causes.''Editor\'s addendum: According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (Pearson, et al., 2012, reference below), ""This condition is not currently recognized as a distinct clinical disorder with established diagnostic criteria that are generally accepted by the medical community and many dermatologists consider the condition to be synonymous with delusional parasitosis (DP). To date, most of what is known about the condition is based on isolated case reports or anecdotal accounts. A range of potential infectious (for example, ''Lyme disease'', parasitic) and non-infectious causes has been postulated, but the etiology of this condition remains unknown and there have been no proven effective medical therapies.""' "
Introduction to birth control,"'If a woman is sexually active and she is ''fertile'' and physically able to become ''pregnant'', she needs to ask herself, ""Do I want to become pregnant now?"" If her answer is ""No,"" she must use some method of ''birth control'' (''contraception'').''Terminology used to describe ''birth control methods'' includes:''Regardless of the terminology used, sexually active people can choose from a variety of methods to reduce the possibility of their ''becoming pregnant''. No method of ''birth control'' available today offers perfect protection against sexually transmitted diseases or ''STDs'', except abstinence.'""In simple terms, all methods of birth control are based on either preventing a man's sperm from reaching and entering a woman's egg (""'fertilization'"") or preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the woman's uterus (her womb) and starting to grow. New methods of birth control are being developed and tested all the time. What is appropriate for a couple at one point may change with time and circumstances.""'Unfortunately, no birth control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.''Emergency contraception'' is a medication or device that is used to prevent ''conception'' after unprotected intercourse has already occurred. It is not intended for use as a primary method of contraception and is most appropriate as a back-up method. Between 2006 and 2010, about 1 in 9 women of reproductive age in the US report having used emergency contraception. Emergency contraception can involve the administration of hormones or the insertion of an ''intrauterine device'' (''IUD'').' contraception,  pregnancy prevention,  fertility control, and  
family planning.
	"
What is emergency hormonal contraception (morning after pill)?,"'Emergency hormonal contraception is sometimes called ""the morning after pill"" or ""postcoital contraception,"" although these are not the preferred terms, and actually can be misleading. ''It is actually a short course of the hormones found in ''oral contraceptives'' taken at a high dose.'' The exact regimen (the number of pills and the number of days) depends on the type of oral ''contraceptive'' used.'  "
How does the morning after pill work?,"'Depending upon the time during the ''menstrual cycle'' that the emergency contraceptives are taken, these may prevent pregnancy by blocking the implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterus, by inhibiting ''ovulation'', or by interfering with fertilization of the egg. '  To be considered a possible candidate for emergency contraceptive pills a woman should take the medication within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, 
although there is some evidence that they may be effective in the 5 days 
following intercourse.  Because the pills may be taken up to 72 hours later, the 
term ""morning-after pill"" is misleading.  However, the pills are most effective 
when taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse. The only known contraindication to emergency contraception is pregnancy, so a woman must not be pregnant when these methods are used. 
	 Emergency hormonal contraception may be taken on any day of the menstrual cycle. 
	"
What are the side effects of the morning after pill?,"'Neither a physical examination nor any laboratory tests are required prior to use of the emergency hormonal contraception. It can be taken at any time during the menstrual cycle, and the next ''menstrual period'' typically occurs within one week of the expected time. The timing of the subsequent menses is, to some extent, dependent upon the time in the cycle at which the emergency contraceptive was taken.' There are no serious side effects, but the pills may cause 
	nausea and vomiting in some women. 
	 These side effects may be controlled by taking an 
	anti-nausea drug such as dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). 
	 Frequently a doctor will give a prescription nausea medication, such as 
	prochlorperazine (Compazine), at the same time as the emergency contraceptive pill. 
	 A woman may also experience breast tenderness and a temporary disruption of her menstrual cycle. One type of emergency hormonal contraception is available without a prescription in the US for people aged 17 or older (proof of ID is required for purchase). 
	 It is also available for younger
	teens with parental permission."
"What is the dosage, and what types of the morning after pill are available?","'The most common type of emergency hormonal contraception involves the administration of the ''progesterone'' hormone ''levonorgestrel'' in two doses (marketed as ''Plan B'' in the U.S.).''Another formulation for emergency hormonal contraception uses estrogen along with levonorgestrel, but levonorgestrel-only medication may be more effective and causes less nausea compared to estrogen-containing products.''Clinical trials'' using low doses of ''mifepristone'' (known earlier as RU-486, sometimes called ""the abortion pill"") have shown that this agent is extremely effective as an emergency contraceptive when taken prior to ovulation, but it has not been approved for this use in the US. Mifepristone (''Mifeprex'"") has been approved, in much higher doses, for terminating a pregnancy of less than 49 days' duration and must be taken under a physician's supervision.""'Another type of anti-progestin medication that is similar to mifepristone in its structure and actions is known as ulipristal acetate. Ulipristal acetate (Ella) is marketed for emergency contraception in Europe and was approved by the US FDA in August 2010 for use in the US for emergency contraception up to 120 hours after intercourse. It is available by prescription only.''Although effectiveness of the oral contraceptives are dependent to some extent upon how soon after unprotected intercourse they are taken, efficacy studies have generally reported a low rate of pregnancy with use of oral emergency contraception.''Emergency contraceptive pills do not protect women from ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs'').''Emergency hormonal contraception or the morning after pill is not meant to be a primary birth control method. Once the emergency is over, a woman should receive proper counseling so that she can select an effective and appropriate contraceptive method to use on a regular basis if she continues to be sexually active.' "
What is emergency IUD?,"'Like the high dose of oral hormonal contraceptive, an IUD blocks the implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterine wall. \tEmergency IUD insertion can also be used to prevent a pregnancy after unprotected sex. \t''An added advantage of emergency contraceptive use of an IUD compared to pills is that once the IUD is in place, it will provide the woman with a long-term contraceptive method if she chooses.'  Copper IUD insertion is the most effective method of emergency contraception. 
	 If the copper IUD (Paragard) is inserted within 5 days after unprotected sex, it is 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. 
	 The copper IUD has the lowest failure rate of all emergency contraception options. Emergency IUD insertion does slightly increase the risk of 
	pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). 
	 Contraindications to the use of the emergency IUD include:
known or suspected pregnancy, 
active pelvic infection, 
copper allergy, and 
certain anatomical abnormalities of the uterus.

What are the symptoms of sarcoidosis?,"'Sarcoidosis'' is a rare condition in which small patches of red and swollen tissues (granulomas) develop in organs in the body. It usually affects the ''lungs'' and skin. This condition may change the normal structure and possibly the function of an affected organ. Many people with ''sarcoidosis'' do not have any symptoms. Others have only vague symptoms which include''Organ-specific symptoms include' Weight loss Fever Loss of appetite Depression Night sweats  Sleep problems Lungs: Shortness of breath, wheezing or dry cough that may disappear over time Lymph nodes: Enlarged and sometimes tender lymph nodes, most often in the neck and chest, but sometimes under the chin, arm pits or groin Eyes: Burning, itching, tearing, redness, sensitivity to light, dryness, seeing black spots, blurred vision, reduced color vision and, in rare cases, blindness Skin: Bumps, ulcers or rarely flat areas of discolored skin that appear mostly near the nose or eyes or on the back, arms, legs and scalp; painful and tender bumps can also appear on the ankles and shins. Bones and joints: Nodules (bone growths) causing pain in the hands and feet and sometimes pain and swelling in the ankles or other joints Spleen and liver: Fever, fatigue or itching; there can be pain in the upper right part of the abdomen under the ribs. Heart: Shortness of breath, swelling in the legs, wheezing, coughing and chest pain. One may have a feeling of an irregular or fast heartbeat at times or even pass out without warning. Salivary glands: Swelling (which may make the cheeks look puffy) and an overly dry mouth and throat Nervous system: Headaches, vision problems, weakness or numbness of an arm or a leg, drooping of one side of the face, loss of movement in the arms or legs, weakness, pain or a “pins and needles” feeling"
What causes sarcoidosis?,"'Some possible triggers include:''Environmental factor or ''allergies''The disease is 10 to 17 times more common in African Americans than in Caucasians. People of Scandinavian, German, Irish or Puerto Rican origin are also more prone to the disease.''The condition is not infectious, so it\xa0cannot be\xa0passed from person to person.' The exact cause of sarcoidosis is unknown; however, research shows that having certain inherited genes makes it more likely for a person to develop sarcoidosis.  A person with a close blood relative who has sarcoidosis is nearly five times as likely to develop the condition. Sarcoidosis may be the result of an abnormal immune system, where the body starts to attack its own tissues and organs. The resulting swelling causes granulomas to develop in the organs.  Exposure to viruses, fungi or bacteria Exposure to chemicals Recent organ transplantation Age between 20 and 40 years old Female gender: The disease is slightly more common in women than in men."
Can sarcoidosis be treated?,"'There is no cure for sarcoidosis, but the disease may get better on its own over time. Sarcoidosis symptoms will often get better without treatment. Treatment is aimed at maintaining good lung function, reducing symptoms and preventing organ damage. ''Corticosteroids'' such as ''prednisone'' may reduce inflammation and slow the growth of the granulomas. Patients may be advised to follow lifestyle modifications' Eating a well-balanced diet with various fresh fruits and vegetables Drinking enough fluids every day Getting six to eight hours of sleep each night Exercising regularly and managing your weight Quitting smoking Avoiding exposure to dust, chemicals, fumes, gases, toxic inhalants and other substances that can harm your lungs Avoiding excessive amounts of calcium-rich foods (such as dairy products, oranges and canned salmon with bones), vitamin D and sunlight"
What is the mortality rate in sarcoidosis and how is it changing the pattern of cause of death?,"'Approximately 1% to 5% of patients with sarcoidosis die from its complications. Recent population studies have indicated that the mortality rate may be increasing over the past decade. The most prevalent lesion leading to death was advanced lung involvement (22/28 patients or 78%) with various late complications such as cardiorespiratory failure, gram-negative pneumonias and ''fungal infections''. Patients who died of central nervous system and cardiac sarcoidosis were younger and their clinical course was shorter. Sarcoidosis is associated with autoimmune diseases, ''pulmonary embolism'' and ''cancer''; however, the underlying mechanisms linking the diseases continues to be debated.' "

What is pediatric septic arthritis?,"'Pediatric ''septic arthritis'' is a painful infection that can affect a child’s joint tissues and synovial fluid which lubricates the joints. ''Septic arthritis'' is more common in children than adults, and most often affects large joints in the lower body, though it can affect any joint.' "
What is the most common cause of septic arthritis?,"'Septic ''arthritis'' can be caused by bacterial, fungal or viral infections. ''Staphylococcus aureus'', a type of bacteria which normally inhabits the human skin, is the most common cause of septic ''arthritis'' in infants.''Haemophilus influenzae'' type B was the most common cause of septic ''arthritis in children'', before the development and widespread use of ''vaccines'' to prevent this bacterial infection.''Some of the other bacterial causes include:' Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which commonly causes gonococcal arthritis in adolescents Streptococcus pneumoniae Community-acquired methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA-CA) Escherichia coli Kingella kingae Group A and B streptococci"
How does a child get septic arthritis?,"'A child may develop septic arthritis when microorganisms from infection in other parts of the body travel through the blood and infect the joint space. Septic arthritis in the hip and shoulder joints is very often consequent to ''osteomyelitis'', a bone infection, in the adjoining long bones such as femur or humerus. Infection may also develop from direct injury to the joint or after a surgery.' "
Is septic arthritis an emergency?,"'Septic arthritis in infants and children is an emergency that requires immediate treatment. Delay in diagnosis and treatment can result in irreversible damage to the joint. Septic arthritis can:' Destroy the cartilage in the joint Affect growth of the bone Cause dislocation of the joint Lead to sepsis, which can be fatal"
How is septic arthritis diagnosed?,"'Symptoms of septic arthritis include:''Symptoms in an infant may be subtle and may also be diagnostic of certain other conditions that affect the joints, such as:''Septic arthritis is considered a 99.6% possibility if all four of the following clinical factors are positive:''Following are the tests a child typically undergoes for a definitive diagnosis of septic arthritis:''In adolescents, if gonococcal arthritis is suspected, swabs from cervix/vagina in girls or urethral discharge in boys are tested. If sexual abuse is suspected, samples from rectum and pharynx are tested, in addition. The clinicians are obliged to report to the authorities and preserve all records as possible legal evidence.''Needle aspiration is the most important diagnostic test for septic arthritis. A needle aspiration test involves the insertion of a hollow needle directly into the joint to extract synovial fluid for testing.''Peripheral joints may be aspirated with local anesthesia, but deep joints such as hips are aspirated with the child under sedation or general anesthesia, using ''ultrasound'' guidance.' Joint pain Joint swelling Redness and warmth in the joint Fever and chills Transient synovitis: Inflammation of a joint from viral infection Lyme arthritis: Caused by Lyme disease Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease: Hip disorder from disrupted blood flow Fever Inability to bear weight on the joint Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 40 mm/hour Serum white blood cell (WBC) count above 12,000/microliter WBC count: WBC is usually elevated, but normal range in an infant does not rule out septic arthritis. ESR value: ESR  is elevated and returns to normal after the infection clears. C-reactive protein (CRP): CRP is elevated and returns to normal after the infection clears. CRP level is more sensitive than ESR and is a good indicator for response to treatment. Blood culture: Blood culture tests are done to identify the microorganism. Lyme titers: Lyme titers are performed to rule out Lyme arthritis in regions where Lyme disease is endemic. Radiographs: Radiographs are not greatly useful in diagnosing septic arthritis but obtained to rule out other conditions. Radionuclide scan: A type of bone scan using a radioactive chemical. Ultrasonography: To detect abnormal fluid collection in the joint. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Used only if needle aspiration of the joint does not provide a diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT): Obtained in patients with suspected abscess in the psoas muscle with negative joint aspiration culture."
How do you treat septic arthritis?,"'Immediately after the diagnosis of septic arthritis, the doctor starts the child on a course of antibiotics, typically a first- generation cephalosporin or ''clindamycin''. In regions where clindamycin-resistant ''MRSA'' ''strains'' are prevalent, ''vancomycin'' is the first option, failing which ''linezolid'' may be administered.''The length of antibiotic treatment usually depends on the severity of the septic arthritis. All patients with septic arthritis are first treated with intravenous antibiotics for a period that may vary from two days to a week. Antibiotics will be continued till the ESR and CPR levels become normal.''Periods for oral continuation of the antibiotic course typically are as follows:''The doctor may also administer ''dexamethasone'' to reduce inflammation and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') for ''pain'' relief. Resistance to antibiotics is a potential complication with antibiotic treatment.''In addition to antibiotic treatment, septic arthritis also requires a drainage procedure to remove the infected material from the joint. Drainage may be performed by three methods:''After surgery the doctor immobilizes the joint with a splint, or sling in the case of shoulder joint, till it heals. The child has follow-up tests and ''X-rays'' for one to two years to make sure that:' Two weeks for uncomplicated septic arthritis Three weeks for septic arthritis with osteomyelitis Four weeks for septic arthritis from MRSA Needle aspiration: Drainage may be performed with a hollow needle, if the infection is minimal and improving with treatment, and the joint is easily accessible for repeated aspirations, if necessary. Open drainage: Open drainage involves cutting the joint open (arthrotomy) under anesthesia in the operating room, to clean and remove the infected tissue and fluid. Open drainage may be the option for treating septic arthritis with extensive infection and osteomyelitis. Arthroscopy: Arthroscopy is a safe and effective alternative to arthrotomy. Arthroscopy is minimally invasive with tiny incisions through which the joint is irrigated and drained. The joint is stable and functions normally. The joint space has not narrowed. There is no bone tissue death (avascular necrosis). Bone growth is normal."
How long does it take to recover from septic arthritis?,"'Symptoms of septic arthritis start improving within a day or two after starting treatment, though the infection may take a few weeks to clear completely. Recovery from a surgical procedure may take several weeks and require physical therapy to improve muscle strength.' "
What are the complications of septic arthritis?,'Timely diagnosis and treatment is are the keys to complete recovery from septic arthritis. Complications from septic arthritis include the following:' Adverse effects on joint mobility. Growth plate damage in the bone can result in uneven lengths of limb or uneven gait. Permanent damage to the joint and nearby bones heightens risk for dislocation and fracture.
How does atrial fibrillation occur?,"'Atrial fibrillation'' (AF) is an abnormal ''heart'' rhythm characterized by an irregular and fast heartbeat. The upper chambers of the heart (atria) beat chaotically.\xa0 This can cause pooling and clotting of blood in the atria, instead of it emptying into the lower chamber (ventricles). AF can lead to ''stroke'', ''heart failure'', ''blood clots'', and heart-related complications.''In the United States, approximately 5 million people are affected by ''atrial fibrillation''. ''Atrial fibrillation'' classified into three types:''Most common causes leading to atrial fibrillation include:' Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: AF attacks that last for less than 24 hours Persistent atrial fibrillation: AF attacks that last for more than seven days and require treatment Long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation: AF that has continued for more than a year Heart valve disease Heart muscle disease Heart disease due to high blood pressure Heart defects at birth Heart failure Inflammation of the outer lining of the heart (pericardium) Previous heart surgery Drug and alcohol abuse Thyroid disorders Uncontrolled diabetes Chronic lung disorder Infections Genetics Snoring during sleep Medications such as theophylline, digitalis and adenosine Age over 60 years"
What are the signs of AF?,"'Frequently, persons with AF have no symptoms. Symptoms and signs of AF include:' Fast or fluttering heartbeat Shortness of breath Fatigue Chest pain or discomfort Dizziness Bulging eyes Wheezing Cold feet or hands"
How is atrial fibrillation diagnosed?,"'The tests commonly used in evaluating a patient with atrial fibrillation are:' Electrocardiogram (ECG) Laboratory tests such as complete blood cell count (CBC), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine kinase (CK), b-type natriuretic peptide, d-dimer level and digoxin level Echocardiography Computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Holter monitoring Electrophysiology studies Exercise stress test"
How is atrial fibrillation treated?,"'The goals of the treatment\xa0 of AF are''The various treatment options include drug therapy, surgery and lifestyle changes. Medications commonly used to treat atrial fibrillation are:''When drug therapy fails, procedures to treat atrial fibrillation include:''Some patients, who have had failed drug therapy and catheter ablation or with blood clots in the ''left atrium'', recent ''stroke'' and an enlarged left ''atrium'' may be suitable for surgical treatment:''Lifestyle changes for AF include:' Regaining a normal heart rhythm, Controlling heart rate, Preventing blood clots, and Mitigating the risk of stroke. Antiarrhythmic drugs: Medications such as procainamide and amiodarone help to treat irregular heartbeats. Rate control medications: Medications such as digoxin, metoprolol and verapamil control the heart rate. Anticoagulant medications: Medications such as warfarin prevent the formation of clots. Electrical cardioversion: Restoring normal heart rhythm by using electrical shock with the patient under anesthesia. Pulmonary vein ablation: Applying radiofrequency energy or freezing to excitable electrical tissue around the connections of the pulmonary vein near the atrium. Ablation of the AV node: A catheter is directed to the heart through the groin. A small area of tissue around the junction connecting the upper (atria) and lower (ventricles) chambers of heart is destroyed with radiofrequency energy. Patients with a slow heart rate may have a pacemaker installed with a pulse generator and wires that transmit electric impulses to the heart. Left atrial appendage closure: A small, ear-shaped sac present in the muscle wall of the atrium that is closed to prevent stroke. Maze procedure: This procedure involves a series of cuts made in the upper chambers of the heart to block any abnormal electrical impulse. Excision of the left atrial appendage: Surgical removal of left atrial appendage. Quit tobacco smoking Limit alcohol and caffeine intake Avoid activities that aggravate the symptoms Control blood pressure Shed extra pounds Monitor and control blood sugar levels Treat snoring problems Limit the use of cold and cough medicine"
Can a person die from atrial fibrillation?,"'Atrial fibrillation is a serious condition that, if untreated, doubles the risks of heart-related deaths and stroke. It is associated with 1.5 to 1.9-fold higher risk of death. So, it is important to control atrial fibrillation.' "
What is an antro-duodenal motility study?," An antro-duodenal motility study is used to evaluate the ability of the muscles of the stomach and the first portion of the small intestine (duodenum) to contract. Conditions in which there is abnormal contraction of the muscles of the stomach and the small intestine are referred to as motility disorders. Therefore, an antro-duodenal motility study is used to identify motility disorders."
When is an antro-duodenal motility study used?,"'An antro-duodenal motility study is used to diagnose a motility disorder of the stomach or small intestine, that is, a condition of abnormal function of the muscles of the stomach and/or small intestine. Such abnormal function usually is suspected when there are symptoms and signs of obstruction to or delayed flow of food through the stomach and ''intestines''. These symptoms usually are ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and intestinal distention (enlargement). The obstruction is a direct result of the inability of the abnormally functioning muscles to propel food through the stomach and intestines. One common cause of motility disorders of the stomach and intestines is ''diabetes mellitus''.' "
How is an antro-duodenal motility study done?," For an antro-duodenal motility study, a thin tube (one-eighth inch in diameter) is passed through the nose, down the esophagus, through the stomach and into the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. Sensors in the tube measure the amount of pressure generated when the muscles of the stomach and intestine contract and squeeze tightly around the tube; the greater the contraction of the muscles, the greater the pressure sensed by the tube. All contractions are recorded by a computer for analysis.  Contractions are recorded at rest for up to several hours and for one or two hours after a meal. Thus, a study may take up to six hours."
How are the results of an antro-duodenal motility study evaluated?,"' Normally, there are characteristic patterns of contraction of the stomach and duodenum during fasting periods and after meals. In patients with motility problems of the stomach and/or small intestine, the characteristic patterns are abnormal or completely absent. Such patients may be treated with ''drugs'' to stimulate contraction, such as ''metoclopramide'' (''Reglan''). ' "
Are there any side effects to an antro-duodenal motility study?,"'There are no important side effects; however, the tube can become quite irritating after several hours, giving the patient a ''sore throat''. Occasionally, the tube also causes nasal irritation.  Within 24 hours after the tube is removed, the irritation disappears.' "
Are there any alternatives to an antro-duodenal motility study?,"'Other tests can help with the evaluation of motility disorders, including upper gastrointestinal ''X-rays'', gastric emptying studies, and electrogastrograms. The most recent device for determining gastrointestinal motility is a radiotelemetry capsule (Smartpill) that senses the pressure generated when the stomach or intestinal muscles contract around it.  The capsule is swallowed, and it then travels through the stomach and intestines.  While it is traveling, it continually senses the pressure around it and transmits this information wirelessly to a receiver worn on the outside of the body.  Later, the data is downloaded from the recorder and analyzed.' "
What is esophageal manometry?,'Esophageal manometry is a procedure for determining how the muscles of the ''esophagus'' and the sphincter (valve) works by measuring pressures (manometry) generated by the esophageal muscles and the sphincter.' 
When is esophageal manometry used?,'Esophageal manometry is used primarily in three situations:'   To evaluate the function of the sphincter and muscles of the esophagus when there is reflux (regurgitation) of stomach acid and contents back into the esophagus (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD)  To determine the cause of problems with swallowing food (dysphagia) when an endoscopy is normal When there is chest pain that may be coming from the esophagus after the heart as a cause of chest pain has been ruled out
How is esophageal manometry performed?,"'At the start of the esophageal manometry procedure, one nostril is anesthetized with a numbing lubricant.  A flexible ''plastic'' tube approximately one-eighth inch in diameter is then passed through the anesthetized nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus as the patient swallows.  Once inside the esophagus, the tube allows the pressures generated by the esophageal muscle to be measured when the muscle is at rest and during swallows. The procedure usually takes 15 to 20 minutes.' "
How is esophageal manometry used to assist in the diagnosis of diseases and conditions?,"'The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the throat with the stomach.  When food is propelled by a swallow from the mouth into the esophagus, a wave of muscular contraction starts behind the food in the upper esophagus and travels down the entire length of the esophagus (referred to as the body of the esophagus), thus propelling the food in front of the wave through the esophagus and into the stomach.  At the upper and lower ends of the esophagus are two short areas of specialized muscle called the upper and lower esophageal sphincters. At rest (that is, when there has been no swallow) the muscle of the sphincters is active and generates pressure that prevents anything from passing through them.  As a result, material within the esophagus cannot back up into the throat, and stomach acid and contents cannot back up into the esophagus. When a swallow occurs, both the sphincters relax for a few seconds to allow food to pass through the esophagus into the stomach.''The most common use for esophageal manometry is to evaluate the lower esophageal sphincter and the muscle of the body of the esophagus in patients who have ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'').  Manometry often can identify ''weakness'' in the lower esophageal sphincter that allows stomach acid and contents to back up into the esophagus. It also may identify abnormalities in the functioning of the muscle of the esophageal body that may add to the problem of reflux.''Manometry can help diagnose several esophageal conditions that result in food sticking after it is swallowed.  For example, ''achalasia'' is a condition in which the muscle of the lower esophageal sphincter does not relax completely with each swallow.  As a result, food is trapped within the esophagus.  Abnormal function of the muscle of the body of the esophagus also may result in food sticking.  For instance, there may be failure to develop the wave of muscular contraction (as can occur in patients with ''scleroderma'') or the entire esophageal muscle may contract at one time (as in an esophageal spasm). Manometry reveals an absence of the wave in the first case and the contraction of the muscle everywhere in the esophagus at the same time, or spasm, in the second case.''The abnormal functioning of the esophageal muscle also may cause episodes of severe chest ''pain'' that can mimic heart ''pain'' (''angina'').  Such pain may occur if the esophageal muscle goes into spasm or contracts too strongly. In either case, esophageal manometry may identify the muscular abnormality.' "
What limitations are there to the use of esophageal manometry?,"""There are several situations in which esophageal manometry may not demonstrate the esophageal abnormality that is responsible for a patient's problem. For example, many patients with GERD have transient (coming and going infrequently), but prolonged relaxation (minutes rather than seconds) of the lower sphincter, as the cause of their reflux. Such relaxations may be missed in the short period during which the manometric study is being conducted. Similarly, if a patient is having infrequent episodes of chest pain due to esophageal spasm, for example, every few days or weeks, the spasm may not be seen during a short manometric study. There have been attempts to get around these problems by using portable equipment and prolonged manometry for two or more days."" "
What are the side-effects of esophageal manometry?,"'Although esophageal manometry is uncomfortable, the procedure is minimally painful because the nostril through which the tube is inserted is anesthetized.  Once the tube is in place, patients talk and breathe normally.  The side-effects of esophageal manometry are minor and include mild ''sore throat'', ''nosebleeds'"", and, uncommonly, sinus problems due to irritation and blockage of the ducts leading from the sinuses and into the nose.  Occasionally, during insertion, the tube may enter the larynx (voice box) and cause choking.  When this happens, the problem usually is recognized immediately, and the tube is rapidly removed.  Care must be used in passing the tube in patients who are unable to easily swallow on command because without a swallow to relax the upper esophageal sphincter the tube often doesn't enter the esophagus but instead may enter the larynx.""  "
Are there alternatives to esophageal manometry?,"'There are no good alternatives to esophageal manometry. Esophageal manometry is usually performed after anatomic abnormalities have been ruled out by endoscopy. The function of the muscles of the esophagus and the working of the esophageal sphincter may be assessed initially by performing a ''barium swallow''. However, a normal barium swallow will not rule out any abnormal function of the muscles of the esophagus. or the esophageal sphincter. Hence, there is truly no alternative for the esophageal manometry test.' "
"What is motion sickness (sea sickness, car sickness, altitude sickness)?","'Motion sickness'' is the feeling you get when the motion you sense with your inner ear is different from the motion you visualize. It is a common condition that occurs in some people who travel by car, train, airplane, or boat. Many people suffer from this condition if they ride on a roller coaster or other similar amusement park rides.''Although ''pregnant'' women and children are more susceptible to motion sickness, almost anyone who is traveling is at risk for motion sickness. For those people who travel on boats, seasickness can be considered a form of motion sickness. Other risk factors include the:'   Person's fear or anxiety about traveling Mode of travel Poor ventilation in the traveling vehicle The inability to see out of a window to aid orientation"
What are the symptoms of motion sickness?,'The signs and symptoms of motion sickness usually begin with a feeling of uneasiness followed by ''cold'' sweats (''sweating'') and ''dizziness''. Some people may exhibit:''Nausea'' and ''vomiting'' usually occur after these initial symptoms.'   Pale skin Increased saliva production Headache Fatigue
What causes motion sickness?,"""Motion sickness is caused by the mixed signals sent to the brain by the eyes and the inner ear (semicircular canals). If you cannot see the motion your body's feeling, or conversely, if you cannot feel the motion your eyes see, then it is likely that your brain will get mixed signals and you will develop some aspect or symptom of motion sickness.""  "
Do you need to see a doctor to treat motion sickness?,"'Most people with motion sickness do not need to see their doctor to treat it. Usually, laboratory testing is not required.' "
What home remedies help motion sickness go away?,"'Before taking these medications, read the precautions because many of these ''drugs'' have side effects, for example:''People who drive vehicles or operate heavy equipment should not take these medications.''Treatment for motion sickness can consist of simple changes in the environment , for example, getting fresh air.''Some people with motion sickness respond well to biofeedback training and relaxation techniques.''Herbs to treat motion sickness are ''ginger'', peppermint, and tea.''Some people respond to ''acupuncture''.'   Drowsiness Dry mouth Blurry vision Disorientation (occasionally)"
What medicine makes motion sickness go away? Can you cure motion sickness?,"'Most people with motion sickness can prevent it by taking medications that you put on the skin. Most drugs used to treat motion sickness can help prevent it, but it cannot be cured. ''Over-the-counter'' medications, and occasionally prescription medications, are used to relieve and in some cases prevent motion sickness. Some of the more common medications that can be used for motion sickness include:'   scopolamine (transdermal patches, Transderm-Scop) dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) meclizine (Antivert, Bonine, Meni-D, Antrizine) promethazine (Phenergan, Phenadoz, Promethegan) diphenhydramine (Benadryl) cyclizine (Marezine)"
When should I call a doctor for motion sickness?,"'Most people with motion sickness do not need to see a doctor to treat it unless you experience ''dehydration'' from persistent and intractable ''vomiting''. For most people with motion sickness, the symptoms slowly decrease and then disappear.' "
How can I prevent motion sickness?,"'Most people with motion sickness can prevent it by taking medications. Most drugs used to treat motion sickness will help prevent it rather than cure it.''There are other ways to reduce or prevent motion sickness without the use of medication. The following is a list of suggestions that may help reduce or prevent motion sickness:''There are companies that market bracelets and bands that claim they can prevent motion sickness using acupressure technology against certain pressure points that block the transmission of ''nausea'' before the brain can register it. Though these products may work for some people, most evidence is anecdotal, and large studies have not been conducted to prove efficacy.'   Eat light meals or snacks 24 hours before traveling and try to avoid big or high-fat meals. Sit toward the front of an aircraft for a smoother ride. If you're on a boat, ask for a cabin on the upper deck toward the front of the boat, and keep your eyes fixed as much as possible on the horizon or land. During car travel, sit in the front seat of the car, keep your eyes on the horizon, rest your head against the seat back, and try to hold relatively still. On planes, trains and in cars, turn the air vents toward your face. Avoid smoking. Short, shallow and rapid breathing can often contribute to motion sickness symptoms, therefore concentrate on maintaining slow and deep breathing."
Who Needs a Mouth Guard?,"'Mouth guards should be used by ''anyone -- both'' children and ''adults -- who'' playcontact sports such as football, boxing, soccer, ice hockey, basketball,lacrosse, and field hockey. However, even those participating in noncontactsports (for example, gymnastics) and any recreational activity (for example,skateboarding, mountain biking) that might pose a risk of injury to the mouthwould benefit from wearing a protective mouth guard.''Adults and children who grind their teeth at night should have a nocturnalbite plate or bite splint made to prevent tooth damage.' "
Why Use a Mouth Guard When Playing Sports?,"'Because accidents can happen during any physical activity, the advantage of using a mouth guard is that it can help limit the risk of mouth-related injuries to your lips, tongue, and soft tissues of your mouth. Mouth guards also help you avoid chipped or broken teeth, nerve damage to a tooth or even tooth loss.' "
Can I Wear a Mouth Guard if I Wear Braces?,"'Yes. Since an injury to the face could damage orthodontic brackets or otherfixed appliances, a properly fitted mouth guard may be particularly importantfor people who wear ''braces'' or have fixed ''bridge'' work. Your dentist ororthodontist can determine the mouth guard that will provide the bestprotection for your unique mouth work. An important reminder: do not wear any''retainers'' or other removable appliance during any contact sports or during anyrecreational activities that put your mouth at risk for injury.' "
How Do I Care for My Mouth Guard?,"'To care for your mouth guard:''Reviewed by the doctors at ''The ClevelandClinic Department of Dentistry''.''Reviewed by Harold Burstein, PhD, MD, on May 1, 2005''Edited by Charlotte E. Grayson Mathis, MD, on May 1, 2005''Portions of this page © The Cleveland Clinic 2000-2005' Rinse your mouth guard with cold water or with a mouth rinse before and
after each use and/or clean it with toothpaste and a toothbrush. Occasionally clean the mouthguard in cool, soapy water and rinse it
thoroughly. Place the mouth guard in a firm, perforated container to store or transport
it. This permits air circulation and helps to prevent damage. Protect the mouth guard from high temperatures -- such as hot water, hot
surfaces, or direct sunlight -- to minimize distorting its shape. Occasionally check the mouth guard for general wear. If you find holes or
tears in it or if it becomes loose or causes discomfort, replace it. Bring the mouth guard to each regularly scheduled dental visit to have your
dentist exam it."
What is Moyamoya disease? What does it mean?,"'Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disease that causes stenosis or a blockage to one or both of the primary blood vessels (internal carotid arteries) that supply the brain as they enter the skull.''Moyamoya disease was first noted in Japan in 1957 and it is seen mainly in Japan and other countries in Asia. The disease is diagnosed less frequently in Europe and North America. ""Moyamoya"" is a Japanese word that means ""puff of smoke,"" which describes the hazy and tangled appearance of the vascular collateral network (small blood vessels) that forms to compensate for the blockage.' "
Is Moyamoya disease inherited (genetic)?,"'The cause of Moyamoya disease is unknown. It is believed there may be a genetic factor, as up to 15 percent of Japanese people with Moyamoya have family members with the condition.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Moyamoya disease?,"'Moyamoya disease can occur in children and adults. There are two times the disease incidence peaks: most commonly, at about 10 years of age in children and between ages 30 to 50 in adults. Moyamoya disease may present differently in adults and children.''In adults, the most common symptoms include bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic ''strokes''). Other symptoms of Moyamoya disease in adults include:''In addition to the symptoms that can occur in adults, other symptoms of Moyamoya disease in children may include:' Lightheadedness or fainting Visual disturbances Blurred vision Loss of vision in one eye Poor vision in both eyes Inability to recognize objects Seizures Headaches Unilateral (on one side) weakness, numbness, or paralysis in your face, arm, or leg Cognitive decline Moyamoya disease in children often results in transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), also called ""ministrokes,"" and seizures. Headaches Developmental delays Problems with speech Difficulty understanding others Involuntary movements Periods of inability to move feet, legs, or arms Anemia (symptoms include fatigue and pale skin)"
What causes Moyamoya disease?,"'The cause of Moyamoya disease is unknown. In some cases, there appears to be a genetic factor and the disease seems to run in families. Other possible causes of Moyamoya disease include:'  Injuries Neurofibromatosis (nf) Procedures such as X-rays of the skull Heart surgery Chemotherapy Moyamoya syndrome is a secondary disorder that may occur in association with some conditions, such as: Infections Atherosclerosis Heart disease Vasculitis Blood disorders (such as sickle cell disease or beta thalassemia) Autoimmune conditions (such as Lupus, thyroid disorders, Sneddon syndrome) Connective tissue disorders (such as neurofibromatosis type 1 or Tuberous sclerosis) Chromosome disorders Metabolic diseases Head trauma Radiation therapy of the brain Brain tumors Down syndrome or Williams syndrome"
What are the 6 stages of Moyamoya disease?,"'There are 6 stages of Moyamoya disease, called Suzuki stages. Each stage refers to an angiographic finding (imaging of blood vessels).' Stage 1: Narrowing of carotid arteries Stage 2: Initial appearance of basal Moyamoya with dilatation of all main cerebral arteries Stage 3: Intensification of Moyamoya vessels together with reduction of flow in the middle and anterior cerebral arteries Stage 4: Minimization of Moyamoya vessels; the proximal portions of the posterior cerebral arteries become involved Stage 5: Reduction of Moyamoya vessels and absence of all main cerebral arteries Stage 6: Disappearance of Moyamoya vessels; the cerebral circulation is supplied only by the external carotid system"
What tests diagnose Moyamoya disease?,"'Along with a history and physical, imaging tests to help find the blockage and may be ordered to diagnose Moyamoya disease, including:' Computerized tomography (CT) brain scan Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the brain or spine Cerebral angiogram Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) Electroencephalography (EEG) Transcranial Doppler ultrasound"
What is the treatment for Moyamoya disease?,"'Treatment for Moyamoya disease is aimed at reducing symptoms with attempts to decrease intracranial pressure, improve blood flow in the blood vessels of the brain, and control ''seizures''.'  Surgery is generally the preferred treatment option but medications may be used if surgery is not an option. Medications include: Blood thinners (anticoagulants) such as heparin or warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) to prevent strokes Antiplatelet agents such as aspirin to help prevent future ischemic strokes Calcium channel blockers to help lower blood pressure Seizure medications"
What types of surgery treat Moyamoya disease?,"'Revascularization is a type of surgical procedure used to treat Moyamoya disease. This procedure repairs the narrowed arteries, improves blood flow, and reduces the risk of ''stroke''. Without surgery, Moyamoya is a progressive condition and patients will experience multiple strokes and a mental decline.''There are several types of revascularization procedures:''In some cases, minimally invasive procedures may be used such as ''angioplasty'' and stenting to widen a narrowed artery.' EDAS (encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis): A scalp artery is rerouted onto the surface of the brain. Over time, new blood vessels form and ideally will provide a new blood supply to the ischemic area of the brain. A modification of EDAS is pial synangiosis: Reroutes healthy scalp blood vessels to the brain, bypassing the narrowed vessels. EMS (encephalomyosynangiosis): A muscle in the temple of the forehead is partially detached. A hole is drilled in the skull and the muscle is placed onto the surface of the brain, where it will eventually produce new blood vessels. External carotid to internal carotid (EC-IC) bypass: One of the arteries in the scalp (superficial temporal artery) is attached to one of the major arteries in the brain (middle cerebral artery). Direct arterial bypass, also called STA-MCA (superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery) bypass: A blood vessel from the scalp is joined directly to a brain surface artery to transport blood directly to where it is needed. Omental transposition/transfer: The omentum, a blood-rich lining surrounding the abdominal organs, is placed over the surface of the brain so new blood vessels can generate and grow into the brain. Dural inversion: The flaps of fibrous dural tissue on the meningeal vessel, a large artery within the skull, are inverted. The outer dural surface with a large number of blood vessels comes into direct contact with the parts of the brain that need blood flow."
How successful is surgery for Moyamoya disease?,"'Full recovery from revascularization surgery for Moyamoya disease may take six to 12 months, but patients notice improvements in their symptoms almost immediately. Surgical revascularization surgery is effective in preventing both ischemic and hemorrhagic ''stroke''. Surgery for Moyamoya disease is most effective when performed before a patient suffers a ''stroke'' or hemorrhage, which may cause long-term damage.''If there has been major bleeding into the brain, there may be permanent damage that surgery cannot repair. In these cases, prompt treatment can help preserve as much brain function as possible.' "
What are the complications of surgery for Moyamoya disease?,'Complications of revascularization surgery for Moyamoya include:' Perioperative stroke Cerebral hyper perfusion syndrome Subdural hematoma Wound healing disorders
Is there a cure for Moyamoya disease? ,"'Moyamoya is a progressive disease and without treatment patients will not improve. Moyamoya itself is not curable, but revascularization surgery that allows for alternative blood supply to the brain prevents symptoms and can reduce the risk of future strokes.' "
Is Moyamoya disease fatal?,"'Without surgery, most patients with Moyamoya disease will suffer from multiple stokes and a mental decline because of the progressive narrowing of arteries. If left untreated, Moyamoya disease can be fatal as the result of intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain).' "
What is the prognosis and life-expectancy for Moyamoya disease?,"'In general, the earlier patients are diagnosed and treated, the better the outcome. Patients who are diagnosed early and treated promptly with surgical intervention can have a normal life expectancy.''Moyamoya disease is progressive, and patients who are not treated often suffer cognitive and neurologic decline due to repeated ischemic ''stroke'' or hemorrhage.' "
What is MPS I (mucopolysaccharidosis type 1)?,"'MSP I (mucopolysaccharidosis type 1) is the most common type of metabolic disorder caused by deficiencies in lysosomal enzymes. Lysosomal enzymes are contained within the lysosomes of cells, organelles that serve to break down many different kinds of substances. ''MSP I is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes alpha-L-iduronidase on chromosome 4 that results in deficient lysosomal enzymes that are needed to degrade glycosaminoglycan, a major constituent of connective tissue. ''There are many different mutations in this gene. The various mutations cause MPS IH (Hurler syndrome), MPS IS (Scheie syndrome) and MPS IH/S (Hurler/Scheie syndrome), and others. ''This article will describe in general MPS I as a single syndrome since MPS IS, MPS IH/S and MPS IH are considered clinical manifestations that range from least severe (MPS IS) to most severe (MPS IH).'

What causes MPS I?,"'The cause of MPS I are genetic mutations on chromosome 4 that lead to a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme a-L-iduronidase and in turn, leads to mucopolysaccharides accumulating in tissues and organs that interfere with their activity and development.' "
How is MPS I inherited?,"'MPS I is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Consequently, nearly all individuals with MPS I receive a recessive gene from each parent. If both of the parents possess the recessive gene, the chances are about 1in 4 that a child will receive an autosomal recessive gene from each parent and develop MPS I.' "
Which specialties of health-care professionals treat MPS I?,"'Pediatricians are usually the first to notice MPS I. Specialists that may be consulted include geneticists,''emergency medicine specialists'', pulmonologists, neurologists, cardiologists, orthopedists, ophthalmologists, rheumatologists, audiologists, surgeons, child psychologists and genetic counselors.' "

What is the life expectancy for a person with MPS I?,"'The life expectancy is highly variable with MPS I. The life expectancy is related to the severity of the disease. For example, individuals with the mildest form of MPS I (MPS IS) may have a reasonably normal lifespan, while those with intermediate (MPS IH/S) usually live to teen age or early adulthood. Those with severe MPS I (MPS IH or Hurler syndrome) rarely live longer than 10 years.' "

What is Hunter syndrome?,"'Hunter syndrome is a very rare X - linked recessive inherited disease. Hunter syndrome is a lysosomal storage disease caused by deficient or absent enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S). This causes the accumulation of heparin sulfate and dermatan sulfate to accumulate in body tissues. Injury to various organs lead to the symptoms from the disease. Hunter syndrome is also termed Mucopolysaccharidosis II or MPS II.' "
What are the signs symptoms of Hunter syndrome?,"'The symptoms of Hunter syndrome usually are not present at birth, but begin in young children ages about 2-4, and may range from mild to severe. Symptoms include:'   Facial changes such as thickening of 
the lips, nostrils flaring and broadening of the nose Head enlargement (macrocephaly) Tongue protrusion Hoarseness and/or deepening of the 
voice Changes in the bones produces abnormal 
bone size and/or bone shape Joint stiffness Small whitish growths on the skin Enlarged internal organs Distended abdomen Diarrhea Delayed development (for example, child 
does not meet normal development such as talking or normal motor skills like 
walking) Behavior that becomes aggressive Reduced or stunted growth"
What causes Hunter syndrome?,"'The cause of Hunter syndrome is an abnormal gene X chromosome that is inherited from the mother. This genetic abnormality allows mucopolysaccharides to accumulate in large amounts in cells, the blood and in connective tissues. This accumulation causes damage to cells and organs. It is a progressive disease that usually causes a shortened lifespan and major developmental abnormalities. Hunter syndrome occurs almost exclusively in males.' "
Who gets Hunter syndrome?,"'The two major risk factors for Hunter syndrome are a family history of Hunter syndrome, and being male, since predominantly males are affected. Females rarely get the disease because they inherit two X chromosomes so that even if one is defective, the other X chromosome with functioning genes usually can compensate for the abnormality.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat Hunter syndrome?,"'There are a number of physician specialties that may treat Hunter syndrome. Treatment is geared toward managing the symptoms and complications of the disease. There is no cure for this progressive disease. Specialties of physicians that may be involved in caring for persons with Hunter syndrome include pediatric pulmonologists, critical-care specialists, ''emergency medicine'' specialists, orthopedists, geneticists, rheumatologists, internal medicine specialists, neurologists, surgeons and child psychologists. If the child survives to adulthood, similar specialists that treat adults may be consulted.' "
How is Hunter syndrome diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis of Hunter syndrome is sometimes difficult because of its slow onset and overlapping symptoms with other childhood problems. Early signs that suggest a diagnosis include facial changes in the child. The pediatrician then usually completes a detailed personal family history and physical examination of the individual. Blood, urine, and/or tissue samples can be tested for either the deficient enzyme or excess mucopolysaccharides. Definitive diagnosis is done by a genetic analysis of the child's X chromosome(s). There is no routine ""'newborn'' screening available to diagnose Hunter syndrome. However, in families with known Hunter syndrome, prenatal testing of the ''amniotic fluid'' or placental tissue may be available and can verify the diagnosis in a fetus.' "
What is the treatment for Hunter syndrome?,"'Currently, treatment is geared toward managing symptoms and complications as there is no cure for this progressive disease. Treatments depend on the organ(s) involved and can include assistance with ''breathing'"", physical therapy to maintain functions, drainage of fluids to build up in the brain and/or spinal cord, heart valve replacement and other treatments such as behavior management. Some physicians utilize specific enzyme therapy to replace child's deficient enzymes. The treatment is termed enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using an IV – infused enzyme (Elaprase). It is still being refined along with gene therapy to replace the abnormal part of the X chromosome."" "
What are the complications of Hunter syndrome?,"'Complications of Hunter syndrome are:' Respiratory complications (thickened 
tongue can obstruct breathing) Skeletal problems (abnormal bone 
development and joint problems) Connective tissue (accumulation of 
mucopolysaccharides can cause swelling) Heart (thickened tissue resulting in 
vessel narrowing) Brain (hydrocephalus) Nervous system (thickened membranes 
impede nerve functions) Reduced ability to recover from most 
illnesses"
What is the life-expectancy for a person with Hunter syndrome?,"'The life expectancy the person with Hunter syndrome is reduced and ranges from about 10 to 20 years of age. However, with mild disease, some individuals live into adulthood. Obstruction of breathing or ''heart disease'' are the major causes of death.' "
What are other names for Hunter syndrome?,"'Hunter syndrome is also known as ''Some researchers use subtypes such as MPS IIA and MPS IIB (MPS IIA is severe disease while MPS IIB is mild disease).''There are two other terms that are sometimes confused with Hunter syndrome. ' Mucopolysaccharidosis II,  MPS II, and  MPS 
Disorder II.  The first is Bow Hunter Syndrome, a problem when a person rotates their head and 
causes circulation ischemia in the dominant vertebral artery that produces 
attacks of 
	vertigo, nystagmus and
	ataxia (inability to walk normally). 
	 The 
second term is Hurler Hunter syndrome. This term also is known as Hurler 
syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis I and MPS I), and is closely related to Hunter 
syndrome because it also is an inherited disease that results in a lack of an 
enzyme called alpha- L-iduronidase, which produces similar symptoms and 
outcomes to Hunter syndrome."
What is a complete blood count (CBC) test?,"'The complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most commonly ordered blood tests. The complete blood count is the calculation of the cellular (formed elements) of blood. Special machines that analyze the different components of blood in less than a minute generally determine these calculations.''A major portion of the complete blood count is the measure of the concentration of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the blood.' "
How much does a CBC test cost?,"'The cost for a\xa0complete blood count test or CBC test varies greatly, and can run\xa0from $10.00 up to $2,700 depending on what type of insurance you have, and whether or not you have it.' "
What is the complete blood count test used for?,"'Your doctor may order this test for a variety of reasons. It may be a part of a routine check-up or screening, or as a follow-up test to monitor certain treatments.' It can also be done as a part of an evaluation based on a patient's symptoms and overall health. To diagnose a medical condition: for example, a high WBC count (leukocytosis) may signify an infection somewhere in the body or, less commonly, it may signify an underlying malignancy. A low WBC count (leukopenia) may point toward a bone marrow problem or related to some medications, such as chemotherapy. A doctor may order the test to follow the WBC count in order to monitor the response to treatment for an infection. The components in the differential of the WBC count also have specific functions and if altered, they may provide clues for particular conditions. To monitor a medical condition: a low red blood cell count or low hemoglobin may suggest anemia, which can have many causes. Possible causes of high red blood cell count or hemoglobin (erythrocytosis) may include bone marrow disease or low blood oxygen levels (hypoxia). To monitor a medical treatment: a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) may be the cause of prolonged bleeding or other medical conditions that affect the production of platelets in the bone marrow. Conversely, a high platelet count (thrombocytosis) may point toward a bone marrow problem or severe inflammation."
What does a complete blood count test measure?,"'The complete blood count, or CBC, lists a number of many important values. Typically, it includes the following:''Mean corpuscular volume (MCV):'' is the average volume of a red blood cell. This is a calculated value derived from the hematocrit and red cell count. Normal range may fall between 80 to 100 femtoliters (a fraction of one millionth of a liter).''Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH): ''is the average amount of hemoglobin in the average red cell. This is a calculated value derived from the measurement of hemoglobin and the red cell count. Normal range is 27 to 32 picograms.''Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC): ''is the average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of red cells. This is a calculated volume derived from the hemoglobin measurement and the hematocrit. Normal range is 32% to 36%.''Mean Platelet Volume (MPV): ''is the average size of platelets in a volume of blood.' White blood cell count (WBC or leukocyte count) WBC differential count Red blood cell count (RBC or erythrocyte count) Hematocrit (Hct) Hemoglobin (Hbg) Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) Red cell distribution width (RDW) Platelet count Mean Platelet Volume (MPV)"
What are the normal ranges for a complete blood count test?,"'The values generally included:''Red blood cells are the most common cell type in blood and people have millions of them in their blood circulation. They are smaller than white blood cells but larger than platelets.' White blood cell count (WBC) is the number of white blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4,300 and 10,800 cells per cubic millimeter (cmm). This can also be referred to as the leukocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.3 to 10.8 x 109 cells per liter. White blood cell (WBC) differential count. The white blood count is comprised of several different types that are differentiated, or distinguished, based on their size and shape. The cells in a differential count are granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. Red cell count (RBC) signifies the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally from 4.2 to 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 to 5.9 x 1012 cells per liter. Platelet count measures the number of platelets in a volume of blood and usually ranges between 150,000 to 400,000 per cmm."
"What is the function of the red and white blood cells, and platelets?","'The cells in the CBC (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) have unique functions. Generally speaking, white blood cells are an essential part of the immune system and help the body fight infections. Each different component of the white blood cell (the WBC differential) plays a specific role in the immune system.''Red blood cells are essential in transporting oxygen to all the cells in the body to serve their functions. The hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cell is the vehicle for the transportation of oxygen. Platelets are a part of the blood clotting system in the body and help in preventing bleeding.' "
What is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)?,"'An MRI or magnetic resonance imaging is a radiology techinque scan that uses magnetism, radio waves, and a computer to produce images of body structures. The MRI scanner is a tube surrounded by a giant circular magnet. The patient is placed on a moveable bed that is inserted into the magnet. The magnet creates a strong magnetic field that aligns the protons of hydrogen atoms, which are then exposed to a beam of radio waves. This spins the various protons of the body, and they produce a faint signal that is detected by the receiver portion of the MRI scanner. A computer processes the receiver information, which produces an image.''MRI image and resolution is quite detailed, and it can detect tiny changes of structures within the body. For some procedures, contrast agents, such as gadolinium, are used to increase the accuracy of the images.' "
What are the uses for an MRI?,"""An MRI scan can be used as an extremely accurate method of disease detection throughout the body and is most often used after the other testing fails to provide sufficient information to confirm a patient's diagnosis. In the head, ""'trauma'' to the brain can be seen as bleeding or swelling. Other abnormalities often found include brain aneurysms, ''stroke'', tumors of the brain, as well as tumors or inflammation of the spine.''Neurosurgeons use an MRI scan not only in defining brain anatomy, but also in evaluating the integrity of the spinal cord after trauma. It is also used when considering problems associated with the vertebrae or intervertebral discs of the spine. An MRI scan can evaluate the structure of the heart and ''aorta'', where it can detect aneurysms or tears. MRI scans are not the first line of imaging test for these issues or in cases of trauma.''It provides valuable information on glands and organs within the abdomen, and accurate information about the structure of the joints, soft tissues, and bones of the body. Often, surgery can be deferred or more accurately directed after knowing the results of an MRI scan.' "
What are the risks and side effecs of an MRI?,"'An MRI scan is a painless radiology technique that has the advantage of avoiding x-ray radiation exposure. There are no known side effects of an MRI scan. The benefits of an MRI scan relate to its precise accuracy in detecting structural abnormalities of the body.''Patients who have any metallic materials within the body must notify their physician prior to the examination or inform the MRI staff. Metallic chips, materials, surgical clips, or foreign material (artificial joints, metallic bone plates, or prosthetic devices, etc.) can significantly distort the images obtained by the MRI scanner. Patients who have heart pacemakers, metal implants, or metal chips or clips in or around the eyeballs cannot be scanned with an MRI because of the risk that the magnet may move the metal in these areas. Similarly, patients with ''artificial heart'' valves, metallic ear implants, bullet fragments, and ''chemotherapy'' or ''insulin'' pumps should not have MRI scanning.''During the MRI scan, patient lies in a closed area inside the magnetic tube. Some patients can experience a claustrophobic sensation during the procedure. Therefore, patients with any history of ''claustrophobia'' should relate this to the practitioner who is requesting the test, as well as the radiology staff. A mild sedative can be given prior to the MRI scan to help alleviate this feeling. It is customary that the MRI staff will be nearby during MRI scan. Furthermore, there is usually a means of communication with the staff (such as a buzzer held by the patient) which can be used for contact if the patient cannot tolerate the scan.'  "
How do I prepare for an MRI? How is it performed?,"'All metallic objects on the body are removed prior to obtaining an MRI scan. Occasionally, patients will be given a sedative medication to decrease ''anxiety'' and relax the patient during the MRI scan. MRI scanning requires that the patient lie still for best accuracy. Patients lie within a closed environment inside the magnetic machine. Relaxation is important during the procedure and patients are asked to breathe normally. Interaction with the MRI technologist is maintained throughout the test. There are loud, repetitive clicking noises which occur during the test as the scanning proceeds. Occasionally, patients require injections of liquid intravenously to enhance the images which are obtained.The MRI scanning time depends on the exact area of the body studied, but ranges from half an hour to an hour and a half.' "
When do I receive the results of an MRI?,"'After the MRI scanning is completed, the computer generates visual images of the area of the body that was scanned. These images can be transferred to film (hard copy). A radiologist is a doctor who is specially trained to interpret images of the body. The interpretation is transmitted in the form of a report to the practitioner who requested the MRI scan. The doctor can then discuss the results with the patient and/or family.' "
What does an MRI look like (pictures)?,'This patient had a ''herniated disc'' between vertebrae L4 and L5. The resulting surgery was a discectomy' 
What new MRI scanners available?,"'Scientists are developing newer MRI scanners that are smaller, portable devices. These new scanners apparently can be most useful in detecting infections and tumors of the soft tissues of the hands, ''feet'', elbows, and knees. The application of these scanners to medical practice is now being tested.' "
What is MRSA?,"'MRSA'' is the short form of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' and refers to ''strains'' of gram-positive coccal-shaped (round) bacteria that are resistant to several antibiotics. ''MRSA'' causes mainly skin infections in nonhospitalized people; in hospitalized patients, it can cause ''sepsis'', surgical site infections, and ''pneumonia''. All of these infections may be difficult to treat because of ''MRSA'""'s resistance to antibiotics.""  "
Is MRSA contagious?,"'MRSA'' is very ''contagious'' under certain circumstances (when skin alterations or damage are present); spread occurs through person-to-person contact with a ''skin infection'' or even indirect contact, such as contact with a ''MRSA'""-infected person's clothing or towels or even from benches in gyms. All ""'MRSA'' needs to establish itself is a small break in the skin or mucosa. This is important because no breaks means no infection; for example, MRSA skin-infected or MRSA-colonized ''pregnant'' females seldom infect their fetus or infants. However, many activities such as kissing, saliva exchange, and sexual contact, although somewhat less likely to transfer MRSA to another, can cause infection if the skin or mucosa is damaged. Hospitalized patients, if they have MRSA ''pneumonia'', may transfer the organisms to others through the air by contaminated droplets. Bodies of people who die from MRSA infections often have viable MRSA on their surfaces, and these organisms can infect other people. The incubation period for MRSA ranges from one to 10 days.' "
What is the incubation period for MRSA?,"'For most ''staph'' infections, including MRSA, the incubation period is often indefinite if the organisms are colonizing (not infecting) an individual (see above). However, the incubation period for MRSA often ranges from one to 10 days if it enters broken skin or damaged mucous membranes.' "
What is the contagious period for MRSA?,"'As long as there are viable MRSA bacteria in or on an individual who is colonized with these bacteria or infected with the organisms, MRSA is ''contagious''. Consequently, a person colonized with MRSA (one who has the organism normally present in or on the body) may be contagious for an indefinite period of time. In addition, MRSA organisms can remain viable on some surfaces for about two to six months if they are not washed or sterilized.' "
How will I know I have MRSA?,"'Most MRSA skin infections first appear as a reddish bump that quickly becomes swollen, painful, and warm and contains or drains pus; they can occur almost anywhere on the body. The infected person may also develop a ''fever''. Hospitalized patients may show surgical ''wound'' infections, ''pneumonia'', or ''sepsis''. However, the definitive way to diagnose MRSA is to have a doctor culture the MRSA bacteria (skin lesion, biopsy, or nasal swab) and then show the organisms are resistant to several different antibiotics.' "
How is MRSA transmitted?,"'MRSA in the community is spread from person to person by direct contact; in addition, indirect contact is also a means of spread because the bacteria can survive on objects like towels, benches, shaving equipment, and other objects. For a person to become infected, MRSA usually needs to have a breach (''abrasion'', cut, ''rash'', or ''puncture'"") in the skin. Hospital spread of MRSA can include the above methods in addition to spread by blood, saliva, and/or droplets in the air that can land on people's skin or other surface if the person has ""'pneumonia''. Hospitalized patients who are MRSA carriers or infected with MRSA usually are put under isolation conditions (for example, gloves, masks, gowns, and minimized physical contact by visitors) to help prevent MRSA spread.''People who are colonized with MRSA far less likely to transmit the organisms to others; transmission is more likely if the patient is infected with MRSA.' "
How will I know I am cured of MRSA?,"'Many people are cured of MRSA when the symptoms resolve. However, a few individuals (about two of 100 people) carry MRSA as either transient organisms or colonizing organisms in some body areas such as the nasal mucosa but show no signs of infection. Occasionally, people can be cured of their carrier situation by topical antibiotics when they no longer are positive for MRSA cultures. ''Prevention'' of MRSA infections may be accomplished by good hand washing and body cleaning hygiene practices, especially after playing contact sports or if people live in crowded areas (dorms, camps, or barracks, for example). Although cleaning clothing and other items helps reduce the chance of getting MRSA, using a disinfecting agent like bleach, when feasible, offers an even better chance of prevention.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about MRSA?,"'If you know you have had person-to-person contact with someone diagnosed with MRSA and you begin to develop any symptoms, contact a physician urgently. If you develop symptoms or signs that might be due to MRSA, contact a medical ''caregiver'' to help diagnose your condition with tests for MRSA. If you are being treated for an infection with antibiotics and the infection is not better or is getting worse and/or you are developing ''fevers'', you should urgently or emergently, depending on the severity of symptoms, see a physician.'  "
What is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)?,"'Staphylococcus aureus'' (SA) is a common skin bacterium. It is sometimes called staph, and it most often causes skin and soft tissue infections. Although ''S. aureus'' has been causing staph infections as long as humans have existed, MRSA has only been around since 1961. Methicillin was one of the first antibiotics used to treat ''S. aureus'' and other infections. ''S. aureus'' developed a gene mutation that allowed it to escape being killed by methicillin, so it became resistant to methicillin. That makes it harder to treat someone who gets an infection. Stronger, more expensive, or intravenous antibiotics may be needed.''Since the 1960s, MRSA has picked up more resistance to different antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics has increased resistance in MRSA and other infectious bacteria because resistance genes (the genes that code for resistance) can be passed from bacteria to bacteria.' "
What is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)? (Continued),"'A deadly complication of MRSA is a deep infection, ''necrotizing fasciitis'', which causes rapid spread and destruction of human tissues. Some but not all ''strains'' of MRSA are more likely to behave like ""''flesh-eating bacteria''."" It is impossible to predict which MRSA infection will be ""flesh-eating.""' "
How many strains of MRSA are there?,"'In general, there are two major strains of MRSA, ""community acquired” or CA-MRSA and ""hospital acquired"" or HA-MRSA. CA-MRSA differs from HA-MRSA in that it is often resistant to fewer antibiotics. It is by definition picked up outside of the hospital or health care institution. CA-MRSA strains are often able to cause more severe and deeper infections in healthy people than HA-MRSA. Very often, CA-MRSA skin infections are so severe and sudden that people believe a spider bit them. MRSA bacteria often have a variety of ""virulence factors"" that are responsible for this. Some of these are ""leucocidin"" proteins that are toxic to immune cells that fight infections or cause more inflammation and tissue damage; Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) protein is a well-known example that is produced by the USA300 strain of CA-MRSA. The ""phenol-soluble modulin"" (PSM) proteins are a recently discovered class of leukocidins that increase the likelihood of causing severe disease in various ways.''Most HA-MRSA infections have been due to the USA100 strain. HA-MRSA is more likely to affect people in health care institutions who may have weaker immune systems due to other illnesses. HA-MRSA is less likely to cause problems for healthy people in the community.' "
What does a MRSA infection look like?,"'On the skin, MRSA infection may begin as redness or a ''rash'' with a pus-filled ''pimple'' or ''boil''. It may progress to an open, inflamed area of skin that may weep pus or drain fluid. In some instances, it may appear as an ''abscess'', a swollen, tender area, often with reddish skin covering. When the abscess is cut open or spontaneously bursts open, pus drains from the area. If the infection is severe or may be spreading into the blood (''bacteremia''), ''fevers'' and shaking ''chills'' may occur.'  "
What are the risk factors for MRSA infections?,"'People with higher risk of MRSA infection are those with skin breaks (''scrapes'', cuts, or surgical wounds) or hospital patients with intravenous lines, ''burns'', or skin ulcers. In addition, MRSA may infect people with weak immune systems (infants, the elderly, people with ''diabetes'' or ''cancer'', or ''HIV''-infected individuals) or people with chronic skin diseases (''eczema'' and ''psoriasis'') or chronic illnesses. People with ''pneumonia'' (lung infection) due to MRSA can transmit MRSA by droplets produced during coughing. Patients in health care facilities are often in these risk categories, so special precautions recommended by CDC may be posted on a sign at the room entrance. Examples include ""droplet precautions"" -- if the patient has ''pneumonia'', disposable masks, gowns, and gloves must be used by people who enter the room, and they must be taken off before leaving. ""Contact precautions"" may be posted recommending gowns and gloves only if the patient has ''skin infection''. Precautions must be followed as posted by both health care professionals and visitors to keep from spreading MRSA to other patients or people at risk of serious infection.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a MRSA infection?,"""The incubation period (time between infection and start of symptoms) is variable and may depend on the particular strain of MRSA and the person's immunity. Most MRSA infections are skin and soft tissue infections that produce the following signs and symptoms:""'All of these skin infections are painful.''A major problem with MRSA (and occasionally other staph infections) is that occasionally the skin infection can spread to almost any other organ in the body. When this happens, it is a deep or invasive infection that can spread to the blood and infect internal organs. MRSA infections can cause complications such as infection of heart valves (''endocarditis''), ''gangrene'' or death of the soft tissues (''necrotizing fasciitis''), and bone or joint infections (''osteomyelitis'' or ''septic arthritis''). This can be deadly. ''Fever'', chills, ''low blood pressure'', ''joint pains'', severe ''headaches'', ''shortness of breath'', and ''sunburn''-like rash over most of the body are symptoms of ''sepsis'' (blood poisoning). This requires emergency medical attention.' Cellulitis, an infection of the skin or the fat and tissues under the skin, usually starting as small red bumps in the skin. It includes redness, swelling of the tissues, warmth, and tenderness. Boils (pus-filled infections of hair follicles) Abscesses (collections of pus in or under the skin) Sty (an infection of an oil gland of the eyelid) Carbuncles (infections larger than an abscess, usually with several openings to the skin) Impetigo (a skin infection with pus-filled blisters) Rash like a sunburn or skin redness (skin appears to be reddish or have red-colored areas)"
Is a MRSA infection contagious?,"'MRSA skin and soft tissue infections can be ''contagious'' or spread from person to person by contact with the skin, pus, or infected body fluids of a person who has MRSA. Some people may be ""carriers"" of MRSA. In other words, the bacteria live\xa0on their skin or in the nostrils. It may cause no problems, or it may cause infections on that person\'s body or be transmitted to other people. It is not unusual for people in the community who are in frequent close contact with or who live with a person who has MRSA to also become carriers of MRSA. MRSA is very common in the community, especially in children and even pets.' "
How is a MRSA infection transmitted or spread?,"'There are two major ways people become infected with MRSA. The first is physical contact with someone who is either infected or is a carrier (people who are not infected but are colonized with the bacteria on their body) of MRSA. The second way is for people to physically contact MRSA from objects such as door handles, floors, sinks, or towels that have been touched by a MRSA-infected person or carrier. Normal skin tissue in people usually does not allow MRSA infection to develop; however, if there are cuts, abrasions, or other breaks in the skin such as ''psoriasis'' (a chronic inflammatory skin disease with dry patches, redness, and white scales), MRSA (or any ''S. aureus'') may proliferate. Many otherwise healthy people, especially children and young adults, do not notice small skin imperfections or scrapes and may not take precautions about skin contacts. This is the likely reason MRSA outbreaks occur in diverse types of people such as families, school team players (like football players or wrestlers), dormitory residents, and armed-services personnel in constant close contact.' "
What tests do medical professionals use to diagnose a MRSA infection?,"'Most doctors start with a complete history and physical exam of the patient to identify any skin changes that may be due to MRSA, especially if the patient or caretaker mentions a close association with a person who has been diagnosed with MRSA. If possible, a sample of pus from a wound, blood, or urine is sent to a microbiology lab and cultured for ''S. aureus''. Deep infections (such as bone) may require removal of a piece of tissue for testing (biopsy). If ''S. aureus'' is isolated (grown on a petri plate), the bacteria are then exposed to different antibiotics, including methicillin. ''S. aureus'' bacteria that grow well when methicillin is in the culture are termed MRSA, and the patient is diagnosed as MRSA-infected. Often there is no material to culture, and doctors treat the person with antibiotics that kill MRSA as well as more common bacteria until more information is available. This is called empiric therapy, meaning that doctors make their best guess on what bacteria are likely to be the cause of infection, until the bacteria have been definitively identified.''Some hospitals may screen patients for carrying MRSA, so that precautions can be taken to avoid spreading MRSA. The same procedure is done by swabbing the skin or inside the nose. These tests help distinguish MRSA infections from other skin changes that often appear initially similar to MRSA, such as ''spider bites'' or skin changes that occur with ''Lyme disease''. Many MRSA infections get mistaken for a ''spider bite''. This can cause delayed or incorrect treatment and progression of the MRSA infection.''There are rapid screening tests that can detect the presence of MRSA DNA material (''polymerase chain reaction'', ''PCR'') in a blood sample in as little as two hours. The test is able to determine whether the genetic material is from MRSA or from less resistant forms of staph bacteria. It may allow hospitals to start precautions early. It may also allow doctors to quickly tailor the antibiotics to only what is needed; this reduces unnecessary antibiotic use and helps reduce ''antibiotic resistance''. It also may reduce side effects and costs of unnecessary antibiotics. These tests cannot be used alone for the diagnosis of a MRSA infection. They do not provide important details about the antibiotics to which the specific strain is susceptible.' "
What types of doctors treat MRSA infections?,"'Since MRSA can affect any organ, different doctors may be involved in caring for someone with MRSA. Most surgeons and primary care doctors, such as family practice specialists, pediatricians, internists, and emergency care doctors, can treat MRSA infections. Complicated or deep MRSA infections are often treated by an infectious diseases specialist who is consulted by another doctor. A ''pulmonologist'' (lung specialist) may help to treat patients with MRSA pneumonia. A cardiologist (heart specialist) may help to diagnose MRSA infection of the heart valves. Specialist surgeons may be needed to treat deep MRSA infections in different parts of the body, such as an orthopedist (bone surgeon), podiatrist (foot surgeon), vascular (blood vessel surgeon), or cardiovascular (heart) surgeons.' "
How should caregivers treat MRSA patients at home?,"'The CDC states that healthy caregivers are unlikely to become infected while caring for MRSA patients at home. Patients with MRSA and their caregivers should do the following:' Clean hands often, especially before and after changing wound dressings or bandages. Keep any wounds clean and change bandages as instructed until healed. Avoid sharing personal items such as towels or razors. Wash and dry clothes and bed linens with detergent and the temperatures recommended on the labels. Cold water is adequate to remove germs if an item cannot be washed warm. Tell health care providers that the person has MRSA. This includes home health nurses and aides, therapists, and personnel in doctors' offices. Follow all other instructions given by the doctor."
What is the treatment for a MRSA infection?,"'Fortunately, many MRSA infections can be treated by a common and long-standing antibiotic, ''vancomycin'' (''Vancocin'' and generic brands), and it is included in most empiric treatment regimens. Newer ''drugs'' are also available, although some are much more expensive: ceftaroline (Teflaro), ''linezolid'' (Zyvox), daptomycin (''Cubicin''), dalbavancin (Dalvance), telavancin (Vibativ), and others. Only linezolid comes in a pill in addition to intravenous (IV) solution. Moderate to severe infections need to be treated by IV antibiotics, usually given in the hospital setting and completed at home with a home health agency.''Less serious infections are often susceptible to ''trimethoprim''-''sulfamethoxazole'' (''Bactrim''), ''doxycycline'' (''Vibramycin''), and ''clindamycin'' (''Cleocin''), all of which come in an oral form as well as IV. Rarely, some strains have become resistant to vancomycin (vancomycin-resistance, vancomycin-resistant ''Staph aureus'', VRSA); this may require combinations of antibiotics.'   The main treatment for boils and abscesses is incision and drainage. Antibiotics may not be needed if the infection is mild and the pus is drained. If antibiotic treatment is needed, it is usually empiric (based on the physician's best guess). Treatment can be made more precise if a pus sample can be sent to the laboratory. When the tests are run to determine that the staph bacteria isolated from a given patient are methicillin-resistant, they also provide valuable information about which antibiotics can successfully kill the bacteria (its susceptibility profile)."
What is the treatment for a MRSA infection? (Continued),"'The CDC recommends clinicians use the 2011 guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) that detail treatments. The 38-page set of guidelines can be found at http://www.idsociety.org/''uploadedFiles/IDSA/Guidelines-Patient_Care/PDF_Library/MRSA.pdf. Since MRSA is resistant to multiple antibiotics, the treatment will depend on the specific MRSA bacteria that is cultured from each patient. The doctor will choose antibiotics that the laboratory reports as susceptible on the resistance test they perform on each culture.''Some people think they are ""cured"" after a few antibiotic doses and stop taking the medicine. Others may start forgetting to take it once they don\'t feel sick and get back to normal activity. This is bad because there may be bacteria left that start the infection up again, spread to other parts of the body, and are exposed to low antibiotic doses. Low antibiotic exposures give MRSA time to become resistant to the medicine. If the infection comes back, it may be worse and even harder to treat. In fact, this is how ''S''. aureus'' and other bacteria became ""superbugs."" Anyone treated with antibiotics should take the entire course of the antibiotic as directed by their doctor. Setting up reminders for yourself as soon as you start on treatment helps keep you on track for success.' "
What is the prognosis of a MRSA infection?,"'The prognosis of MRSA infections depends on how severe the infection is, the overall health of the patient, and how well the infection responds to treatment. Mild to moderate skin infections (boils, small abscesses) in patients with otherwise good health almost always have a good prognosis with full recovery if treated appropriately. However, patients with more severe infection and/or additional health problems (for example, ''diabetes'', immunocompromised status, infected ''trauma'' wound), or those who get MRSA while in the hospital for another problem, have a prognosis from good to poor. MRSA pneumonia or sepsis has a death rate of about 20%. In addition, patients who are treated and do well still have a high risk of recurrent infection that may vary from 20%-40%. In addition, treatment with multiple antibiotics has its own risks. Drug reactions can occur. Killing of ""friendly flora"" (normal protective bacteria) in the bowel can lead to other infections such as pseudomembranous ''colitis'' caused by ''Clostridium difficile''.' "
How can people prevent a MRSA infection?,"'The best way to avoid MRSA infection is to avoid making direct contact with skin, clothing, and any items that come in contact with people who have MRSA. Basic precautions against any infections are most practical. Treat and cover (for example, antiseptic cream and a Band-Aid) any skin breaks or wounds. Pay attention to cleanliness. For example, wash hands with soap after toilet use. Soap makes dirt and bacteria slippery, and rubbing under water removes them. ''Alcohol''-containing hand sanitizers are very effective if hands are not obviously dirty and just need a quick sanitizing. Clothes that may have come in contact with MRSA are effectively treated by washing with detergent; cold water is as good as hot. Frequent cleaning of living areas also helps, especially the bathroom and kitchen.''Pregnant'' women should consult with their doctors if they are infected or are carriers of MRSA. In 2007, the first incidence of MRSA in a pet was recorded. MRSA can be transferred between pets and humans. MRSA has been documented in ''dogs'', cats, and horses but may be found in other animals in the future. Care and treatments are similar to those in humans, but a veterinarian should be consulted on all potential cases.''The CDC does not recommend screening everyone for MRSA. However, the CDC does recommend that high-risk patients who are being admitted to the hospital be screened for MRSA and then, if positive for MRSA, follow infection-control guidelines during the hospital stay. One study showed that the number of infections with both HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA dropped from 2005-2008, and authorities speculate that such drops are due to infection-control measures in hospitals and better home care measures.'  "
What are the potential complications of a MRSA infection?,"'Complications from MRSA can occur in almost all organ systems; the following is a listing of some that can result in permanent organ damage or death: endocarditis, kidney or lung infections (pneumonia), necrotizing fasciitis, osteomyelitis, and sepsis (blood poisoning). Early diagnosis and treatment usually result in better outcomes and reduction or elimination of further complications.' "
What is a superbug?,"'The term ''superbug'' is a nonspecific word that is used to describe any organism that is resistant to at least one or more commonly used antibiotics. The most common bacteria described as superbugs are the following:''Emerging superbugs may include multiple drug-resistant ''Clostridium difficile'', VRSA (vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus''), and NDM ''Escherichia coli'' (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase resistant ''E. coli''), and some strains of ''gonorrhea''. In 2013, the CDC set up a superbug site listing 18 different genera and species as ""threats"" due to ''antimicrobial resistance''. They are categorized as urgent, serious, and concerning according to their potential to cause serious health problems; MRSA is ranked as serious. The U.S. National Institutes of Health funds research to develop new diagnosis tools, treatments, and ''vaccines'' against superbugs, including MRSA.' MRSA (Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to multiple antibiotics) VRE (Enterococcus species resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin) PRSP (Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to penicillin) ESBL (Escherichia coli and similar bacteria that are resistant to a certain category of antibiotics, such as cephalosporins) CRE (Escherichia coli and similar bacteria that are resistant to the carbapenem antibiotics, which are often used as a last resort for ESBL and other resistant bacteria)"

What does multiple sclerosis (MS) look like (pictures)?,"'Multiple sclerosis is a disease that involves an immune-mediated process that results in an abnormal response in the body\'s immune system that damages central nervous system (CNS) tissues in which the immune system attacks myelin, the substance that surrounds and insulate nerves fibers causing demyelination that leads to nerve damage. Because the exact antigen or target of the immune – mediated attack is not known, many experts prefer to label multiple sclerosis as ""immune-mediated instead of an autoimmune disease.""' "
What is multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"""Multiple sclerosis is a disease that causes demyelination of the brain and spinal cord nerve cells. When this occurs, axons (the parts of the nerve cells that conduct impulses to other cells), don't work as well. Myelin acts like insulation on electrical wires. As more areas or nerves are affected by this loss of myelin, patients develop symptoms because the ability of axons to conduct impulses is diminished or lost. The specific symptom that someone experiences is related to the area that has been affected. As demyelination takes place, areas of inflammation and subsequent injury can be identified; these areas of injury are called lesions or plaques and are readily apparent on ""'magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI) studies.' "
Can children and teenagers develop multiple sclerosis (pediatric MS)?,"'Children and teenagers can have MS (pediatric MS). It is estimated that about 8,000 to 10,000 children and teens up to 18 years old have been diagnosed with pediatric MS. Moreover, an additional 10,000 to 15,000 children and teens have had at least one symptom of the disease.''Almost all children diagnosed with pediatric MS have the relapsing-remitting MS type; however, additional symptoms often not experienced in adults with MS may include ''seizures'' and mental status changes like lethargy.''Children and teens with multiple sclerosis are treated with the same therapies as adults, but they are considered “off label” for treating children, (not an FDA approved use for the drug, but it is/may be effective for some people with the condition). Small studies suggest the IV drug natalizumab (''Tysabri'') is safe to use in children with MS who have not responded to other treatments. Discuss all of your child’s ''MS treatments'' or home therapies with his or her health-care team.' "
What are the early symptoms and signs of multiple sclerosis?,"'Multiple sclerosis symptoms'' are dependent on the area of the destruction of the myelin sheath protecting the nerves (demyelination).''Early signs and symptoms are vision problems like ''double vision'' or ''vision loss''.''Other symptoms and signs may include:'   Visual changes, including loss of vision if the optic nerve has been affected Double vision A sensation or feeling of numbness, tingling, or weakness.

As the condition progresses, some people are left with muscle spasticity, or an involuntary painful contraction of certain muscles."
What causes multiple sclerosis?,"""While multiple sclerosis is considered an autoimmune disorder, the exact cause hasn't yet been found. There are many theories regarding the reason that people develop MS. These theories range from ""'vitamin D deficiency'"" to a viral infection. Even consuming too much salt is being looked at as possible causes. However, none of these theories has been proven, and the cause of MS remains unknown. It's not ""'contagious'"", and can't be passed from person to person.""  "
Is multiple sclerosis hereditary? What is the life expectancy?,"'Genetic factors'"" don't seem to play a large role in the disease. Although people who have a first-degree relative with MS have a slightly higher risk of developing it themselves, this risk is felt to be modest.""'People who live in northern latitudes'' (especially Northern European countries) were previously identified as having a higher incidence of the MS. However, over the last 30 years, more cases of MS are now being diagnosed in more temperate regions such as Latin America. Moreover, living in an area until approximately age 15 seems to give someone the relative risk of developing MS for that area. People younger than 15 who move assume the risk of the new location.''Lifestyle factors are not risk factors'' for developing MS, for example, ''diet'', ''exercise'', tobacco use, unlike conditions in which these risk factors are very important, such as ''stroke'', ''heart disease'', or ''diabetes''.' "
How common is multiple sclerosis? Who develops the disease?," Multiple sclerosis occurs predominantly in younger persons, with those aged 15 to 60 most likely to be diagnosed. The average age of diagnosis is about 30 years; however, multiple sclerosis has been identified at all ages. While multiple sclerosis can occur in children, this is very rare. About 2.5 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with MS; of those, about 400,000 live in the United States. Women are about twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis."
What are the four types of multiple sclerosis?,"'There are four types of multiple sclerosis.''Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most common form of MS.''People with this form of the disease develop symptoms that respond to treatment and then resolve. The development of symptoms is often referred to as an exacerbation of the disease. Episodes of remission may last for weeks to years.'""Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) is diagnosed when the problems caused by an exacerbation don't fully resolve during a remission. This often occurs in patients who were initially diagnosed with RRMS. Over time, patients are identified with progressive debility.""'Primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) progresses over time, without episodes of remission or improvement of symptoms.''Progressive-relapsing multiple sclerosis (PRMS) is identified when patients experience escalating symptoms over time, as well as intermittent episodes of remission.'  "
What procedures and tests diagnose MS?,"'Patient history important because many people with multiple sclerosis have experienced various symptoms, which were ignored or attributed to other events or illnesses. If a person recalls no prior symptoms, the remaining medical history is needed to exclude other conditions that might mimic multiple sclerosis.''Once the history is obtained, a complete physical examination is required. Doctors look for signs of injury to the central nervous system (either the brain or spinal cord); findings on the examination can help a doctor determine which area of the central nervous system (CNS) is involved.''Imaging studies help to confirm a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The most common test done is a magnetic resonance image, or MRI. ''CT scans'', while helpful in finding some brain injuries, are unable to reveal the changes associated with multiple sclerosis with as much detail as an MRI. ''MRIs'' can be used to image the brain and the spinal cord.''A ''spinal tap'', or lumbar puncture, is done to collect a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid. Testing can be done on this fluid to confirm the presence of protein, inflammatory markers, and other substances. With the routine use of MRI, performing a spinal tap is not considered mandatory, unless there are questionable findings on the MRI or other questions to answer.''Evoked potential testing (visual evoked potentials, brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and somatosensory evoked potentials) can show slowed response times in the optic nerve, the auditory nerve, the spinal cord, or the brainstem. While helpful, these tests are not specific for changes seen in multiple sclerosis.''When multiple sclerosis is suspected, blood work and testing to exclude other conditions, such as ''Lyme disease'', ''vasculitis'', ''lupus'', ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV''), and processes which lead to multiple ''strokes'', are often done as well.'  "
How is multiple sclerosis treated?,"'Many factors go into consideration for the treatment of a patient who has multiple sclerosis. During an acute exacerbation, steroids given through an IV are commonly prescribed, and often help patients recover more rapidly. If a patient cannot receive steroids, plasma exchange can be used.''Steroids given through an IV are commonly used to treat acute exacerbation of the disease, and often help people recover more quickly. If an individual cannot receive steroids, plasma exchange can be used.''Once a diagnosis has been confirmed, disease-modifying therapy is often recommended. This therapy may decrease the number of exacerbations that a patient experiences or decrease the severity of an exacerbation. In addition, many of these therapies have been shown to decrease the potential for developing long-term disability.'

It is not yet known what the long-term outcome of patients who begin treatment at an early stage of their disease will be.''There are two extremes in multiple sclerosis. The first is a ""benign"" syndrome in which patients have numerous lesions identified on MRI imaging, but have few -- if any -- symptoms, even decades after their diagnosis. At the opposite end of the spectrum is a condition identified as the Marburg variant of multiple sclerosis, where rapidly progressive symptoms are seen and death may occur after a very short time.'  "
Can you prevent multiple sclerosis?,"'Without a clearly defined cause of multiple sclerosis, ways to prevent this disease have not yet been identified. Exercising regularly, getting sufficient ''sleep'', or eating healthy meals will be of long-term benefit for many people, but have not been shown to be of help to prevent the development of multiple sclerosis.' "
Which types of doctors and specialists treat multiple sclerosis?,"'Speech pathologist:'' A speech pathologist can help patients improve speech clarity, and some can even work on cognitive exercises for patients who have problems with memory. If ''swallowing problems'' are identified, speech pathologists can help determine the cause and whether therapy will help improve swallowing ability or if dietary changes are needed.''Primary care provider: ''A primary care provider such as a family doctor or internist is needed to help keep patients with MS in good health by keeping track of ''blood pressure'', ''cholesterol'', glucose, immunization status, and other factors.''Radiologist:'' A radiologist reads the imaging studies obtained to monitor the status of patients with MS by comparing current studies to prior studies, doctors can determine if the disease has stabilized.''Physical therapist:'' Physical therapists work to help patients regain mobility or strength. They also help patients determine how maintain their strength and mobility after a chronic disease is diagnosed.''Occupational therapist: ''Occupational therapists often work closely with physical therapists to help with mobility issues due to MS. Moreover, these therapists also teach people with MS how to adjust or modify things in their surroundings and homes by using tools or actions to safely perform daily activities.''Clinical psychologist:'' A clinical psychologist can help patients with MS who are experiencing ''depression'', ''anxiety'', or who need help in coping with their diagnosis. Psychologists provide counseling or ''psychotherapy''; they do not prescribe medications. On occasion, they work closely with psychiatrists who determine if medications are needed, and if so, which medications to prescribe.''Neurologist'':'' A neurologist is a doctor who has specialized training in diseases of the brain and nervous system. Some neurologists have additional training in treating multiple sclerosis.' "
What research is being done on multiple sclerosis?,"'Many areas related to the diagnosis and treatments of multiple sclerosis are being explored. These include more in-depth analysis of genetic factors, including factors, which may help with the diagnosis and prediction of patient response to treatment options. ''Drugs'"" that show promise in eliminating or preventing new multiple sclerosis lesions from forming are being evaluated. These new MS medications include drugs in pill form and by injection. A good animal model of multiple sclerosis has not been yet developed. Researchers think that a working animal model would help with the development of medications to treat multiple sclerosis. Stem cell therapy, which may help reboot a patient's immune system so that multiple sclerosis lesions no longer form, is being evaluated more closely."" "
What is multiple sclerosis (MS)?," Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks myelinated axons in the brain and spinal cord nerve fibers (central nervous system), damaging or destroying the myelin (demyelination) and/or the axons (nerve tissue). Sclerosis means abnormal hardening or thickening of tissue, often due to inflammation. Myelin is a fatty substance that covers, surrounds, and protects the nerves. Think of myelin as a conduit in an electrical system that ensures messages sent by axons (nerve fibers) are not lost en route. MS often progresses slowly over many years (about 25 years). Multiple sclerosis is most commonly diagnosed in females ages 20 to 40 but may occur at any age and both genders. Usually, multiple sclerosis in children and teens (pediatric MS) goes undiagnosed; however, medical professionals have diagnosed about 8,000 to 10,000 children and teens in the United States with the disease. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis in children, teens, and adults may have common symptoms or similar first symptoms, for example:WeaknessFatigueTinglingBlurred visionPain Weakness Fatigue Tingling Blurred vision Pain Other symptoms and signs of MS in children and teens include seizures and/or mental status changes like lethargy. People with MS often suffer intermittent attacks followed by periods of symptom remissions. Due to the intermittent nature and variety of symptoms, MS can often be a challenging diagnosis for health care providers. MS attacks can last for days or months at a time followed by remissions; some individuals however, may continue to get worse without periods of remission."
At what age does multiple sclerosis start?,"'The early signs and early ''symptoms of multiple sclerosis'' usually begin between the ages of 20 and 40 years old. However, it is possible to have MS begin in childhood (termed pediatric MS, which includes infancy to 18) or over 40 years of age, but it occurs less frequently in these age groups. Only about 2%-5% of all people diagnosed with MS (MS patients or MSers) have symptoms before age 18. ''Multiple sclerosis'' in children and teens is difficult to diagnose, so its true frequency of occurrence is only estimated. In some MS patients, there is evidence that infection with the ''Epstein-Barr virus'' may help trigger MS disease.' "
Does multiple sclerosis cause pain?,"'About two-thirds of people with MS report ''pain'' as a symptom of their disease. The most common types of ''pain'' experienced by people with MS are ''headache'', ''back pain'', extremity ''pain'', and ''muscle spasms''. Because the pain comes from the nerves, common pain medicines like ''aspirin'' have little or no effect; however, other medications may be effective. Lhermitte\'s sign is sometimes experienced by MS patients; it\'s a sharp ""electrical"" sensation that occurs in the back and into the limbs and/or runs up and down the spine (spinal cord) when the head is bent forward.' "
5 early signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis,"'Because the autoimmune inflammatory response may attack some of the myelinated axons in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) almost anywhere, the location (and severity) of each attack can be different. Consequently, the symptoms of an MS attack may be quite variable from patient to patient and can appear almost anywhere in the body. The usual first sign and symptom is often a change in sensory perception (paresthesias) almost anywhere in the body. Other early common symptoms include the following:''Because of the highly variable symptoms, this is a disease that is difficult to diagnose when symptoms first appear. The rest of the article will present symptoms that arise from various parts of the body that can be due to MS. Unfortunately, many of the symptoms described can occur in other disease processes so it is important to have a diagnosis of MS in part by ruling out other conditions.''The diagnosis of MS usually involves a ''neurologist'' who will take your medical history, do blood tests, tests to measure electrical activity in the brain and other areas, an ''MRI'', and an analysis of spinal cord fluid. Tests may be done to distinguish MS from ''stroke'', thyroid-caused illness, or other debilitating diseases that cause similar symptoms to MS.'

"Numbness, tingling, and pain","'As previously mentioned, individuals with MS have variable symptoms so symptoms described above are generalized symptoms. It is likely that a person with ''multiple sclerosis'' may show initial symptoms in one or two of these major categories in the early development of MS; other symptoms may or may not appear later in the disease process. However, MS is a slowly progressive disease for which there is no known cure. The goal of treatment is to reduce and/or control symptoms and prevent relapse.'

What are the treatment guidelines for MS symptoms?,'Multiple sclerosis'' is a slowly progressive disease for which there is no known cure. The goal of treatment is to reduce and/or control symptoms and prevent relapses. Treatment of multiple sclerosis has two major areas that are used to reduce and/or control symptoms and prevent relapses. The first area for controlling symptoms is to treat the underlying immune system disorder of MS; the second area is designed to reduce and/or treat ''MS symptoms'' and relapses. Primary caregivers usually seek medical advice from neurologists for treatment protocols.' 
List of first line drugs to treat MS symptoms,"'Although the underlying or triggering mechanism for MS and for MS relapses is unknown, several ''drugs'' have been shown to have beneficial effects in people with ''MS symptoms'' including reducing the frequency and severity of clinical MS attacks. These ''drugs'' act on the immune system by modulating its response, and such agents have been approved for use for treatment. These agents include''These drugs often have side effects and are usually prescribed by physicians experienced in treating people with MS. Plasmapheresis (a method to remove autoantibodies from the blood) is another technique used to reduce the autoimmune problems in certain people with MS.''The FDA recently approved the drug ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) to treat adult patients medically who have relapsing-remitting MS and for MS type, primary progressive MS (PPMS). This is the first drug the FDA approved for PPMS and is administered by intravenous infusion. Although not yet approved by the FDA, stem cell treatments for MS are available and may reduce symptoms in some patients; the treatment does not claim to cure MS.''Multiple sclerosis in children and teens is treated based on best treatment protocol for the specific child.'   interferons (beta-1 a and beta-1 b; injection, solution, kit); glatiramer acetate (Copaxone); natalizumab (Tysabri): an IV medication that slows the progression of symptoms and decreases the number of flare-ups; mitoxantrone; fingolimod (Gilenya); teriflunomide (Aubagio); dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera); rebidose; methylprednisolone and other IV steroids; and IV immunoglobulin."

Generally, cladribine is used in people with MS who have tried other multiple sclerosis medications that were not tolerated well or ineffective. People with clinically isolated syndrome not take cladribine.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat multiple sclerosis?,"'A neurologist administers the primary treatment of patients with MS. Additional consultation with specialists is often recommended; for example, individuals with cognitive problems may be helped by a neuropsychologist and/or a psychiatrist while those with symptoms related to the bowel or bladder may be best served by consultation with a ''gastroenterologist'' or ''urologist''. Individuals with advanced MS with multiple problems may require (in addition to physician specialists who manage disease-modifying medications) a social worker specialist to manage the intense every day care required for a person with multiple MS symptoms. Some patients with debilitating ''multiple sclerosis symptoms'' and poor health may require a live-in ''caregiver''.''Treatment for multiple sclerosis in children and teens is by pediatric specialists with experience in pediatric MS.''For additional information about MS, contact the Multiple Sclerosis Society and/or the MS International Federation.'

What is of multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"'Multiple sclerosis'' (''MS'') is a disease that causes ''demyelination'"" of the brain and spinal cord, or a loss of the covering around axons. When this occurs, the axons (the parts of the nerve cells that transmit impulses to other cells) don't work well. As more areas of the central nervous system are affected by the loss of myelin, different symptoms develop. "" "
What are the symptoms of MS?,"'The ''specific symptom seen in ''MS'' is related to the area of injury in the brain or spinal cord. Examples of symptoms of MS include: '   a numbness, burning ors tingling feeling, or weakness in certain areas of

What alternative treatments can be used for MS symptoms?,"'Fatigue'' and spasticity seem to respond best to CAM. ''Therapies that have been shown to be of some benefit for fatigue have included:''Spasticity has reportedly been reduced with the use of acupuncture and massage therapy. A sense of tingling (paresthesias) have been reportedly improved with reflexology.''Symptoms including ''depression'', memory loss, ''urinary incontinence'', and progression of MS itself (including relapses, disease extent as measured on ''MRI''), and disability have had limited improvement when treated with CAM.

What about medical marijuana (cannabis) for MS symptoms?,"'There have been a number of studies looking at the potential benefits of medical marijuana (cannabis) on MS symptoms, including spasticity and ''chronic pain''. There is some suggestion that FDA approved forms of medical cannabis (Marinol or Sativex) may be beneficial in improving spasticity or bladder frequency. However, there are no reports that ingested or inhaled medical marijuana is beneficial for conditions associated with MS. The''National Multiple Sclerosis Society'' has more information about medical marijuana for ''MS symptoms'' (http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines/Marijuana)' "
Who is eligible to pursue treatment with CAM?,"'Anyone can participate CAM therapy. However, it is important to recognize that most of these therapies are not covered by insurance, and may be an ""out of pocket"" cost for patients with MS.''Patients who decide to pursue CAM need to share this information with their physicians, as some supplements may interact with convention medication and lead to side effects.' "
How much does CAM cost?,"'The costs of CAM can vary widely; regular exercise and yoga can be low or no-cost options, while massage therapy, acupuncture, and some supplements can be quite expensive. Every patient must have a good relationship with treating health-care professionals of traditional and non-traditional therapies to best understand potential costs.' "
What are the potential risks and side effects of CAM?,"'Side effects of CAM vary depending on the treatment.''It is important to discuss any potential or ongoing use of CAM with your health-care professional, who may need to adjust your current therapies to prevent any adverse effects caused by interactions between the two types of therapies.'

What is multiple sclerosis (MS)?,'Multiple sclerosis'' (''MS'') is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) that causes ''demyelination'' (destruction of myelin that insulates and protects the nerve cells) of the brain and spinal cord nerve cells. The cause of ''multiple sclerosis'' is not known.'  
"Who gets multiple sclerosis, and how many people have it?","'Onset of the disease occurs in younger people ages 15 to 30 but can be diagnosed in older and younger persons (rarely in a child). The incidence is about 400,000 patients in the US, with a ratio of 2 to 1 females to males.''Multiple sclerosis'' is not considered to be a fatal disease although rarely it may be fatal due to complications.''The lifespan in people with this form of sclerosis, especially if it is treated early, is about the same as in the general population.' "
4 Types of MS,"'There are four types of ''multiple sclerosis'':' Relapsing: Remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most common form of MS. Remission may last for weeks to years.There are two subgroups in RRMS, a subgroup termed clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) consisting of a single episode of neurologic symptoms, and subgroup termed benign MS, consisting of MS with almost complete remission between relapses and little if any accumulation of physical disability over time. There are two subgroups in RRMS, a subgroup termed clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) consisting of a single episode of neurologic symptoms, and subgroup termed benign MS, consisting of MS with almost complete remission between relapses and little if any accumulation of physical disability over time. Secondary: In progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) exacerbations don’t fully resolve during remission. Primary: Progressive primary multiple sclerosis (PPMS) progresses over time without episodes of remission. Progressive: In relapsing multiple sclerosis (PRMS) patients experience increasing symptoms over time and intermittent episodes of remission."
What are the signs and symptoms of MS?,"'Signs and ''symptoms of multiple sclerosis'' are variable and depend on the area of the destruction of the myelin protecting brain and spinal cord nerves. Consequently, people with the disease may have some symptoms that other people may not have. In general, however, early signs and symptoms include visual problems such as ''double vision'' and/or ''vision loss''. Other symptoms that may occur, depending upon the patient’s disease process, include:'  Numbness Tingling (paresthesias) Weakness Vision changes Paralysis Vertigo (the person is susceptible to the risk of falls) Lack of coordination of limbs (disability to function normally, for example, the person has difficulty walking) Muscle spasms and/or involuntary muscle contractions that are painful Urinary incontinence Sexual dysfunction Heat intolerance Slurred speech Sharp, electrical like pain that occurs in the spine with neck flexion (Lhermitte sign) Mental status changes"
"Can you get MS from people who have it, and can it passed on to children?","'There is no evidence that multiple sclerosis undergoes transmission person-to-person. Consequently, the disease is not considered to be ''contagious'' so other people cannot catch it from any person with ''MS'' they may come in contact with. It is not considered hereditary by many researchers; however, individuals that have a first degree relative (for example, a parent or sibling) that develops the disease increases the risk of developing the disease. Some new research suggests that if people inherit a genetic mutation on gene NR1H3, they may develop ''MS'' (rapidly progressive form). These findings are new, and they and other genetic factors are being investigated further.''Although lifestyle factors like ''diet'', ''smoking'', ''exercise'' influence the development of such diseases like ''cancer'' and ''diabetes'', they are not risk factors in developing MS. There is much speculation about risk factors and/or causes for MS, and they range from ''vitamin D deficiency'' to viral infections such as Epstein-Barr infections, association with black ''mold'', and even too much salt intake. None of these theories or speculations have been proven. However, a recent study at Harvard suggested that ''Epstein-Barr virus'' infection may be a trigger to set off MS in genetically susceptible individuals with ''vitamin D'' deficiency.' "
What treatments are available for MS and its symptoms?,"'Treatment of MS is often determined by the type and medical condition of the patient. ''Drugs'', either rejected or taken orally are the main medical treatments, although ''drugs'' don’t cure MS. Drug therapy can limit and/or postpone nerve damage and reduce relapse occurrences.''This is a list of drugs that may be used by your doctors and other health care professionals to treat your type of MS:''Treatment of MS should be discussed with your doctor. Patients are urged to question their doctors or other health care professionals about their type of MS condition, drug treatment, and prognosis.

"How will I know if I have MS, and when should I contact my doctor if I think I may have the condition?","'If you develop any of the symptoms listed previously, you should contact your doctor or other health care professional as soon as possible. Your doctor will perform a physical exam and get a history of your symptoms. If multiple sclerosis is suspected, blood work will probably be ordered to exclude another disease or disorder such as ''Lyme disease'', ''lupus'', or ''HIV''. A ''spinal tap'' may be done along with nerve studies (evoked potential testing). Imaging studies such as a ''MRI'' may be done. Your doctor will likely consult a ''neurologist'' to help make a diagnosis and for additional medical advice about ''multiple sclerosis treatment''.' "
What should you know about factitious disorders (Munchausen syndrome)?,"'Facticious disorder (previously called ""''Munchausen syndrome''"") is characterized by feigning or intentionally producing physical or emotional symptoms in another person in order to place that person in the sick role.''Symptoms a victim of ''factitious disorders'' signs and symptoms vary greatly; however, they may have symptoms that are more easily faked or induced, like suffocation, ''seizure'', bleeding or ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', or ''diarrhea'' that can be the result of poisoning presents with are highly variable,''How often factitious disorders occurs is likely very much underestimated, as evidenced by it often taking years to be discovered, even being completely missed in siblings of the victim that is eventually identified.''Males are victims of factitious disorders as often as females. Women are perpetrators of this disorder the vast majority of the time, theoretically because women remain the primary caretakers of children. Perpetrators of the syndrome are vulnerable to also suffering from ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and some personality disorders.''What causes factitious disorders?''While there is no specific cause for MSBP, perpetrators tend to have trouble forming a healthy attachment to their children, difficulty managing their anger and frustration, as well as having an ability to overcome the more natural tendency for caretakers to protect the children they care for. Perpetrators are also more likely to have a history of either losing a parent or being abused or neglected as a child.''Theories about what perpetrators gain from assuming the sick role through their child include seeking help, inducing symptoms, and being ""addicted"" to interactions with medical professionals.''Factitious disorders usually is diagnosed through intensive communication between medical, mental-health, and child-protection professionals, as well as review of all available medical records and interviewing family members, school personnel, and other pertinent community members. Sometimes, covertly videotaping the suspected abuser when with the child can be a useful additional diagnostic tool.''The treatment of MSBP involves close collaboration with professionals, family, and community members, intensive ''psychotherapy'' for the victim and the perpetrator, as well as protecting the child by either intensive supervision of the perpetrator, temporary or permanent removal of the child from the care of the abuser, and sometimes includes prosecution and incarceration of the perpetrator.'""If left untreated, MSBP can result in the child's death or growing up emotionally and/or medically disabled.""'Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP) is now classified as a somatic symptom and related disorder. It is referred to as factitious disorder that is imposed by one individual on another or factitious disorder by proxy.' "
What is factitious disorder by proxy?,"'Factitious disorders by proxy features a caretaker covertly abusing a child by faking or causing symptoms in the victim. Factitious disorder (previously called ''Munchhausen syndrome'') is a disorder that imposes one person another by proxy induced illness, or fabricated illness, and is a mental disorder that belongs to the group of mental illnesses called somatic symptom and related disorders. It is characterized by a feigning or intentional production of physical or mental-health symptoms in another person for the sole purpose of placing the other person in the sick role. While the reported frequency with which occurs seems low at one to three in 100,000, it is likely that the actual number of undiscovered cases is much higher. International statistics indicate that this condition is being increasingly assessed when it is severe, and as many as 1% of children with ''asthma'' have experienced at least once. Tends to affect males as victims as often as females. Affected individuals are usually 4 years old or younger and mothers are typically the perpetrators most of the time. The tendency toward maternal perpetrators may be more a result of women continuing to be the primary ''caregiver'' role than any gender-based predisposition to the disorder. Can take two years or more from the beginning or onset of symptoms to when it is diagnosed. Victims of are ominously found to have a sibling who is either deceased or to have had medical problems similar to the current victim of the disorder.''This disorder was named for Baron Karl Friedrich von Munchausen. He lived from 1720-1797, was born in Germany, joined the Russian military, and was known to tell fantastic tales about the battles he participated in against the Ottoman Turks. For example, he apparently told stories about riding cannonballs and traveling to the moon. As opposed to (factitious disorder imposed on another person), factitious disorder imposed on self is a ''mental illness'' in which what are initially thought to be symptoms of illness in the sufferer are in reality a fabrication of the illness by the sufferer rather than fabrication of illness by a third person. The motivation for factitious disorder imposed on self also tends to be an attempt by the sufferer to be seen as sick (assuming the sick or patient role). Emotional problems that tend to co-occur in people with include ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and some personality disorders like ''borderline personality disorder'' and sociopathy.'  "
What are factitious disorders by proxy symptoms and signs?,"'In the diagnostic manual that is recognized by most mental-health professionals, ''The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'', MSBP is classified as a somatic symptom and related disorder and is referred to as factitious disorder that is imposed by one individual on another.''Symptoms of factitious disorders include the sufferer being induced to experience physical or psychological symptoms or to have symptoms fabricated by another person, usually a caretaker. Specific symptoms in the victim are nearly as varied as the number of victims and perpetrators, with perhaps more emphasis on symptoms that are more feasibly manufactured or induced or are more difficult to measure objectively through laboratory tests (for example, stomach upset, other body aches and pains, and trouble ''breathing'' or sleeping).''Other more common symptoms presented by victims of factitious disorders include suffocation, induced ''seizures'', bleeding, or poisoning that presents as ''vomiting'' or ''diarrhea''. The abusive parent may describe symptoms in their child that do not exist. The symptoms may get worse only when the suspected caretaker is present or recently visited and may improve when the perpetrator is absent. Theories on what motivates the adult who assumes the sick role by causing a child to be sick might fall into one of three categories of motivation: help seeking, active induction of symptoms, and ""''addiction''"" to interactions with doctors. The help seeker is thought to be motivated to fabricate or cause their child\'s symptoms as a way of getting help for him or herself, assuming the sick role through their association with the supposedly sick child. This may be due to their feeling overwhelmed by their adult relationship, parenthood, or their own physical or emotional problems. The parent who actively induces symptoms of factitious disorders in the victim is thought to be seeking control of the medical professionals, as well as wanting recognition as an excellent parent by the professionals. Perpetrators who seem to be addicted to doctors are thought to be motivated to be seen as knowing better than the doctors.'  "
What causes factitious disorders by proxy? ,"'Although there is no specific cause for factitious disorders, like most other mental disorders, it is understood to be the result of a combination of biological vulnerabilities, ways of thinking, and social stressors (biopsychosocial model). Little is known about the specific biological vulnerabilities of individuals with factitious disorders. Psychologically, factitious disorders perpetrators tend to have trouble forming a healthy bond (attachment) with their children. Personality traits of individuals who have a history of inducing symptoms in the children they care for include trouble managing anger or frustration. Socially, those who feign or induce symptoms in others tend to have suffered from some sort of major negative event (''trauma'') during their own upbringing, including the death of a parent or other caretaker or having been themselves the victim of ''child abuse'' or neglect.' "
What are the treatment guidelines for factitious disorders?,"'As factitious disorders involves the caretaker covertly abusing a child by faking or causing symptoms in the child victim, a pediatrician who has experience and training in assessing and treating child abuse is often consulted and may be the primary professional working with the family. That professional will usually work with other professionals to review all medical records that have been kept and to communicate regularly about parents who are thought to seek excessive care since the abusive parent involved may have visited many different practitioners, even using different names in some cases, in an attempt to avoid the scrutiny that is likely harder to avoid if working with one medical practice, since one practitioner has more of an opportunity to get to know the perpetrator and the victim of factitious disorders over time. Covertly videotaping the interactions of a child with the suspected caretaker/abuser can be useful even when the victim is in a highly monitored setting like an intensive-care unit. While videotaping the child in the hospital may help in confirming or refuting the suspicion that the parent is engaged in harming the child, it is appropriately not seen as a substitute for the hard work of close monitoring, collaboration between all medical professionals, child protective services, mental-health professionals, and community members (for example, teachers, school counselors, clergy, and concerned extended family members) involved.'""As with other mental-health issues, there is no specific definitive test, such as a blood test, that can accurately assess that a person has factitious disorders . Therefore, practitioners conduct a mental-health interview that looks for the presence of the symptoms previously described. As with any mental-health assessment, the professional will usually work toward ruling out other mental and physical disorders and ensuring that the individual is not suffering from a primary medical problem or from medical issues that may have symptoms that cause emotional symptoms. He or she will therefore often inquire about when the child has most recently had a physical examination, comprehensive blood work, and any other tests that a medical professional deems necessary to ensure that he or she is not suffering from a true medical condition instead of or in addition to a caretaker potentially manufacturing symptoms in the child. Also of significant importance is the practitioner reviewing any available previous medical records and talking to other people who may be in the child's life (such as the other parent, if available, teachers, and counselors) in order to explore the possibility of a pattern of the caretaker in question making illness up before in this child or in a sibling or other child in their care.""'Due to the use of a mental-health interview in making the diagnosis, the potentially dire consequences to missing the diagnosis of factitious disorders or falsely assigning the diagnosis, as well as the fact that this disorder can be quite resistant to treatment, it is of great importance that the practitioner know to conduct a thorough assessment. It is equally important that the medical and mental-health professionals work together very closely and do not make assumptions about how much medical knowledge a parent should have or how they should behave in a situation involving the illness of their child. As only 50% of people with factitious disorders ever come to the attention of a psychiatrist, the importance of vigilant assessment and insisting on treatment when possible seems all the more important.' "
What is the treatment for factitious disorders by proxy?,"""The involvement of a comprehensive child-protective-services team is of paramount importance in the treatment of factitious disorders. As with any other child abuse, achieving and maintaining the safety of the child in the least restrictive setting is a key focus. If professionals, family members other than the perpetrator, and community support systems can successfully maintain the safety of the victim and any other child in the home, refraining from removing children from the home may be encouraged. However, if keeping the child in the same home is thought to put him or her at continued risk of harm, steps will likely be taken to move the victim and/or other children to a safer placement. With effective treatment progress by the victim and the abuser, professionals may consider slowly reintroducing the child to the home while closely monitoring the child's safety. In the event that such reintegration is not possible, the child might be permanently placed outside the home of the perpetrator. In severe cases, professionals may seek the prosecution and incarceration of the perpetrator and permanently prevent the abuser's access to the victim.""'In working with the child, therapists often teach the victim techniques for changing dysfunctional ways of behaving while helping the child understand the underlying feelings and motivations for those behaviors. While psychiatric medications like ''antidepressant'', anti-anxiety, mood stabilizer, and antipsychotic medications may be used to alleviate specific symptoms for the perpetrator or victim, medication by no means cures the illness completely.'""Individual psychotherapy for both the perpetrator of factitious disorders and the victim, as well as family therapy for members of the household involved are often incorporated into the treatment program. At the same time, the ongoing use of medical services is closely monitored by medical, mental-health, and child-protection professionals. Sometimes, the primary-care doctor (for example, pediatrician) will be notified by the insurance company of future use of medical services by the factitious disorders victim or the victim's siblings. The professional might also be notified when the child is absent from school. Access to such information is either granted through child protective services or by a parent. School officials may agree not to excuse an absence unless approved by the primary-care physician."" "
What if factitious disorders aren't treated? ,"'If left untreated, the prognosis of factitious disorders can be quite ominous. It can result in child victims who grow up to be medically, emotionally, or otherwise functionally disabled adults. Research shows that people who were the victim of MSBP as children are more likely to develop weight problems (including ''anorexia'' or ''obesity'') and ''chronic pain'' as adults. Emotional complications can include ''depression'', anxiety, anger problems, ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), and ''mood swings''. People with this disorder are prone to having trouble completing their education and either avoiding or excessively visiting medical practitioners. It can even be fatal in more than 5% of cases, and more than 7% may have long-term or permanent injury as a result. Survivors of this disorder are sadly at higher risk of becoming perpetrators of this and other forms of child abuse as adults.' "
Is it possible to prevent factitious disorders by proxy?,"'Prevention'' strategies for factitious disorders currently tend to focus on avoiding continued abuse once factitious disorders is identified. Given the low frequency with which this disorder is diagnosed, some researchers propose that studies of this disorder would be better focused on its early identification and treatment rather than on prevention.'

What is the pancreas?,"'The pancreas is an organ approximately six inches long that is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and in front of the spine and ''aorta''. The pancreas is divided into three regions: the head, the body, and the tail. The head of the pancreas is located on the right side of the abdomen adjacent to the duodenum. The tail is on the left side of the abdomen, and the body lies between the head and the tail.''There are two functional parts to the pancreas, referred to as the exocrine and endocrine parts. The majority of the cells of the pancreas produce digestive juices which contain the enzymes necessary for digesting food in the intestine. The enzymes are secreted into smaller collecting ducts within the pancreas (side branches). The side branches empty into a larger duct, the main pancreatic duct, which empties into the intestine through the papilla of Vater in the duodenum. During passage through the ducts, bicarbonate is added to the ''digestive enzymes'' to make the pancreatic secretion alkaline. The cells and ducts producing the digestive juices comprise the exocrine part of the pancreas.''Just before the main pancreatic duct enters the duodenum, it usually merges with the common bile duct that collects bile (a fluid that helps to digest fat) produced by the ''liver''. The common bile duct usually joins the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas. The union of these two ducts forms the ampulla of Vater which drains both the bile and pancreatic fluid into the duodenum through the papilla of Vater.''Buried within the tissue of the pancreas, primarily in the head, are small collections of cells, termed the Islets of Langerhans. The cells of the Islets produce several hormones, for example, ''insulin'', glucagon, and somatostatin; that are released into the blood (the islets do not connect with the pancreatic ducts) and travel in the blood to other parts of the body. These hormones have effects throughout the body, for example, insulin, which helps to regulate blood ''sugar'' levels. The hormone-secreting portion of the pancreas -- the Islets -- is the endocrine part of the pancreas.' "
What are pancreatic cysts?,"'Pancreatic ''cysts'' are collections (pools) of fluid that can form within the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. Some pancreatic cysts are true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts), that is, they are lined by a special layer of cells that are responsible for secreting fluid into the cysts. Other cysts are pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and do not contain specialized lining cells. Often these pseudocysts contain pancreatic digestive juices because they are connected to the pancreatic ducts. Pancreatic cysts can range in size from several millimeters to several centimeters. Many pancreatic cysts are small and benign and produce no symptoms, but some cysts become large and cause symptoms, and others are cancerous or ''precancerous''. (Precancerous cysts are benign cysts that have the potential to become cancerous.)''Different types of cysts contain different types of fluids. For example, pseudocysts that form after an attack of ''acute pancreatitis'' contain digestive enzymes, such as amylase, in high concentrations. Mucinous cysts contain ''mucus'' (a proteinaceous liquid) produced by the mucinous cells that form the inside lining of the ''cyst''.' "
What are the symptoms of pancreatic cysts?,"   The symptoms of pancreatic cysts depend on their size and location. Small (less than two cm) cysts usually cause no symptoms. Large pancreatic cysts can cause
	abdominal pain and 
	back pain presumably by exerting pressure on the surrounding tissues and nerves. 
	 Small or large cysts in the head of the pancreas also may cause
	jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes with 
	darkening of 
	the urine) due to obstruction of the common bile duct. (Obstruction causes bile to back up and forces bilirubin--the chemical that produces jaundice--back into the bloodstream 
	and forces it to be excreted in the urine.) 
	 If the cysts become infected, it may result in
	fever, 
	chills, and 
	sepsis.  
	 On rare occasions, large pseudocysts can compress the stomach or the duodenum leading to obstruction  
	to the movement of food in the intestines, resulting in abdominal pain and
	vomiting. 
	 If a cyst becomes malignant and begins to invade the surrounding tissues, it may lead to the same type of pain as 
	pancreatic cancer, pain that usually is constant and felt in the back and upper abdomen.

"What are the causes of 
pancreatic cysts?","'There are two major types of pancreatic cysts; pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts). Inflammatory cysts are benign, whereas non-inflammatory cysts can be benign, precancerous, or cancerous.'  "
Pseudocysts,"'Most of the inflammatory cysts of the pancreas are pancreatic pseudocysts. Pseudocysts of the pancreas result from ''pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas). The common causes of pancreatitis include ''alcoholism'', ''gallstones'', ''trauma'', and surgery. The fluid inside the pseudocysts represents liquefied dead pancreatic tissue, cells of inflammation, and a high concentration of digestive enzymes  that are present in pancreatic exocrine secretions. (Most pseudocysts have connections with the pancreatic ducts.) Most pseudocysts caused by acute pancreatitis resolve spontaneously (without treatment) within several weeks. Pseudocysts that need treatment are those that persist beyond six weeks and are causing symptoms such as pain, obstruction of the stomach or duodenum, or have become infected. ' "
True cysts," Serous cyst adenomas: These cysts are mostly benign and commonly occur in middle-aged women. They usually are located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Typically, they are small and cause no symptoms although rarely they may cause abdominal pain. Mucinous cyst adenomas: Thirty percent of these cysts contain cancer, and those that do not contain cancer are considered precancerous. They also commonly occur in middle-aged women and are usually located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): These cysts have a high likelihood of being or becoming cancerous. At the time of diagnosis, there is a 45% to 65% chance of the cyst already being cancerous. These cysts are more common in middle-aged men and are more commonly located in the head of the pancreas. The cysts typically produce large amounts of mucous which sometimes can be seen draining out of the papilla of Vater at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), a test that visualizes the ampulla of Vater and the pancreatic duct. These cysts can cause abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. Increased risk for cancer occurs with older age of the patient, presence of symptoms, involvement of the main pancreatic duct, dilation of the main pancreatic duct over 10 mm, the presence of nodules in the wall of the duodenum, and size over 3 cm for side-branch IPMN. Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: These are rare tumors that have both solid and cystic components and are found mainly in young Asian and black women. They may reach a large size and can become malignant. Prognosis is excellent after complete surgical resection of these tumors."
How do medical professionals diagnose pancreatic cysts?,"'Since the majority of pancreatic cysts are small and produce no symptoms, they often are discovered incidentally when abdominal scans (''ultrasound'' [US], ''computerized tomography'' or CT, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' or ''MRI'') are performed to investigate unrelated symptoms. Unfortunately, ultrasound, CT, and MRI cannot reliably distinguish benign cysts (cysts that usually need no treatment) from precancerous and cancerous cysts (cysts that usually require surgical removal).''Endoscopic ultrasound'' (EUS) is becoming increasingly useful in determining whether a pancreatic cyst is likely to be benign, precancerous, or cancerous. During endoscopic ultrasound, an endoscope with a small ultrasound transducer at its tip is inserted into the mouth and is passed through the\xa0''esophagus''\xa0and stomach into the duodenum. From this location, which is very close to the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, accurate and detailed images can be obtained of the liver, pancreas and the gallbladder.''During endoscopic ultrasound, fluid from cysts and samples of tissue also can be obtained by passing special needles through the endoscope and into the cysts. The process of obtaining tissue or fluid with a thin needle is called fine needle aspiration (FNA).''The fluid obtained by FNA can be analyzed for cancerous cells (cytology), amylase content, and for tumor markers. Tumor markers, such as CEA (''carcinoembryonic antigen''), are proteins produced in large quantities by cancer cells. For example, pancreatic pseudocyst fluid will typically have high amylase levels but low CEA levels. A benign serous cyst adenoma will have low amylase and low CEA levels, whereas a precancerous or cancerous mucinous cyst adenoma will have low amylase levels but high CEA levels. Most recently, DNA from cells that are aspirated from the cyst has been analyzed for changes suggestive of cancer.''The risks of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration are small and consist of a very small incidence of bleeding and infection.''Occasionally, it is difficult even with the diagnostic tools of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration to determine if a pancreatic cyst is cancerous or precancerous. If the answer is not clear, sometimes repeated endoscopic ultrasound and aspiration are done if the suspicion for cancer or precancer is high. In other cases, the cyst is reexamined by CT, MRI, or even endoscopic ultrasound after a few months to detect changes that more strongly suggest that cancer has developed. In still others, surgery is recommended.'  "
What is the treatment for pancreatic cysts?,"'The most important aspect of management of pancreatic cysts is the determination of whether a cyst is benign (and usually needs no treatment) or if it is precancerous or cancerous and must be removed.''The second most important aspect of management is to determine whether a patient with a precancerous or cancerous pancreatic cyst is a suitable surgical candidate. In medical centers experienced in performing pancreatic surgery, surgical removal of precancerous or cancerous cysts results in a high rate of cure.'""Very small cysts can be followed to detect an increase in size that may indicate cancer or an increased risk of developing cancer.\xa0Management decisions must be individualized for each patient after discussions with a doctor familiar with the patient's health status. The following are examples of how a doctor might manage pancreatic cysts.""   Pancreatic pseudocysts need treatment if they persist beyond six weeks after acute pancreatitis, especially if they reach a large size and cause symptoms such as obstruction of the stomach or common bile duct, abdominal pain, or become infected. Small pancreatic cysts (for example, cysts smaller than one cm) will have little chance of being cancerous. Nevertheless, even these small cysts can grow in size and turn cancerous in the future. Thus, these patients are monitored with yearly scans (for example, yearly ultrasound or MRI). The cysts do not have to be evaluated with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If the cysts grow in size and/or cause symptoms, the patient will be evaluated further using endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. Pancreatic cysts larger than 3 cm can be studied with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If fluid cytology, CEA measurements or analysis of DNA suggest cancerous or precancerous changes, the patients can be evaluated for pancreatic surgery."

Some investigators consider this phase 1. Phase 2 signs and symptoms may occur during the disease and may include:''In phase 3, signs and symptoms slowly abate if there are no complications. However, the person may have irritability, ''tiredness'', and low energy for 1-2 months.''Doctors sometimes use the terminology ""incomplete Kawasaki disease"" for patients who receive a diagnosis with only some features of classical Kawasaki disease.''Most patients (about 77%) are under 5 years of age with a peak incidence at 18 months of age. It is the most common acquired ''heart disease'' in children. Complications may include long-term effects of heart problems and coronary artery abnormalities like ''vasculitis''.''Mucocutaneous ''lymph node'' syndrome is the original name for Kawasaki disease.

What are causes of Kawasaki disease?,"'The cause is not known. Microorganisms and toxins like that of ''scarlet fever'' have been suspected, but none has been identified to date.''Kawasaki disease typically affects children under 5 years of age. Only rarely does it affect children over 8 years of age, in which case it is sometimes referred to as atypical Kawasaki disease.' It is common for Kawasaki disease to occur after a preceding infection, such as tonsillitis, ear infection, pneumonia, urine infection, or gastrointestinal infection. Genetic factors (genetic variants in some patients) and the immune system (for example, autoimmune disease) seem to play roles in the disease, which is characterized by immune activation. The disease is more common in those of Japanese or Korean descent."
What are the symptoms and signs of Kawasaki disease?,"'The usual symptoms and signs of Kawasaki disease include''The rash appears in a glove-and-sock fashion over the skin of the hands and feet.

Is Kawasaki disease contagious?,"'No. Kawasaki disease is not believed to be a ''contagious'' illness. However, Kawasaki disease symptoms and signs often start after the patient has had an acute infection with something else. The cause of the preceding illness may be something contagious. ' "
How can Kawasaki disease cause serious complications?,"'Children with Kawasaki disease can develop inflammation of the arteries of various parts of the body.''Because of the potential for heart injury and coronary artery aneurysms, special tests are performed to examine the heart.' This inflammation of the arteries is called vasculitis. Arteries that can be affected include the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle (the coronary arteries). Vasculitis can cause weakening of the blood vessels and lead to areas of vessel widening (aneurysms). The weakening occurs because of the destruction of the elastic tissue in the walls of the blood vessels. Coronary artery aneurysms occur because of such injury to the blood vessels in Kawasaki disease. Children are typically evaluated with an electrocardiogram (EKG) and an ultrasound test of the heart (echocardiogram). Monitoring for this problem is crucial throughout life as it can develop as a late aftereffect of Kawasaki disease. Other arteries that can become inflamed include the arteries of the lungs, neck, and abdomen. These effects can lead to breathing problems, headaches, and abdominal pain, respectively. Blood tests to measure the degree of inflammation (such as C-reactive protein, or CRP, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or ESR) are often used to monitor the activity of the disease."
What is the treatment for Kawasaki disease?,"'Children affected by Kawasaki disease are hospitalized.''Kawasaki disease that is not responding to the traditional cornerstones of treatment, aspirin and gamma globulin infusions, can be deadly.'' Treatments being investigated include ''doxycycline'', statin drugs (''Lipitor'', ''Mevacor'', others), ''anakinra'' (''Kineret''), and ''cyclosporine'' (''Neoral'').'   Kawasaki disease is treated with high doses of aspirin (salicylic acid) to reduce inflammation and to mildly thin the blood to prevent blood clot formation. This is one of the few times when children may take aspirin. Also used in treatment is gamma globulin administered through the vein (intravenous immunoglobulin or IVIG), together with fluids. This treatment has been shown to decrease the chance of developing coronary aneurysms in the coronary arteries, especially when used early in the illness. Sometimes cortisone medications are given. Persisting joint pains are treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve). Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) has been reported as effective in patients who were not responding to aspirin and gamma globulin. Plasmapheresis is a procedure whereby the patient's plasma is removed from the blood and replaced with protein-containing fluids. By taking out portions of the patient's plasma, the procedure also removes antibodies and proteins that are felt to be part of the immune reaction that is causing the inflammation of the disease."
What is the prognosis for children with Kawasaki disease?,"'Kawasaki disease is typically self-limited and generally resolves on its own after four to eight weeks, and with early treatment, full recovery is usual.''Rarely, Kawasaki disease can cause death from ''blood clots'' forming in abnormal areas of widening (aneurysms) of the heart arteries (coronary arteries) and ''myocarditis'' (inflammation of heart muscle). Aneurysms of the arteries to the heart (coronary arteries) can occur early or late, even when the children are adults so follow-up is recommended for those patients diagnosed with the disease. Those children with larger aneurysms have a worse prognosis because of this risk. Such aneurysms can lead to blood clots, ''heart attacks'' (''myocardial infarction''), and ''internal bleeding''. Those whose echocardiograms do not demonstrate widening of the coronary arteries throughout life do best. Those with any signs of ''aneurysm'' changes require very close monitoring. Children less than 6 months of age and those with high levels of inflammation on blood testing are at highest risk.''The earlier the diagnosis is made and treatment is begun the better the outcome.''Researchers are searching for methods of detecting which children are at risk for the development of aneurysms of the coronary arteries. Further research is under way to investigate a variety of criteria for atypical variants of Kawasaki disease that do not have classical presentations.' "
Is it possible to prevent Kawasaki disease?,"'Because the cause of Kawasaki disease has not been determined, there are no measures known that can prevent the disease. ''Early evaluation and treatment can decrease the chance for long-term problems and/or complications.' "
Kawasaki disease and the new multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C),"'Another disease recently noted to have almost identical signs and symptoms to Kawasaki disease has been linked to the ''COVID-19'' (coronavirus) pandemic. The new disease seems more virulent than Kawasaki disease. The CDC named the disease (as of May 14, 2020) multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children or MIS-C. The following is the case definition for MIS-C provided by the CDC:'' The CDC noted the fever should be at least 100.4 F (38 C) for at least 24 hours or a subjective fever lasting 24 hours. The main differences between MIS-C and Kawasaki disease are a more rapid and serious advancement of symptoms, especially fever and multisystem organ problems like cardiac and respiratory problems along with a current or recent infection with ''SARS''-CoV-2. Some children suffer a rapid heartbeat and may develop cardiac and/or respiratory arrest. ' An individual under 21 years of age with fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization with multisystem (>2) organ involvement (cardiac, renal, respiratory, hematologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic or neurological); 
and no alternative plausible diagnoses; and positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, serology, 
or antigen test; or COVID-19 exposure within the 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms."
What is Hunter syndrome?,"'Hunter syndrome is a very rare X - linked recessive inherited disease. Hunter syndrome is a lysosomal storage disease caused by deficient or absent enzyme, iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S). This causes the accumulation of heparin sulfate and dermatan sulfate to accumulate in body tissues. Injury to various organs lead to the symptoms from the disease. Hunter syndrome is also termed Mucopolysaccharidosis II or MPS II.' "
What are the signs symptoms of Hunter syndrome?,"'The symptoms of Hunter syndrome usually are not present at birth, but begin in young children ages about 2-4, and may range from mild to severe. Symptoms include:'   Facial changes such as thickening of 
the lips, nostrils flaring and broadening of the nose Head enlargement (macrocephaly) Tongue protrusion Hoarseness and/or deepening of the 
voice Changes in the bones produces abnormal 
bone size and/or bone shape Joint stiffness Small whitish growths on the skin Enlarged internal organs Distended abdomen Diarrhea Delayed development (for example, child 
does not meet normal development such as talking or normal motor skills like 
walking) Behavior that becomes aggressive Reduced or stunted growth"
What causes Hunter syndrome?,"'The cause of Hunter syndrome is an abnormal gene X chromosome that is inherited from the mother. This genetic abnormality allows mucopolysaccharides to accumulate in large amounts in cells, the blood and in connective tissues. This accumulation causes damage to cells and organs. It is a progressive disease that usually causes a shortened lifespan and major developmental abnormalities. Hunter syndrome occurs almost exclusively in males.' "
Who gets Hunter syndrome?,"'The two major risk factors for Hunter syndrome are a family history of Hunter syndrome, and being male, since predominantly males are affected. Females rarely get the disease because they inherit two X chromosomes so that even if one is defective, the other X chromosome with functioning genes usually can compensate for the abnormality.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat Hunter syndrome?,"'There are a number of physician specialties that may treat Hunter syndrome. Treatment is geared toward managing the symptoms and complications of the disease. There is no cure for this progressive disease. Specialties of physicians that may be involved in caring for persons with Hunter syndrome include pediatric pulmonologists, critical-care specialists, ''emergency medicine'' specialists, orthopedists, geneticists, rheumatologists, internal medicine specialists, neurologists, surgeons and child psychologists. If the child survives to adulthood, similar specialists that treat adults may be consulted.' "
How is Hunter syndrome diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis of Hunter syndrome is sometimes difficult because of its slow onset and overlapping symptoms with other childhood problems. Early signs that suggest a diagnosis include facial changes in the child. The pediatrician then usually completes a detailed personal family history and physical examination of the individual. Blood, urine, and/or tissue samples can be tested for either the deficient enzyme or excess mucopolysaccharides. Definitive diagnosis is done by a genetic analysis of the child's X chromosome(s). There is no routine ""'newborn'' screening available to diagnose Hunter syndrome. However, in families with known Hunter syndrome, prenatal testing of the ''amniotic fluid'' or placental tissue may be available and can verify the diagnosis in a fetus.' "
What is the treatment for Hunter syndrome?,"'Currently, treatment is geared toward managing symptoms and complications as there is no cure for this progressive disease. Treatments depend on the organ(s) involved and can include assistance with ''breathing'"", physical therapy to maintain functions, drainage of fluids to build up in the brain and/or spinal cord, heart valve replacement and other treatments such as behavior management. Some physicians utilize specific enzyme therapy to replace child's deficient enzymes. The treatment is termed enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) using an IV – infused enzyme (Elaprase). It is still being refined along with gene therapy to replace the abnormal part of the X chromosome."" "
What are the complications of Hunter syndrome?,"'Complications of Hunter syndrome are:' Respiratory complications (thickened 
tongue can obstruct breathing) Skeletal problems (abnormal bone 
development and joint problems) Connective tissue (accumulation of 
mucopolysaccharides can cause swelling) Heart (thickened tissue resulting in 
vessel narrowing) Brain (hydrocephalus) Nervous system (thickened membranes 
impede nerve functions) Reduced ability to recover from most 
illnesses"
What is the life-expectancy for a person with Hunter syndrome?,"'The life expectancy the person with Hunter syndrome is reduced and ranges from about 10 to 20 years of age. However, with mild disease, some individuals live into adulthood. Obstruction of breathing or ''heart disease'' are the major causes of death.' "
What are other names for Hunter syndrome?,"'Hunter syndrome is also known as ''Some researchers use subtypes such as MPS IIA and MPS IIB (MPS IIA is severe disease while MPS IIB is mild disease).''There are two other terms that are sometimes confused with Hunter syndrome. ' Mucopolysaccharidosis II,  MPS II, and  MPS 
Disorder II.  The first is Bow Hunter Syndrome, a problem when a person rotates their head and 
causes circulation ischemia in the dominant vertebral artery that produces 
attacks of 
	vertigo, nystagmus and
	ataxia (inability to walk normally). 
	 The 
second term is Hurler Hunter syndrome. This term also is known as Hurler 
syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis I and MPS I), and is closely related to Hunter 
syndrome because it also is an inherited disease that results in a lack of an 
enzyme called alpha- L-iduronidase, which produces similar symptoms and 
outcomes to Hunter syndrome."
What is mucormycosis?,"'Mucormycosis is the general term that indicates any fungal infection caused by various genera of the class Zygomycetes. Another term used in medical and lay publications that means the same is phycomycosis. Mucormycosis can result in an acute, rapidly advancing, and occasionally fatal disease caused by different fungi commonly found in the soil or environment. These ''fungal infections'' are diagnosed relatively infrequently; however, they occur in individual people who are debilitated in some major way (uncontrolled diabetics, immunocompromised patients) and occasionally in groups of people that are injured (often multiple injuries and penetrating injuries that are contaminated with soil and water from the environment). Such groups of people are those that are injured in disasters such as tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes, where otherwise healthy people can have contaminated soil and water inhaled, embedded in wounds, or simply forced into skin, mouth, eyes, and nose by the force of water, soil, or wind pressure. The disease is not passed person to person.''A cluster of mucormycosis infections occurred in people who initially survived devastating tornadoes which struck Joplin, Missouri, on May 23, 2011. Thirteen cases were confirmed, all in persons with severe wounds, including ''fractures'', multiple wounds, penetrating injuries, and blunt trauma. Ten patients required intensive care and five died.''Because the majority of mucormycosis infections are caused by one family member in the class of Zygomycetes (family member Mucoraceae), many clinicians now term the disease mucormycosis instead of zygomycosis, the more ""general"" term. The lay press has used terms like ""''Black Death''"" and ""Zombie disease"" to describe this fungal infection but such terms seldom help people to understand this disease. Such terms may cause misunderstandings between the patients, their families, and the public; many clinicians think these potentially harmful or cruel terms should not be used by responsible individuals.' "
What causes mucormycosis?,"'Zygomycetes represent the general class of fungi that cause mucormycosis. ''Rhizopus arrhizus'' species from the Mucoraceae family are the most commonly identified cause of mucormycosis in humans. Other fungal causes may include Mucor species, ''Cunninghamella bertholletiae'', ''Apophysomyces elegans'', Absidia species, Saksenaea species, ''Rhizomucor pusillus'', Entomophthora species, Conidiobolus species, and Basidiobolus species. Mucoraceae are found worldwide and in the ecosystem are responsible for initiating and decaying most organic material in the environment. Most fungi are identified by their unique morphological appearance (see Figure 1) viewed microscopically and determined by a professional practiced in fungal identification (microbiologist or pathologist).''In general, mucormycosis is an infection not often seen by many doctors because the fungal causes are not readily infectious. Usually an infection develops because of some unusual circumstance that places the fungi in contact with compromised or injured animal or human tissue. However, once established, the fungi can rapidly multiply in blood vessel walls where it effectively reduces and cuts off blood to tissues, thereby creating its own decaying organic food source resulting in widespread tissue destruction. If this fulminant spread of fungi is not stopped, death is the outcome.' "
What are risk factors for mucormycosis?,"'A risk factor is any debilitating disease process, especially diseases that can yield compromised blood flow to tissue. The classic example is the patient with uncontrolled ''diabetes'' and foot ulcers where dirt or debris can easily reach compromised tissue. Patients with ''burns'', malignancies, immunocompromised patients, patients with a splenectomy, and people with wounds (usually severe) that have been contaminated with soil or environmental water are at higher risk to get mucormycosis. Consequently, people injured in environmental disasters are, as a group, at high risk for this infection.'  "
What are mucormycosis symptoms and signs?,"'Most of the symptoms of mucormycosis do not differ to any major extent between the various fungal causes. Most authorities describe the signs and symptoms of the disease according to the predominant or initial body area that is infected. Some patients have more than one body area infected. The following is a list of signs and symptoms (note that many authors prefer the term mucormycosis instead of zygomycosis since the majority of fungi, when identified, are from the Mucoraceae family of fungi):''Although these symptoms suggest that a patient may have mucormycosis, they are not definitive. In addition, they may not develop very quickly because it may take a few days to over a week in many people before the symptoms develop. When they do initially develop, it is not unusual to ascribe the symptoms to causes other than fungi (often to secondary ''bacterial infections''). Consequently, the fungal diagnosis may be delayed (see diagnosis section below).'   Rhinocerebral mucormycosis: fever, headache, reddish and swollen skin over nose and sinuses, dark scabbing in the nose by the eye(s), visual problems, eye(s) swelling, facial pain Pulmonary (lung) mucormycosis: fever, coughing sometimes with bloody or dark fluid production, shortness of breath GI mucormycosis: diffuse abdominal pain, bloody and sometimes dark vomitus, abdominal distension Renal mucormycosis: fever, flank pain Cutaneous mucormycosis: initially, reddish and swollen skin often adjacent to an area of skin trauma, that becomes an ulcer with a dark center and sharply defined edges Disseminated mucormycosis: initially may have any of the above symptoms; as the disease spreads to other organs, headaches, fever, and mental-status changes occur"
How is mucormycosis diagnosed?,"""Presumptive diagnosis is based on the patient's history, physical exam, and the patient's risk factors for getting a fungal infection. A definitive diagnosis is difficult. Although tests such as ""'CT'' or ''MRI'' may help define the extent of infections or tissue destruction, their findings are not specific for mucormycosis. There are no serological or blood tests that are helpful. Growth of the fungi from a biopsy (tissue obtained by surgical removal or endoscopes with biopsy tool) of infected tissue, accompanied by special tissue stains looking for unique structural components, may identify the fungus and help make the definitive diagnosis. This helps distinguish mucormycosis from other fungal diseases such as ''candidiasis'' and ''histoplasmosis''. However, it is still sometimes difficult to determine the specific fungal genus and species infecting the patient. Consequently, mucormycosis is often a ""working"" diagnosis that clinicians use because the supportive care and treatments for the causative fungal agents are essentially the same. Figure 2 shows a periorbital eye infection eventually diagnosed as mucormycosis.' "
What is the treatment of mucormycosis?,"'Treatments of mucormycosis need to be fast and aggressive. The need for speed is because by the time even the presumptive diagnosis is made, often the patient has suffered significant tissue damage that cannot be reversed. Most patients will require both surgical and medical treatments. Most infectious-disease experts say that without aggressive surgical debridement of the infected area, the patient is likely to die. Medications play an important role. Two main goals are sought at the same time: antifungal medications to slow or halt fungal spread and medications to treat any debilitating underlying diseases. Amphotericin B (initially intravenous) is the usual drug of choice for antifungal treatment. In addition, posaconazole or isavuconazole may treat mucormycosis. Patients with underlying diseases like diabetes need their diabetes optimally controlled. Patients normally on steroids or undergoing treatment with deferoxamine (''Desferal''; used to remove excess iron in the body) are likely to have these medications stopped because they can increase the survival of fungi in the body. Patients may need additional surgeries and usually need antifungal therapy for an extended time period (weeks to months) depending on the severity of the disease. Consultation with an infectious-disease expert is advised.'  "
What are complications of mucormycosis?,"'The complications of mucormycosis are serious and are related to the body area initially infected but also can occur in other body regions because the fungi often spread to the organs or tissues that physically contact or are near the originally infected area. In addition, because surgical debridement is almost uniformly needed, some normal tissue may be destroyed because the surgeon must remove all tissue that is dead or dying. Unfortunately, that means the surgeon may have to remove some normal tissue to insure all of the fungi are removed. An example is infection of the eye orbit; often the whole eye must be removed. Consequently, serious complications such as blindness, ''meningitis'', brain abscesses, ''osteomyelitis'', pulmonary hemorrhages, gastrointestinal hemorrhages, cavitary lesions in organs and eventually secondary bacterial infections, ''sepsis'', and death may occur.' "
What is the prognosis of mucormycosis?,"""The prognosis of mucormycosis is usually fair to poor; the prognosis depends on the overall health of the patient, the speed of diagnosis and treatment, the patient's ability to respond to treatments, the complete debridement of the infected body area, and the body area that is initially infected. For example, the mortality (death rate) of patients with rhinocerebral and GI mucormycosis is about 85% while the mortality rate for all patients with other types of mucormycosis is about 50%. Patients who survive this dangerous infection often have disabilities related to the extent of tissue lost due to the fungal destruction and the necessary surgical debridement (blindness, limb loss, organ dysfunctions)."" "
Is it possible to prevent mucormycosis?,"'Avoiding predicted disasters (hurricanes) and taking safety measures if possible (getting to safe shelters if warning of a tsunami, tornado, or earthquake) are probably the best ways to avoid mucormycosis. Patients with debilitating disease can increase their likelihood of avoiding the infection by good control (treatment) of their health problem with diabetes as the classic example. Some clinicians suggest that if a patient is exposed to circumstances that are favorable for mucormycosis to develop, if they are taking ''prednisone'' (''Deltasone'', Orasone, Prednicen-M, ''Liquid Pred'') or deferoxamine (Desferal), they should cease these medications (consult your doctor or emergency center if possible before modifiying medications). Finally, if a person thinks they may have mucormycosis, they should consult their doctor or an emergency center immediately.''There is no vaccine available for mucormycosis. In some instances, there is no good way prevent mucormycosis (severe accidents, lack of disaster warnings, no shelters available).' "
What research is being done on mucormycosis?,"'Unfortunately, very little research is being done on this disease. Most studies available discuss the two major factors. First is the data showing the increasing incidence noted in patients with debilitating diseases, currently with a focus on those who are immunocompromised by diseases or by medical treatment. Second are studies comparing treatment plans of surgery combined with antifungal medication. Currently, surgery and amphotericin B still seem to be the treatments that give the best results. As the incidence and recognition of zygomycosis (mucormycosis) increases, more research may be done.' "
Where can people find more information on mucormycosis?,"'Readers who are not familiar with fungal infections are advised to read any short summary or overviews about the classification, growth, and diseases caused by fungi.''""''Mucormycosis'',"" Medscape''""''Types of Fungal Diseases'',"" CDC' "
What are natural methods of contraception?,"'Natural methods of ''contraception'' are considered ""natural"" because they are not mechanical and not a result of hormone manipulation. Instead, these methods to prevent pregnancy require that a man and woman not have sexual intercourse during the time when an egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.''The ''fertility'' awareness methods'' (FAMs) are based upon knowing when a woman ovulates each month. In order to use a FAM, it is necessary to watch for the signs and symptoms that indicate ''ovulation'' has occurred or is about to occur.'""On the average, the egg is released about 14 (plus or minus 2) days before a woman's next ""'menstrual period''. But because the egg survives 3 to 4 days (6 to 24 hours after ovulation) and the sperm can live 48 to 72 hours (up to even 5 days in ''fertile'' mucus), the actual time during which a woman may become ''pregnant'' is measured not in hours, not in days, but in weeks.''FAMS can be up to 98% effective, but they require a continuous and conscious commitment with considerable monitoring and self-control. Although these methods were developed to prevent pregnancy, they can equally be well used by a couple to increase fertility and promote ''conception''.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of natural birth control?,"'Natural methods are typically very inexpensive compared to other methods of birth control unless a woman chooses to purchase ovulation test kits.' A woman does not need to take medication or use hormonal manipulation. No procedures or fittings by a physician are required. It can be difficult to estimate or know precisely when a woman is fertile, allowing increased chances for unplanned conception. Natural methods are not as effective as some forms of contraception. Ovulation test kits are used by some couples using natural methods of contraception, and the cost of these kits is another potential disadvantage. Being unable to have intercourse at certain times of the month is a disadvantage for some women."
Calendar rhythm method,"""The calendar rhythm method to avoid pregnancy relies upon calculating a woman's fertile period on the calendar. Based upon her 12 previous menstrual cycles, a woman subtracts l8 days from her shortest menstrual cycle to determine her first fertile day, and 11 days from her longest menstrual cycle to determine her last fertile day. She can then calculate the total number of days during which she may ovulate. If a woman's menstrual cycles are quite irregular from month to month, there will be a greater number of days during which she might become pregnant.""'The calendar method is only about 80% effective in preventing pregnancy and when used alone, it is considered outdated and ineffective.' "
Basal body temperature method,"""The basal body temperature (BBT) method is based upon the fact that a woman's temperature drops 12 to 24 hours before an egg is released from her ovary and then increases again once the egg has been released. Unfortunately, this temperature difference is not very large. It is less than 1 degree F (about a half-degree C) when the body is at rest.""'The basal body temperature method requires that a woman take her temperature every morning before she gets out of bed. A special thermometer that is more accurate and sensitive than a typical oral thermometer must be used, and the daily temperature variations carefully noted. This must be done every month. Online calculators are available to help a woman chart her basal body temperature.''To use the basal body temperature as a birth control method, a woman should refrain from having sexual intercourse from the time her temperature drops until at least 48 to 72 hours after her temperature increases again.' "
Mucus inspection method,"'The mucus inspection method depends on the presence or absence of a particular type of cervical mucus that a woman produces in response to estrogen. A woman will generate larger amounts of more watery mucus than usual (like raw egg white) just before release of an egg from her ovary. This so-called egg-white cervical mucus (EWCM) stretches for up to an inch when pulled apart. A woman can learn to recognize differences in the quantity and quality of her cervical mucus by examining its appearance on her underwear, pads, and toilet tissue; or she may gently remove a sample of mucus from the vaginal opening using two fingers.''She may choose to have intercourse between the time of her ''last menstrual period'' and the time of change in the cervical mucus. During this period, it is recommended that she have sexual intercourse only every other day because the presence of seminal fluid makes it more difficult to determine the nature of her cervical mucus. If the woman does not wish to become pregnant, she should not have sexual intercourse at all for 3 to 4 days after she notices the change in her cervical mucus.' "
Symptothermal method,"'The symptothermal method combines certain aspects of the calendar, the basal body temperature, and the mucus inspection methods. Not only are all these factors taken into consideration, but also are other symptoms such as slight cramping and breast tenderness. Some women experience lower abdominal discomfort (in the area of the ovaries) during the release of an egg (ovulation).' "
Ovulation indicator testing kits,"""A woman can use an ovulation prediction kit to determine when she is most likely to ovulate. This special kit measures the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the urine. Because luteinizing hormone promotes the maturation of an egg in the ovary, the amount of LH usually increases 20 to 48 hours before ovulation. This increase is called the luteinizing hormone surge, which can then be detected in a woman's urine 8 to 12 hours later. The ovulation prediction kit is designed to measure the amount of luteinizing hormone in the urine.""'There are a number of ovulation prediction kits sold at pharmacies that range from simple to complex. In the simplest, the woman urinates onto a test stick and the amount of luteinizing hormone is indicated by a color change. The intensity of the color is proportional to the amount of luteinizing hormone in her urine. A woman begins testing her urine 2 to 3 days before she expects to ovulate based upon the dates of her previous monthly cycles.''The optimum days for ''fertilization'' are the two days before ovulation, the day of ovulation, and the day after ovulation. The greatest chance of ''becoming pregnant'' is if intercourse occurs within 24 hours after the luteinizing hormone surge. Ovulation prediction kits are used primarily to increase the chance of a woman becoming pregnant, but they can also indicate to the woman that she is about to ovulate and should take appropriate ''contraceptive'' precautions.' "
Withdrawal method,"""Using the withdrawal method, the man withdraws his penis from a woman's vagina before he ejaculates so that the sperm released from his penis does not enter her vagina. Withdrawal is also called ""'coitus interruptus''.'""There are problems with using withdrawal as a contraceptive method. First, a man may release small amounts of sperm before actual ejaculation. Secondly, a man needs self-control and a precise sense of timing to be able to withdraw his penis from the woman's vagina before he ejaculates. Because this can be difficult for the man to complete successfully, the withdrawal method is only about 75%-80% effective in preventing pregnancy."" "
Lactational infertility,"'Lactational ''infertility'' is based upon the idea that a woman cannot become pregnant as long as she is ''breastfeeding'' her baby. It is true that a woman may not ovulate quite as soon after giving birth as she would if she were not breastfeeding. Women who are breastfeeding usually start ovulating again between 10-12 weeks after delivery.''However, the method is not considered appropriate as a sole contraceptive measure. A ''nursing'' mother may start ovulating again and not realize she is fertile, as ovulation can occur prior to the return of her menstrual period. If this happens and the mother has unprotected sexual intercourse, she can become pregnant at the same time she is still breastfeeding her baby. If a nursing mother does not wish to become pregnant again, she must start to use an appropriate method of contraception.' "
Douching and urination,"'Vaginal ''douching'"" is the use of a liquid solution to wash out mucus and other types of bodily debris from a woman's vagina. Many women choose to make regular douching a part of their routine for maintaining vaginal hygiene. Most doctors and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not recommend the practice.""""Regardless of whether a woman does it for hygienic reasons, vaginal douching does not work as a contraception method. During intercourse, active sperm can reach a woman's cervix and even the upper part of her uterus within five minutes of ejaculation. Douching after intercourse cannot be done soon enough to have any contraceptive benefits, and the douching could even force sperm higher up into the uterus. In addition, if a woman douches within a 6-8 hour period after using a spermicide, she may actually reduce the effectiveness of this contraceptive method.""'Some women used to think that standing up and urinating immediately after sexual intercourse might reduce the chances of them becoming pregnant. They hoped that gravity might make it more difficult for sperm to swim ""uphill"" to the uterus and that the stream of urine ''running'' over their vaginal area would wash away sperm, similar to the process of douching. However, just like douching, urination after intercourse does not have any contraceptive value.' "
Abstinence,"""Abstinence from sexual activity means not having any sexual intercourse at all. No sexual intercourse with a member of the opposite sex means that there is no chance that a man's sperm can fertilize a woman's egg.""""A man or a woman can practice abstinence from sexual activity for a specific period of time, or continuously throughout one's lifetime. Abstinence is essentially 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. Another significant benefit of abstinence is that it markedly reduces the likelihood of contracting a ""'sexually transmitted disease'' (''STD'').''In this context, abstinence means refraining from vaginal, anal, and oral sexual activity because sexually transmitted infections can be passed from one person to another in any and all of these ways. It should be noted that sexual activity such as mutual ''masturbation'"" and touching of the other partner's genitals can, in some instances, transfer sperm during heavy mutual foreplay possibly leading to pregnancy.""

What is drug-resistant tuberculosis?,"'Usually, anti-''tuberculosis'' (anti-''TB'') ''drugs'' have been divided into\xa0''Most people with ''TB'' are cured by following a strict six-month, four-standard anti-TB drug regimen. However, sometimes the bacteria that cause TB, namely ''Mycobacterium ''tuberculosis'', becomes more resistant to treatment and due to mismanagement leads to misuse of anti-TB drugs and reduced patient\xa0 immunity. Further, when anti-TB drugs that are used to cure the disease fail to eradicate microbial activity, it is known as drug-resistant TB.\xa0''Types of drug-resistant TB are as follows' First-line (early/initial treatment) drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin)  Second-line drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin, viomycin, enviomycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ethionamide, prothionamide and cycloserine, terizidone) Monoresistance: This is when one of the first-line anti-TB drugs fails to work against TB infection. Polydrug resistance: This is when more than one first-line anti-TB drugs (except both isoniazid and rifampicin) fail to work against TB infection. Multidrug resistance (MDR): This is when both isoniazid and rifampicin fail to work against TB infection. Extensive drug resistance (XDR): Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is a form of TB that is resistant to at least four of the core anti-TB drugs. XDR-TB involves resistance to the two most powerful anti-TB drugs, namely isoniazid and rifampicin. This is also known as multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). MDR-TB also involves resistance to any of the fluoroquinolones (such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) and to at least one of the three injectable second-line drugs (amikacin, capreomycin or kanamycin). Rifampicin resistance (RR): This is when rifampicin, alone or with other drugs (whether with mono-resistance, MDR, polydrug resistance or XDR), fails to work against TB infection."
What is multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB)?,"'In multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), certain ''strains'' of TB bacteria fail to respond to first-line drugs, which include two of the most powerful anti-TB drugs (isoniazid and rifampicin).''Your risk of MDR-TB is higher if you' Have first-line drugs and they fail to work against TB infection.

Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is a form of MDR-TB infection where several of the most effective anti-TB drugs (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin and at least one of three second-line drugs such as capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin, in addition to isoniazid and rifampicin) fail to work.  Prevalence: According to the 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) report, about 9.6 percent of people with MDR-TB worldwide fo on to develop XDR-TB. The global cure rate for XDR-TB is much lower at 20 percent and it is associated with a 44 percent death rate. Diagnosis: Poor access to second-line drug susceptibility testing (DST) in many parts of the world leads to undiagnosed XDR-TB. All patients who are diagnosed with MDR-TB should be tested for XDR-TB. DST (culture or molecular method) is necessary for early diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB or XDR-TB. The molecular methods (Xpert test) have now revolutionized the diagnosis of MDR-TB involving testing for resistance to three second-line injectable drugs (kanamycin, amikacin and capreomycin) and at least one from the group of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. This technique can provide results within hours. Treatment: Both MDR-TB and XDR-TB infections take substantially longer time to treat than ordinary TB infection, which responds well to drugs. "
Are MDR-TB and XDR-TB curable?,"'Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is practically incurable by standard first-line treatment. However, extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) is resistant to both first- and second-line drugs due to drug misuse and mismanagement. Therefore, XDR-TB treatment becomes even harder. It is therefore very important to manage and control TB infection properly at the initial stage itself.''MDR-TB takes longer than an ordinary TB infection and is difficult to treat because treatment options are limited. Early and accurate diagnosis is very important for effective treatment of MDR-TB. Effective treatment includes a selection of perfect second-line drugs that are available to a doctor who is an expert in treating such cases.\xa0''MDR-TB treatment with second-line drugs is more expensive, weaker and is\xa0 associated with more side effects than first-line drugs, which are used for ordinary drug-responsive TB. Many times, the recommended medicines are not available. Most of these second-line drugs were developed years ago, but they are hardly ever used because they are associated with side effects.\xa0''Microbial-killing activity of second-line TB drugs is very weak. Therefore, MDR-TB generally takes 18 to 24 months to be cured completely. The cure rate for MDR-TB is much lower globally. Sometimes, even more severe drug non-responsive (resistant) TB infection may develop. Coinfections such as human immunodeficiency virus (''HIV'') may increase death rates in patients with MDR-TB.\xa0''XDR-TB treatment options are very seriously limited and patients may respond to even fewer available other medicines. Patients with XDR-TB can still be cured, but with the currently available drugs, the possibility of complete cure becomes lower than in those with ordinary TB or even MDR-TB. Cure of XDR-TB infection depends on the extent of drug responsiveness, disease severity and a person’s immunity. XDR-TB is a highly drug-resistant strain that has significantly worse outcomes and can even be deadly.''Although MDR and XDR-TB infection treatments are very challenging and difficult, a cure is often possible with early identification and proper drug management. Proper infection control measures also require ''prevention'' of bacterial spread. Your healthcare professional will support the patient in addressing obstacles in adherence to TB treatment.' "
What is multiple myeloma? What are plasma cells?,"'Multiple myeloma is a type of ''cancer'' of the plasma cells (a type of white blood cells) of the bone marrow. Plasma cells are protein-making cells that normally produce the different kinds of antibodies of the disease-fighting immune system. In multiple myeloma, the plasma cells undergo a ''malignant'' transformation and become cancerous. These myeloma cells (''cancer'"" cells) stop making different forms of protein in response to the immune system's needs and instead start to produce a single abnormal type of protein sometimes termed a monoclonal or M protein. Multiple myeloma plasma cell populations accumulate in the bone marrow, and these collections of cells called plasmacytomas can erode the hard outer shell or cortex of the bone that normally surrounds the marrow. These weakened bones show thinning of the bone, as seen in nonmalignant ""'osteoporosis'"" or what appear to be punched out or lytic bone lesions. These lesions may cause pain and even breaks or fractures of the weakened bones. They may cause other systemic problems listed below. People often refer to multiple myeloma simply as myeloma (also termed Kahler's disease after the physician who first described this cancer). The disease usually occurs in people past middle age. However, rarely it can occur in a child.""'The National Cancer Institute also notes that one type of myeloma-related plasma cell neoplasm is called a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). In MGUS, medical professionals only find low levels of M protein and people have no symptoms; MGUS infrequently develops into multiple myeloma. Plasma cell neoplasm is another name for multiple myeloma.' "
What causes multiple myeloma?,"'What triggers the ''malignancy'' of plasma cells in multiple myeloma is unknown. The cancerous myeloma plasma cells proliferate and crowd out normal plasma cells and can etch away areas of bones. The proteins produced in large amounts can cause many of the symptoms of the disease by making the blood more thickened (viscous) and depositing the proteins in organs that can interfere with the functions of the kidneys, nerves, and immune system. However, triggers or causes related to multiple myeloma may include toxic chemicals, ''radiation'', some ''viruses'', immune disorders, and family history of the disease or other related problems like MGUS.' "
What are multiple myeloma symptoms and signs?,"'Patients with myeloma may be asymptomatic with an unexplained increase in protein in the blood. With more advanced disease, some myeloma patients may have weakness due to ''anemia'' caused by inadequate production of ''red blood cells'', with bone pain due to the aforementioned bone damage, and as the abnormal M protein can accumulate in and damage the kidneys thereby resulting in a patient being found to have otherwise unexplained kidney damage and decreased kidney function. Multiple myeloma cancer cells may be in or outside the bone marrow.''The following is a list of symptoms and signs of multiple myeloma:'   Anemia Bleeding Nerve damage Skin lesions (rash) Enlarged tongue (macroglossia) Bone tenderness or pain, including back pain Weakness, fatigue or tiredness Infections Pathologic bone fractures Back pain Spinal cord compression Kidney failure and/or other end-organ damage Loss of appetite and weight loss Constipation Hypercalcemia Leg swelling"
What are risk factors for multiple myeloma? Is multiple myeloma hereditary?,"'Medical professionals have not established the definitive cause of multiple myeloma, but research has suggested several factors may be risk factors or contribute to multiple myeloma development in an individual. A genetic abnormality such as c-Myc oncogenes and others have been associated with multiple myeloma development. Currently, there is no evidence that heredity plays a role in multiple myeloma development so it is not considered a hereditary disease. People have suggested environmental exposures to herbicides, insecticides, benzene, hair dyes, and radiation as causes, but definitive data is lacking. Some have suggested inflammation and infection as causes, but again not proven to cause multiple myeloma. However, a benign proliferation of a plasma cell can result in a situation where a monoclonal antibody is produced in high amounts (but not as high as seen with multiple myeloma). This result is termed monoclonal gammopathy of unknown or undetermined significance (abbreviated as MGUS). About 19% of MGUS patients develop multiple myeloma in about two to 19 years after MGUS diagnosis. In addition, smoldering multiple myeloma (also termed inactive) is an early precursor to multiple myeloma. Abnormal proteins in blood or urine are detectable with special testing before ''multiple myeloma symptoms'' occur''.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to make a diagnosis of multiple myeloma?,"'For many patients, physicians first suspect multiple myeloma when a routine blood test shows an abnormal amount of protein in the bloodstream or an unusual stickiness of red blood cells causing them to stack up almost like coins in a pattern called rouleaux, an unusual formation for red blood cells. The health care professional will do a history and physical exam, looking for signs and symptoms (see above) of multiple myeloma. If multiple myeloma is suspected, several studies help confirm the diagnosis. They include a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy most commonly from the large bones of the pelvis. Cells obtained from the marrow are studied by a pathologist to determine if there is one (plasmacytoma) or more (multiple myeloma) abnormal types or numbers of cells. Medical professionals also study a sample of the bone marrow aspirate for more detailed characteristics such as the presence or absence of abnormal numbers or types of chromosomes (DNA) by what is called cytogenetic testing. They may perform other molecular testing on the marrow sample, as well. The ''bone marrow biopsy'' can assess the concentrations of cells in the marrow and the presence of abnormal invasive growth of cellular elements. Blood testing and urine testing (for example, serum ''creatinine'') by several methods can determine levels and types of monoclonal protein produced and if there is kidney damage. The M protein may be a complete form of a type of antibody called an immunoglobulin (IgG or IgA, for example) or only a portion of the protein called a lambda or kappa light chain. Normal antibodies consist of both heavy and light chain components. In 2011, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommended that health care professionals use a serum free light chain assay and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test to further identify multiple myeloma in patients. Most clinicians will use X-ray studies to identify skeletal lesions and ''MRI'' for spinal, paraspinal, or spinal cord lesions in multiple myeloma. In addition, medical professionals also perform several routine tests (''CBC'', ''sedimentation rate'', BUN, ''C-reactive protein'', and others such as beta 2 microglobulin). Bence-Jones proteins, monoclonal polypeptides that compose antibody light chains, may be found in the urine by immunofixation (detection of compounds with antibodies on an electrophoretic gel). Such tests help distinguish between myelomas and ''lymphomas'', such as non-Hodgkin ''lymphoma'' and Hodgkin disease.'  "
What specialties of health care professionals treat multiple myeloma?,"""Although the patient's primary care doctor helps to manage the patient's care, the specialists involved often include an oncologist, hematology pathologist, radiologist, stem cell transplant specialist, and occasionally a surgeon (orthopedist and/or spine surgeon). Researchers like Avet-Loiseau and others are actively seeking better treatments."" "
What are the stages of multiple myeloma?,"'There are four stages of multiple myeloma. While many health care professionals use different staging, these are various stages cited by many clinicians:'""Because staging criteria differ according to different groups, some clinicians simply define the individual's multiple myeloma without assigning a stage and simply estimate a prognosis (see below) for their patient. In 2013, an international group divided stages into three stages based on two criteria, the concentration of beta-2-microglobulin and serum albumin levels; over time, these defined criteria may become widely accepted."" Smoldering: multiple myeloma with no symptoms Stage I: early disease with little anemia, relatively small amount of M protein and no bone damage Stage II: more anemia and M protein as well as bone damage Stage III: still more M protein, anemia, as well as signs of kidney damage"
What is the medical treatment for multiple myeloma?,"""There is no known medical treatment that cures multiple myeloma. However, there are methods to decrease the occurrence and severity of symptoms and prolong life. The therapy is decided based upon the patient's condition and the cancer management team, made with the patient's input. The team will likely involve both a medical specialist in the treatment of myeloma called a medical oncologist, as well as a radiation oncologist and other consultants as appropriate. ""'Oncology'' trained nurses and other personnel will likely be important members of the treatment team.''The choices for treatment(s) often include combinations of drugs, some of which medical professionals give as pills and others by intravenous injection. These include drugs that affect or modulate the immune system, steroids, and some oral or injectable chemotherapy drugs. These are usually used in combinations. There may be a role for high-dose chemotherapy followed by the administration of bone marrow ''stem cells'"" called a stem cell transplant or autotransplantation. Numerous factors come into play in determining whether to do such a transplant. People may obtain further information from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines (NCCN.org), which are updated at least yearly. Other medical treatments may include steroids, bisphosphonate therapy, blood or platelet transfusions, autotransplantation and/or plasmapheresis, and other combination therapy depending on the individual patient's disease stage. Also, researchers use meta-analysis (systematically combining data from selected studies to develop a more significant conclusion) of several studies to help determine better treatment protocols for the disease.""'Radiation therapy may treat painful areas of bone damage. Surgeons can surgically repair broken bones in many cases.''There are many drugs used to treat multiple myeloma. Medical professionals often use the following drugs in combination with ''dexamethasone'"", sometimes orally or by IV, depending on the patient's individual disease status:""'At least seven or eight other drugs that are occasionally used alone or in combination transfusions although the transfusion effects are temporary. Researchers are investigating newer drugs and drug combinations and used for treatment with some frequency. Most health care professionals who specialize in cancer treatment are aware of the newest treatments for multiple myeloma (for example, ''Procrit'', Revlimid, Kyprolis). In addition, your doctor can address the side effects (for example, ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' with chemotherapy) that may occur with treatment. One goal of treatment is progression-free survival; that is the length of time during and after treatment that the patient lives without the symptoms worsening. In addition, low-dose therapy with drugs is being studied in elderly multiple myeloma patients. Risk-adapted therapy is another treatment approach with the design to minimize late disease effects while not compromising the chance for another potential cure.'   Dexamethasone (Decadron) -- immune cell modulation Bortezomib (Velcade) -- protease inhibitor Lenalidomide (Revlimid) -- immune cell modulation Pamidronic acid (Aredia) -- inhibits bone resorption Zoledronic acid (Zometa) -- inhibits bone resorption Melphalan (Alkeran) -- alkylating agent that is toxic to myeloma cells Carfilzomib (Kyprolis) -- protease inhibitor that is FDA approved usually for patients who have failed a previous treatment Daratumumab (Darzalex) -- monoclonal antibody that may damage or kill multiple myeloma cells (and others) that have CD38 protein on their surface Elotuzumab (Empliciti) -- a compound that activates the body's natural killer cells to destroy multiple myeloma cells, usually in combination with Revlimid and Decadron Ninlaro (Ixazomib) -- This proteasome inhibitor, in combination with Revlimid and dexamethasone, improves the survival rates of some patients with multiple myeloma."
What are lifestyle and diet tips for people with multiple myeloma?,"'To stay healthy, lifestyle changes can help individuals with multiple myeloma. Physicians recommend giving up tobacco, reducing ''alcohol'' intake, eating better, and getting more ''exercise''. Eating better may be difficult because of changes in your ''diet'' and tastes. After multiple myeloma treatments, it can be helpful to eat small meals about two to three hours apart until you feel as if you can eat a larger meal. During treatment, ''fitness'' or endurance and muscle strength can decline. For ''exercise'', start slowly by taking short walks or getting involved with an exercise program that gradually increases without pushing the body too hard.' "
What is the prognosis for multiple myeloma? What is the survival rate for multiple myeloma?,"""The prognosis of multiple myeloma is variable, depending on the approximate stage and response to therapy. Though there is no cure for the disease, today's treatments are more effective and less toxic (have fewer side effects) than did many in the past. Multiple myeloma is a focus of active ongoing research. The median survival rate, beginning at the point of first treatment according to the American Cancer Society (ACS), according to stage of the disease is as follows:""'However, the ACS suggests that with treatment improvements, current survival rates are likely better. Unfortunately, life expectancy after relapse averages about nine months.''Complications of multiple myeloma may include kidney insufficiency, ''bleeding disorders'', bone problems like pathological fractures, hypercalcemia, and neurological problems (for example, spinal cord compression, intracranial plasmacytomas, and others).'   Stage I, 62 months Stage II, 44 months Stage III, 29 months"
Is it possible to prevent multiple myeloma?,"'Because health care professionals do not fully understand the risk factors for multiple myeloma, it is not a preventable disease. Currently, there is no cure for the disease. Even some individuals who recommend herbal home remedies like cayenne peppers suggest that patients use the herbals with drugs. Individuals should discuss the use of home remedies with their doctor before use.' "
What support systems are available for multiple myeloma?,"""The International Myeloma Foundation (IMF) can provide caregivers and patients information about many aspects of this disease. IMF's phone number is 1-800-452-2873. There are local, state, and national support groups for multiple myeloma and for palliative care.""  "
What is the latest research on multiple myeloma?,"""Experimental studies on multiple myeloma have shown that if stem cells from patients with multiple myeloma are grown in cell culture, patients can improve but could also relapse because the stem cells often were contaminated with a few multiple myeloma cells. However, myxoma virus kills human multiple myeloma cells but not stem cells. Consequently, if stem cells for multiple myeloma patients are treated with myxoma viruses, the patient's stem cells are not contaminated multiple myeloma cells. Researchers have used this method to provide multiple myeloma patients with uncontaminated stem cells successfully preventing relapse of multiple myeloma due to contaminated stem cell cultures.""""Myxoma viruses exclusively infect rabbit's cells and are not infectious to humans, so the researchers tried another method. In a mouse model of multiple myeloma, researchers injected the mice with the myxoma viruses and impressively, according to the researchers, 25% of mice had a complete eradication of multiple myeloma and no evidence of relapse. Researchers plan to try to improve this technique in humans and improve the remission rate."" "
What is multiple myeloma?,"'Multiple myeloma'' is a ''cancer'' of the plasma cells. The plasma cells are a type of white blood cell present in the bone marrow. Plasma cells are part of the immune system and help fight against infections by producing antibodies that recognize and attack microorganisms. In multiple ''myeloma'', ''cancer'' cells accumulate in the bone marrow and replace healthy blood cells. The cancerous plasma cells multiply rapidly and have definite bodily functions. Instead of producing beneficial antibodies, the ''cancer'' cells produce abnormal proteins called monoclonal protein or M protein, which cause complications. Multiple myeloma can eventually damage the bones, immune system, kidneys, and ''red blood cells''. Initially, the symptoms may be generalized and nonspecific, such as ''loss of appetite'', bone ''pain'', and ''fever''. Sometimes, a ''fracture'' of a bone on a minor fall or a spine ''fracture'' without any history of ''trauma'' may lead to the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer after ''leukemia''. Multiple myeloma is considered treatable but is generally incurable and hence may be called chronic.' "
What causes multiple myeloma?,"'The exact cause of multiple myeloma is not known, but certain factors can increase the risk of multiple myeloma:' Increasing age: The risk of multiple myeloma increases after the age of 60 years. Male sex Black race Family history of multiple myeloma Personal history of a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS): Multiple myeloma can have a relatively benign condition called MGUS that is characterized by elevated levels of an abnormal protein called M protein, same as in multiple myeloma."
What are the stages of multiple myeloma?,"'It’s important to remember that the outlook for everyone with multiple myeloma is different. Your treatment options and the general state depend on various factors. Most doctors divide multiple myeloma into four stages:''Smoldering stage:'' Myeloma that doesn’t present with active symptoms is called the “smoldering stage.” It may be undetectable in the blood in this stage.\xa0''Stage 1:'' In this stage, a small number of myeloma cells appear in the blood and urine. The ''hemoglobin'' levels may drop slightly. Bone ''X-rays'' may look normal or show only one affected area.''Stage 2: ''A moderate number of myeloma cells are present. Hemoglobin levels drop further. Monoclonal immunoglobulin and blood calcium levels may increase. X-rays may show several areas of bone damage.''Stage 3: ''This is the final stage of multiple myeloma. A high number of myeloma cells are present. The hemoglobin level drops below 8.5 grams per deciliter. Blood calcium levels are high. There are multiple areas of bone destruction due to cancer on the X-ray.' "

Regular follow-up is advised to monitor the progress of the disease.''In the presence of symptoms:''Treatment options for multiple myeloma depend on the stage and severity of the disease. A combination of more than one treatment modality may be advised. Treatment options include:' Targeted therapy: Targeted drug treatment focuses on specific abnormal proteins within cancer cells. These drugs bind to these proteins and kill the cancer cells. They may be administered intravenously or orally. Biological therapy: They stimulate the immune system cells to identify and attack cancer cells. These medications are usually taken orally. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy drugs kill fast-growing cells, including myeloma cells. They may be administered intravenously or orally. Corticosteroids: They suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation in the body. A corticosteroid may be administered orally or intravenously. Bone marrow transplant: A bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow. Radiation therapy: This treatment uses beams of radiation energy, such as X-rays, to target and kill myeloma cells."
What is the prognosis of multiple myeloma?,"'The prognosis of multiple myeloma depends on age. Younger patients usually do better than older patients. Other underlying medical conditions may also affect the prognosis. Some may be asymptomatic for a long time, with a slow progression of cancer. Patients who respond well to initial treatment and experience complete remission (symptom-free periods) have a better prognosis. After treatment, regular follow-up testing and disease management care is required.

What does multiple sclerosis (MS) look like (pictures)?,"'Multiple sclerosis is a disease that involves an immune-mediated process that results in an abnormal response in the body\'s immune system that damages central nervous system (CNS) tissues in which the immune system attacks myelin, the substance that surrounds and insulate nerves fibers causing demyelination that leads to nerve damage. Because the exact antigen or target of the immune – mediated attack is not known, many experts prefer to label multiple sclerosis as ""immune-mediated instead of an autoimmune disease.""' "
What is multiple sclerosis (MS)?,"""Multiple sclerosis is a disease that causes demyelination of the brain and spinal cord nerve cells. When this occurs, axons (the parts of the nerve cells that conduct impulses to other cells), don't work as well. Myelin acts like insulation on electrical wires. As more areas or nerves are affected by this loss of myelin, patients develop symptoms because the ability of axons to conduct impulses is diminished or lost. The specific symptom that someone experiences is related to the area that has been affected. As demyelination takes place, areas of inflammation and subsequent injury can be identified; these areas of injury are called lesions or plaques and are readily apparent on ""'magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI) studies.' "
Can children and teenagers develop multiple sclerosis (pediatric MS)?,"'Children and teenagers can have MS (pediatric MS). It is estimated that about 8,000 to 10,000 children and teens up to 18 years old have been diagnosed with pediatric MS. Moreover, an additional 10,000 to 15,000 children and teens have had at least one symptom of the disease.''Almost all children diagnosed with pediatric MS have the relapsing-remitting MS type; however, additional symptoms often not experienced in adults with MS may include ''seizures'' and mental status changes like lethargy.''Children and teens with multiple sclerosis are treated with the same therapies as adults, but they are considered “off label” for treating children, (not an FDA approved use for the drug, but it is/may be effective for some people with the condition). Small studies suggest the IV drug natalizumab (''Tysabri'') is safe to use in children with MS who have not responded to other treatments. Discuss all of your child’s ''MS treatments'' or home therapies with his or her health-care team.' "
What are the early symptoms and signs of multiple sclerosis?,"'Multiple sclerosis symptoms'' are dependent on the area of the destruction of the myelin sheath protecting the nerves (demyelination).''Early signs and symptoms are vision problems like ''double vision'' or ''vision loss''.''Other symptoms and signs may include:'   Visual changes, including loss of vision if the optic nerve has been affected Double vision A sensation or feeling of numbness, tingling, or weakness. The weakness may be mild or severe enough to cause paralysis of one side of the body Vertigo (a sense of spinning) or dizziness Lack of coordination of the arms or legs, problems with balance, problems walking, and falling Slurred speech A sense of an electrical charge traveling down the spine with neck flexion (Lhermitte sign) In some cases, a person may develop incontinence or even an inability to empty their bladder. As the condition progresses, some people are left with muscle spasticity, or an involuntary painful contraction of certain muscles."
What causes multiple sclerosis?,"""While multiple sclerosis is considered an autoimmune disorder, the exact cause hasn't yet been found. There are many theories regarding the reason that people develop MS. These theories range from ""'vitamin D deficiency'"" to a viral infection. Even consuming too much salt is being looked at as possible causes. However, none of these theories has been proven, and the cause of MS remains unknown. It's not ""'contagious'"", and can't be passed from person to person.""  "
Is multiple sclerosis hereditary? What is the life expectancy?,"'Genetic factors'"" don't seem to play a large role in the disease. Although people who have a first-degree relative with MS have a slightly higher risk of developing it themselves, this risk is felt to be modest.""'People who live in northern latitudes'' (especially Northern European countries) were previously identified as having a higher incidence of the MS. However, over the last 30 years, more cases of MS are now being diagnosed in more temperate regions such as Latin America. Moreover, living in an area until approximately age 15 seems to give someone the relative risk of developing MS for that area. People younger than 15 who move assume the risk of the new location.''Lifestyle factors are not risk factors'' for developing MS, for example, ''diet'', ''exercise'', tobacco use, unlike conditions in which these risk factors are very important, such as ''stroke'', ''heart disease'', or ''diabetes''.' "
How common is multiple sclerosis? Who develops the disease?," Multiple sclerosis occurs predominantly in younger persons, with those aged 15 to 60 most likely to be diagnosed. The average age of diagnosis is about 30 years; however, multiple sclerosis has been identified at all ages. While multiple sclerosis can occur in children, this is very rare. About 2.5 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with MS; of those, about 400,000 live in the United States. Women are about twice as likely as men to develop multiple sclerosis."
What are the four types of multiple sclerosis?,"'There are four types of multiple sclerosis.''Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most common form of MS.''People with this form of the disease develop symptoms that respond to treatment and then resolve. The development of symptoms is often referred to as an exacerbation of the disease. Episodes of remission may last for weeks to years.'""Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) is diagnosed when the problems caused by an exacerbation don't fully resolve during a remission. This often occurs in patients who were initially diagnosed with RRMS. Over time, patients are identified with progressive debility.""'Primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) progresses over time, without episodes of remission or improvement of symptoms.''Progressive-relapsing multiple sclerosis (PRMS) is identified when patients experience escalating symptoms over time, as well as intermittent episodes of remission.'  "
What procedures and tests diagnose MS?,"'Patient history important because many people with multiple sclerosis have experienced various symptoms, which were ignored or attributed to other events or illnesses. If a person recalls no prior symptoms, the remaining medical history is needed to exclude other conditions that might mimic multiple sclerosis.''Once the history is obtained, a complete physical examination is required. Doctors look for signs of injury to the central nervous system (either the brain or spinal cord); findings on the examination can help a doctor determine which area of the central nervous system (CNS) is involved.''Imaging studies help to confirm a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The most common test done is a magnetic resonance image, or MRI. ''CT scans'', while helpful in finding some brain injuries, are unable to reveal the changes associated with multiple sclerosis with as much detail as an MRI. ''MRIs'' can be used to image the brain and the spinal cord.''A ''spinal tap'', or lumbar puncture, is done to collect a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid. Testing can be done on this fluid to confirm the presence of protein, inflammatory markers, and other substances. With the routine use of MRI, performing a spinal tap is not considered mandatory, unless there are questionable findings on the MRI or other questions to answer.''Evoked potential testing (visual evoked potentials, brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and somatosensory evoked potentials) can show slowed response times in the optic nerve, the auditory nerve, the spinal cord, or the brainstem. While helpful, these tests are not specific for changes seen in multiple sclerosis.''When multiple sclerosis is suspected, blood work and testing to exclude other conditions, such as ''Lyme disease'', ''vasculitis'', ''lupus'', ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV''), and processes which lead to multiple ''strokes'', are often done as well.'  "
How is multiple sclerosis treated?,"'Many factors go into consideration for the treatment of a patient who has multiple sclerosis. During an acute exacerbation, steroids given through an IV are commonly prescribed, and often help patients recover more rapidly. If a patient cannot receive steroids, plasma exchange can be used.''Steroids given through an IV are commonly used to treat acute exacerbation of the disease, and often help people recover more quickly. If an individual cannot receive steroids, plasma exchange can be used.''Once a diagnosis has been confirmed, disease-modifying therapy is often recommended. This therapy may decrease the number of exacerbations that a patient experiences or decrease the severity of an exacerbation. In addition, many of these therapies have been shown to decrease the potential for developing long-term disability.'

Multiple sclerosis medications,"'Interferon therapies (''Avonex'', Betaseron, Extavia, Rebif, ''Plegridy'') must be given by an injection. The frequency of injections ranges from every other day to every other week. Some patients develop ''flu-like symptoms'' or nodules under the skin following each injection; other patients may develop severe ''depression''.''Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) works along a different path than the interferons, but is still thought to modify the immune system and has been shown to reduce relapses. Other oral medications have been approved to treat multiple sclerosis are ''fingolimod'' (''Gilenya'') and ''teriflunomide'' (''Aubagio'').''Although these medications are dosed orally, there is a risk of significant side effects:''Another oral agent, dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), may function by preventing immune cells from attacking cells located in the central nervous system, and may have anti-inflammatory properties.''Dalfampridine'' (''Ampyra'') has been approved to help with walking problems caused by multiple sclerosis. The specific way in which this medication works is unknown. There is a risk that this medication may cause seizures, even in patients without a history of ''seizure'' or ''epilepsy''. As such, the use of this medication needs to be monitored carefully.''Natalizumab (Tysabri) is a monoclonal antibody, and has been approved for patients who have relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Because of significant side effects, including the risk of severe brain infection, it is typically used for patients who have failed to respond to one of the interferon products or who have been diagnosed with very active disease.''Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) can also decrease the relapse rate in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. However, because of the risk of serious side effects, it is currently limited to use in patients who have failed other agents.''Mitoxantrone'' (''Novantrone'') is a ''chemotherapy'' agent for ''leukemia'' or ''prostate cancer'', which has been shown to be of benefit in treating secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis, progressive-relapsing multiple sclerosis, and advanced relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.\xa0Of note, mitoxantrone and Betaseron are the only medications identified to help patients with relapsing-primary multiple sclerosis.''Cladribine (Mavenclad) oral tablets is a drug used to treat two forms of multiple sclerosis; relapsing forms that include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease in adults.

What is the life expectancy for a person with multiple sclerosis? Can you die?,"'People with multiple sclerosis are believed to have the same life expectancy of those without multiple sclerosis. However, those with severe, progressive forms of MS may have problems caused by the disability may lead to complications such as ''pneumonia''.''If patients are not treated, over 30% may develop pronounced problems with mobility. It is not yet known what the long-term outcome of patients who begin treatment at an early stage of their disease will be.''There are two extremes in multiple sclerosis. The first is a ""benign"" syndrome in which patients have numerous lesions identified on MRI imaging, but have few -- if any -- symptoms, even decades after their diagnosis. At the opposite end of the spectrum is a condition identified as the Marburg variant of multiple sclerosis, where rapidly progressive symptoms are seen and death may occur after a very short time.'  "
Can you prevent multiple sclerosis?,"'Without a clearly defined cause of multiple sclerosis, ways to prevent this disease have not yet been identified. Exercising regularly, getting sufficient ''sleep'', or eating healthy meals will be of long-term benefit for many people, but have not been shown to be of help to prevent the development of multiple sclerosis.' "
Which types of doctors and specialists treat multiple sclerosis?,"'Speech pathologist:'' A speech pathologist can help patients improve speech clarity, and some can even work on cognitive exercises for patients who have problems with memory. If ''swallowing problems'' are identified, speech pathologists can help determine the cause and whether therapy will help improve swallowing ability or if dietary changes are needed.''Primary care provider: ''A primary care provider such as a family doctor or internist is needed to help keep patients with MS in good health by keeping track of ''blood pressure'', ''cholesterol'', glucose, immunization status, and other factors.''Radiologist:'' A radiologist reads the imaging studies obtained to monitor the status of patients with MS by comparing current studies to prior studies, doctors can determine if the disease has stabilized.''Physical therapist:'' Physical therapists work to help patients regain mobility or strength. They also help patients determine how maintain their strength and mobility after a chronic disease is diagnosed.''Occupational therapist: ''Occupational therapists often work closely with physical therapists to help with mobility issues due to MS. Moreover, these therapists also teach people with MS how to adjust or modify things in their surroundings and homes by using tools or actions to safely perform daily activities.''Clinical psychologist:'' A clinical psychologist can help patients with MS who are experiencing ''depression'', ''anxiety'', or who need help in coping with their diagnosis. Psychologists provide counseling or ''psychotherapy''; they do not prescribe medications. On occasion, they work closely with psychiatrists who determine if medications are needed, and if so, which medications to prescribe.''Neurologist'':'' A neurologist is a doctor who has specialized training in diseases of the brain and nervous system. Some neurologists have additional training in treating multiple sclerosis.' "
What research is being done on multiple sclerosis?,"'Many areas related to the diagnosis and treatments of multiple sclerosis are being explored. These include more in-depth analysis of genetic factors, including factors, which may help with the diagnosis and prediction of patient response to treatment options. ''Drugs'"" that show promise in eliminating or preventing new multiple sclerosis lesions from forming are being evaluated. These new MS medications include drugs in pill form and by injection. A good animal model of multiple sclerosis has not been yet developed. Researchers think that a working animal model would help with the development of medications to treat multiple sclerosis. Stem cell therapy, which may help reboot a patient's immune system so that multiple sclerosis lesions no longer form, is being evaluated more closely."" "
What is multiple sclerosis?,"'Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is an autoimmune condition disease of the central nervous system in which the body attacks the myelin sheath, the protective covering around the nerves. This results in a disruption of information signals between the body and the brain that can cause neurological symptoms that very widely in severity.''According to The National Multiple Sclerosis Society, multiple sclerosis is more prevalent in women of childbearing age than in any other group. The usual age of onset of multiple sclerosis is between 20 and 50, and at least two to three times more women than men are diagnosed with the disease.' "
How do you know if you have multiple sclerosis (symptoms and signs)? ,"'Symptoms and signs of multiple sclerosis include:' Overwhelming fatigue Walking difficulties Numbness or tingling Muscle spasticity (stiffness and spasms) Weakness Vision problems Dizziness and spinning sensation (vertigo) Bladder dysfunction Sexual difficulties Bowel problems (constipation, loss of bowel control) Pain Cognitive problems (difficulty processing information, problems learning or remembering, problems with organization, problem-solving, inability to focus or pay attention) Emotional changes (mood swings, irritability) Depression"
Can multiple sclerosis symptoms and signs worsen during pregnancy?,"'Multiple sclerosis may make carrying a pregnancy more challenging in some women.''Studies have actually shown that pregnancy reduces the number of MS relapses, especially in the second and third ''trimesters''. It is thought that the increase in circulating proteins and other natural immunosuppressants combined with elevated levels of natural corticosteroids in pregnant women may result in women with MS experiencing fewer relapses during pregnancy. However, relapses (flares) in in the first three to six months following childbirth are 20%-40% more likely to occur. The good news is that the postpartum relapses do not seem to increase the progression of MS or the rate of long-term disability.'  Fatigue is the most common symptom of MS, and pregnant MS women may experience greater fatigue. Women with MS who have pre-existing problems walking or balance problems may find these symptoms worsen later in pregnancy as they gain baby weight and their center of gravity shifts. Bladder and bowel problems are common in all pregnancies, and these symptoms may be worse in women with MS who already have urinary or bowel dysfunction. Women with MS who are in wheelchairs may have an increased risk of urinary tract infections."
Can pregnancy cause multiple sclerosis?,"'Pregnancy does not cause multiple sclerosis, but if you have undiagnosed MS you may experience symptoms for the first time during pregnancy.' "
What problems can multiple sclerosis cause during pregnancy?,"  Having multiple sclerosis can make delivery more difficult. Pain sensations may be altered in people with MS, which means a woman may not feel pain with contractions. This can make it difficult to tell when labor begins. The pelvic muscles and nerves used for pushing during delivery may also be weakened. Some women with MS may require the help of forceps or vacuum to assist with delivery, or may need a Cesarean birth (C-section)."
Can multiple sclerosis affect fertility?,"'MS does not seem to affect fertility and a woman’s ability to become pregnant. There is also no evidence of an increased number of spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, or ''birth defects'' in women with MS. One small study showed a significant increase in ''multiple sclerosis symptoms'' after fertility treatments (assisted reproduction technology, or ART). Women with MS should discuss possible risks of these treatments with their doctors.' "
What multiple sclerosis drugs are safe to take while trying to conceive or during pregnancy?,"  If you have MS and are trying to get pregnant, talk to your doctor about what medications you may be able to take. Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMTs) is not approved for use during pregnancy as it may harm a developing baby. The one exception is glatiramer acetate (Copaxone or generic Glatopa). Interferon betas including interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Plegridy, Rebif) and interferon beta-1b (Betaseron) may also be safe to take during pregnancy. Many drugs used to for treatment of MS symptoms may also have adverse effects on a fetus and should not be used during pregnancy, including baclofen (Gablofen, Lioresal) for spasticity, fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem) for depression, and solifenacin succinate (VESIcare) for bladder management. Corticosteroids for acute MS relapses can often be taken during pregnancy. All forms of anesthesia are considered safe for women with MS during labor and delivery. Disease-modifying drug therapy is not recommended during breastfeeding because it is unknown if it passes into breast milk"
What if I am diagnosed with multiple sclerosis while I’m pregnant?,"'If you are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis while pregnant, talk to your doctor about the best ways to manage your pregnancy and your disease. You may not be able to take certain medications for your ''MS symptoms''; however, there is no evidence that having MS will cause harm to your baby.' "
What is MS (multiple sclerosis)?,"'Multiple sclerosis'' (''MS'') is a disease that causes ''demyelination'', or disruption of the substance that coats and protects nerve cells, in the ''spinal nerve'' and brain cells. The specific symptoms and severity of the disease are related to the exact areas of the nervous system that are affected and the extent of the damage to the myelin. Therefore, ''MS'' can cause many different kinds of signs and symptoms in areas throughout the body.''Multiple sclerosis'' occurs predominantly in younger persons, with those aged 15 to 60 most commonly diagnosed with the condition. The average age of diagnosis is about 30 years; however, ''multiple sclerosis'' has been identified at all ages but is rare in children.''People who have a first-degree relative with ''MS'' tend to have a slightly higher risk for developing the disease, but overall, genetic or hereditary factors are not believed to play a significant role in determining who develops ''MS''.' "
Is MS painful?,"'While many of the ''symptoms of MS'' are not associated with ''pain'' (see below), painful involuntary muscle contractions can occur in some people with ''MS''. The burning and tingling sensations of MS can also be painful. In total, over half of all people with MS report experiencing some kind of short-term or long-term ''pain''.' "
What are the early warning signs and symptoms of MS?,"'The early signs and ''symptoms of MS'' depend upon which areas of the brain or spinal cord are affected. Therefore, symptoms can vary greatly among individuals. Not all people with MS will have the same symptoms.''Examples of possible symptoms include one or more of the following:'  Vision changes Double vision Blurred vision Loss of vision Numbness Tingling Burning or stabbing sensations Weakness that can be mild to severe Painful involuntary muscle contractions Paralysis Vertigo Dizziness or lightheadedness Erectile dysfunction in men Pregnancy problems in women Urinary problems Urinary retention Incontinence of urine Urinary frequency Urinary urgency Nocturia (night-time urination) Slurred speech Constipation Changes in sex drive or sexual response Tremors Headaches Itching Swallowing difficulty Fatigue Muscle spasms Poor muscle coordination Gait disturbances Hearing loss Balance problems Cognitive changes Difficulty concentrating Problems with reasoning Memory problems Reduced attention span Difficulty with problem-solving Emotional changes Anxiety Depression Stress"
Are the early signs and symptoms for MS different in men and women?,"'Any of the early signs and symptoms of MS can occur in both men and women and are not specific. However, certain symptoms such as ''pregnancy'' problems or ''erectile dysfunction'' (''ED'', ''impotence''), are gender-specific symptoms.' "
What are the early signs and symptoms of MS progression (stage)?,'Signs and symptoms of MS progression can include worsening of any of the signs and symptoms mentioned above as well as the development of additional symptoms listed above that were not present at the initial diagnosis.' 
What are the 4 types of MS?,"'There are four different types of MS:'  Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most common form of MS. People with this type of MS develop symptoms that respond to treatment and then resolve. Episodes of remission may last for weeks to years. Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) occurs when the symptoms of an exacerbation don't fully resolve during a remission. Primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) progresses over time, without episodes of remission. Progressive-relapsing multiple sclerosis (PRMS) occurs when there are escalating symptoms over time along with intermittent episodes of remission."
What Is Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'Sometimes brain ''seizures'' begin in a vital area of the brain -- for example, in areas that control movement, feeling, language, or memory. When this is the case, a relatively new ''epilepsy treatment'' called multiple subpial transection (MST) may be an option. MST stops the ''seizure'' impulses by cutting nerve fibers in the outer layers of the brain (''gray matter''), sparing the vital functions concentrated in the deeper layers of brain tissue (white matter).' "
Who Is a Candidate for Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'Most people with ''epilepsy'' can control their ''seizures'' with medication. However, about 20% of people with ''epilepsy'' do not improve with ''drugs''. In some cases, surgery to remove the part of the brain causing the seizures may be recommended.''MST may be an option for people who do not respond to medication and whose seizures begin in areas of the brain that cannot be safely removed. In addition, there must be a reasonable chance that the person will benefit from surgery. MST may be done alone or with the removal of a section of brain tissue (resection). MST also may be used as a treatment for children with ''Landau-Kleffner syndrome'' (LKS), a rare childhood brain disorder which causes seizures and affects the parts of the brain that control speech and comprehension.' "
What Happens Before Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'Candidates for MST undergo an extensive pre-surgery evaluation -- including ''seizure'' monitoring, electroencephalography (''EEG''), ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), and positron emission tomography (PET). These tests help to pinpoint the area in the brain where the seizures occur and determine if surgery is feasible.'""Another test to assess electrical activity in the brain is EEG-video monitoring, in which video cameras are used to record seizures as they occur, while the EEG monitors the brain's activity. In some cases, invasive monitoring -- in which electrodes are placed inside the skull over a specific area of the brain -- is also used to further identify the tissue responsible for seizures."" "
What Happens During Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'MST requires exposing an area of the brain using a procedure called a craniotomy. (""Crani"" refers to the skull and ""otomy"" means ""to cut into."") After the patient is put to ''sleep'' with anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision (cut) in the ''scalp'', removes a piece of bone and pulls back a section of the dura, the tough membrane that covers the brain. This creates a ""window"" in which the surgeon inserts his or her surgical instruments. The surgeon utilizes information gathered during pre-surgical brain imaging to help identify the area of abnormal brain tissue and avoid areas of the brain responsible for vital functions.''Using a surgical microscope to produce a magnified view of the brain, the surgeon makes a series of parallel, shallow ''cuts'' (transections) in gray matter, just below the pia mater (subpial), the delicate membrane that surrounds the brain (it lies beneath the dura). The cuts are made over the entire area identified as the source of the seizures. After the transactions are made, the dura and bone are fixed back into place, and the scalp is closed using ''stitches'' or staples.' "
What Happens After Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'After MST, the patient generally stays in an intensive care unit for 24 to 48 hours and in a regular hospital room for three to four days. Most people who have MST will be able to return to their normal activities, including work or school, in six to eight weeks after surgery. Most patients will continue to take anti-seizure medication. Once seizure control is established, medications may be reduced or eliminated.' "
How Effective Is Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'MST results in satisfactory improvement in seizure control in about 70% of patients, although the procedure is still relatively new, and no long-term outcome data are available. Children with LKS or other forms of ''epilepsy'' not controlled by medication may have improved intellectual and psychosocial functioning following MST.' "
What Are the Side Effects of Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'The following side effects may occur after MST, although they generally go away on their own over several weeks:' Scalp numbness. Nausea. Feeling tired or depressed. Headaches. Difficulty speaking, remembering, or finding words."
What Risks Are Associated With Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'The risks associated with MST include:''WebMD Medical Reference' Risks associated with surgery, including infection, bleeding, and an allergic reaction to anesthesia. Failure to relieve seizures. Swelling in the brain. Damage to healthy brain tissue."
Facts you should know about mumps (parotitis)," Mumps is a highly contagious viral infection. Mumps has an incubation period of 14-18 days from exposure to onset of symptoms. The duration of the disease is approximately seven to 10 days. The initial symptoms of mumps infection are nonspecific (low-grade fever, malaise, headache, muscle aches, and loss of appetite). The classic finding of parotid gland tenderness and swelling generally develops the third day of illness. The diagnosis is generally made without the need for laboratory tests. Serious health complications of mumps include meningitis, encephalitis, deafness, and orchitis. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine provides 88% effective immunity against mumps following a two-dosage schedule (12-15 months with booster at 4-6 years of age). A single mumps vaccination protects approximately 78% of individuals against the disease. No specific treatment exists for mumps. Warm or cold packs for the parotid gland tenderness and swelling is helpful. Pain relievers (acetaminophen [Tylenol] and ibuprofen [Advil]) are also helpful. "
What is mumps?,"'Mumps is a vaccine-preventable viral infection transmitted by and affecting only humans. While the salivary glands (especially the parotid gland at the sides of the cheeks) are well known to be involved during a mumps infection, many other organ systems may also experience effects of the virus infection. There is no cure for mumps, but the illness is of short duration (seven to 10 days) and resolves spontaneously. Prior to the introduction of mumps immunization, the highest incidence of new cases of mumps was reported in the late winter to early spring.'  "
What is the history of mumps?,"'Medical historians believe that documentation of a clinical illness consistent with mumps dates back to Greco-Roman times. The first effective vaccine against mumps was introduced in 1948 and used from 1950-1978. Unfortunately, this vaccine strain had limited long-term immune memory effectiveness. The current strain used in the United States and worldwide provides 88% long-term immunity. The current childhood mumps immunization schedule recommends vaccination at 12-15 months old and a booster at 4-6 years of age. The mumps vaccine is commonly administered as part of a combination vaccine (MMR) also providing protection against ''measles'' and ''rubella'' (''German measles'').''Prior to the routine administration of the MMR vaccine, approximately 186,000 cases per year were documented in the United States. With immunization, that number has fallen to 2,015 cases in 2015. Recently, there have been outbreaks of mumps in Washington state.' "
What causes mumps? Is mumps contagious? How is mumps transmitted?,"'Mumps virus is a single strand of RNA housed inside a two-layered envelope that provides the virus its characteristic immune signature. Only one type of mumps virus has been demonstrated to exist (in contrast to the many virus types that can cause the ''common cold'').''Mumps is highly contagious on the order of magnitude of both ''influenza'' and ''rubella'' (German measles). It is, however, less contagious than measles and ''varicella'' (''chickenpox''). It is transmitted only from human to human. Mumps has a rapid spread among members living in close quarters. The virus most commonly is spread directly from one person to another via respiratory droplets expelled during ''sneezing'' or ''coughing''. Less frequently, the respiratory droplets may land on fomites (sheets, pillows, clothing) and then be transmitted via hand-to-mouth contact after touching such items. Animals cannot contract or spread mumps.' "
What is the incubation period for mumps?,'There is a 14-18-day period between contracting the mumps virus and onset of symptoms and signs. Viral shedding is short lived and a patient should be isolated from other susceptible individuals for the first five days following the onset of swelling of the salivary (parotid) glands.' 
What is the contagious period for mumps?,'The highest likelihood of spreading mumps covers the period of two days before the onset of symptoms and the first five days of parotid gland swelling and tenderness.' 
How long does mumps last?,'Routine cases of mumps last approximately seven to 10 days.' 
What are risk factors for contracting mumps?," Failure to vaccinate completely (two separate doses) with exposure to those with mumps Age: The highest risk of contracting mumps is to a child between 2-12 years of age. Season: Outbreaks of mumps were most likely during the winter/spring seasons. Travel to high-risk regions of the world: Africa, general Indian subcontinent region, and Southeast Asia. These areas have a very low rate of immunization. Weakening immune system: either due to diseases (for example, HIV/AIDS, cancer) or medication (oral steroid use for more than two weeks, chemotherapy) Born before 1956: Generally, these individuals are believed to have experienced mumps infection in childhood. However, if they did not, they are at risk for adult mumps disease. Adult mumps is associated with a more intense disease and higher rate of certain side effects (such as inflammation of testicles, or orchitis). A blood test may be obtained to determine immunity and is worthwhile if any doubt exists regarding prior mumps infection."
What does mumps look like?,'The unique physical exam findings seen in those with mumps is swelling and tenderness of one or both parotid glands on the sides of the face. The parotid glands are imbedded into the cheeks in front of the ear where a large set of sideburns would be. Less commonly affected are the salivary glands located under the lower jaw (mandible) or under the tongue (sublingual salivary glands).' 
What are the signs and symptoms of mumps in children and adults?,"'Nonspecific symptoms of low-grade ''fever'', ''headache'', muscle aches (''myalgia''), reduced appetite, and malaise occur during the first 48 hours of mumps infection. Parotid gland swelling characteristically is present on day three of illness. (The parotid gland is a salivary gland located anterior to the ear and above the angle of the jaw -- imagine a large set of sideburns.) The parotid gland is swollen and tender to touch, and referred ''pain'' to the ear may also occur. Parotid gland swelling may last up to 10 days, and adults generally experience worse symptoms than children. Approximately 95% of individuals who develop symptoms of mumps will experience tender inflammation of their parotid glands.''Interestingly about 15%-20% of mumps cases have no clinical evidence of infection, and 50% of patients will have only nonspecific respiratory symptoms and not the characteristic description above. Adults are more likely to experience such a subclinical or respiratory-only constellation of symptoms while children between 2-9 years of age are more likely to experience the classic presentation of mumps with parotid gland swelling.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose mumps?,"'The diagnosis of mumps is primarily one of clinical acumen. Laboratory studies are generally done to support the clinical impression. The purpose of these laboratory studies is to exclude other ''viruses'' that may give a similar clinical presentation as well as to exclude very infrequent similarly presenting parotid gland enlargement (for examples, ''salivary gland cancer'"", Sjögren's syndrome, IgG-4 related disease, ""'sarcoidosis'', side effects of ''thiazide diuretics'', etc.).' "
What is the medical treatment for mumps in adults and in children?,"'The mainstay of treatment (regardless of age range) is to provide comfort for this self-limited disease. Taking analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) and applying warm or cold packs to the swollen and inflamed salivary gland region may be helpful.'  "
What types of health care professionals treat mumps?,"'Most cases of mumps are not complicated and thus may be managed by health care professionals such as pediatricians, internists, or family practice doctors. An infectious-disease specialist may need to be consulted for unusual health circumstances or medically complicated patients.' "
What are complications of mumps?,"'There are four serious health complications of mumps: meningitis (infection of the spinal fluid which surrounds the brain and spinal cord), ''encephalitis'' (infection of the brain substance), deafness, and orchitis (infection of the testicle/testicles). All four complications may occur without the patient experiencing the classic involvement of the parotid gland.''Less frequent health complications of mumps infection include ''arthritis'', infection of the pancreas, infection of the ''myocardium'' (''heart'' muscle), and neurological conditions (for example, facial palsy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, etc.).' Meningitis: More than half of patients with mumps will have meningitis, which may occur during any period of the disease. Generally patients make a full recovery without permanent health side effects. Encephalitis: Until the 1960s, mumps was the primary cause of confirmed viral encephalitis in the United States. Since the successful introduction of a vaccination program, the incidence of mumps encephalitis has fallen to 0.5%. Fortunately, most patients recover completely without permanent medical side effects. Deafness: Preceding the mumps immunization program, permanent nerve damage resulting in deafness was not unusual. While occasionally bilateral, more commonly only one ear was affected. Orchitis: This complication was the most common side effect to postpubertal males who contracted mumps. Severe pain (often requiring hospitalization for pain management) was one-sided in most cases. Some affected testicles atrophied (decreased in size), and some demonstrated impaired fertility. The ""common knowledge"" of sterility was actually rare. Previous concerns regarding mumps orchitis and later development of testicular cancer have not been proven. (Ovarian involvement has been reported to occur in some postpubertal women.)"
Is it possible to prevent mumps? Is there a vaccine for mumps?,"'Prior to the start of mumps vaccination in 1948, outbreaks during the winter/spring would commonly affect young schoolchildren with secondary spread to other family members not yet immune. Until an effective vaccine program was introduced, isolation of the infected individual was the only public health control option. The current MMR strain used in the United States and other developed countries was licensed in 1967. Another strain is more commonly used in developing countries. Both ''strains'' provide approximately 88% immunity following the two-vaccination schedule detailed below. A single dose of mumps vaccine provides immunity to only 78% of recipients.''The Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends a combination vaccine (MMR) to children at 12 to 15 months of age with a booster dose at 4 to 6 years of age. During periods of possible mumps outbreaks, the booster dose may be administered after a minimum of 28 days following the initial immunization. The MMR immunization is designed to prevent measles, mumps, and ''rubella'' (German measles). Adults born after 1956 should receive at least one MMR vaccination. Those born prior to 1956 are generally found to have acquired natural immunity and no vaccination is necessary.''More common side effects of the MMR vaccine include stinging/burning at the injection site, mild fever, and mild skin ''rash''. The fever and skin ''rash'' most commonly develop five to 12 days postvaccination and occur more commonly after the first vaccination. Some recipients of the vaccine will note mild enlargement and tenderness of local (for example, neck) ''lymph nodes''. It should be noted that these relatively common side effects are considerably less severe than acquiring any of the three illnesses the MMR vaccine is designed to prevent. In extremely rare situations, more severe reactions affecting the nervous system, gastrointestinal system, and digestive organs, the skin, and others may occur.'  "
Who should not get vaccinated with the MMR?,"'A very small population should not receive the MMR vaccine. These include individuals with a compromised immune system (''HIV/AIDS'', ''cancer'', those receiving more than two continuous weeks of oral steroids) or who are ''allergic'' to any component of the vaccine, including gelatin or ''neomycin''. MMR ''vaccines'' are very unlikely to produce a severe reaction to those who are egg white allergic. Daily use of inhaled steroids (such as those used to control certain pulmonary diseases such as ''asthma'', ''COPD'', etc.) is not a contraindication to the MMR vaccine. Patients with a mild illness (for example, the ''common cold'') may safely receive the MMR vaccine. ''Conception'' should be avoided until at least 28 days following vaccination.''Multiple international studies have not demonstrated any causative relationship between administration of the MMR vaccine and the development of ''autism'', disproving previous erroneous theories.' "
What is the prognosis of a mumps infection?,"'Mumps is generally a benign self-limited disease that produces lifelong immunity. Severe medical side effects are extremely rare; more common complications (though still relatively rare) are listed above. Non-immune women who contract mumps during the ''first trimester'' of their ''pregnancy'' have an increased rate of ''miscarriage'', but infants carried to term have no higher risk for ''congenital malformations''.' "
Where can people find more information on mumps?,"'The CDC web site (''http://www.cdc.gov'') provides an excellent resource for the disease and vaccination program for mumps and many other common infectious diseases. In addition, the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (''http://www.aap.org'') also provides valuable information for the medically trained and nonmedically trained individual.' "
Can people get mumps twice?,"'Since there is only a single mumps virus in existence, lifelong immunity is generally acquired after a mumps infection. Ways to document mumps immunity include''Mumps immunity after complete vaccination is approximately 88%.

What is Munchausen syndrome?,"'Munchausen syndrome, referred to as a factitious disorder, is a mental condition in which sufferers cause or pretend to have physical or psychological symptoms in themselves. It is thought to be motivated only by a desire to assume the role of a sick person rather than by financial gain, improving his or her physical condition, avoiding responsibility, drug seeking, or some other benefit, as occurs in malingering. Research study results differ in terms of identifying groups that are most at risk for developing the disorder. Some statistics describe women with health training may be more susceptible to developing Munchausen syndrome, especially the physical symptoms thereof. However, other studies indicate that men and women develop Munchausen syndrome with equal frequency. Still other research describes unmarried middle-aged men who are estranged from their families as being the most at risk for developing this condition. While the condition may occur at any age, it seems to most often develop in late adolescence or early adulthood and is either preceded by or coexists with Munchausen syndrome by proxy.''Estimates of how often Munchausen syndrome occurs are a small percentage of the population of the United States, but it can be significantly higher in some subpopulations. For example, some people with ''fever'' of unknown origin have Munchausen syndrome. Some people who were previously diagnosed as having psychosis were found to have this disorder as well.''Even before having its current name, this condition has been described since at least biblical times. For example, sufferers of this syndrome during the Middle Ages went as far as scraping off their skin and putting leeches in their mouths to induce bleeding. This illness was named for Baron Karl Friedrich von Munchausen. He lived from 1720 to 1797, was born in Germany, joined the Russian military, and was known to tell fantastic stories about the battles he participated in. For example, he reportedly claimed to ride cannonballs and travel to the moon.'""In contrast to Munchausen syndrome, Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP) is a fabrication of sickness by a third person, usually a caretaker, which allows the third person to assume the sick role. The caretaker involved in the development of MSBP is usually the victim's mother. This illness involves psychological abuse and may also include physical abuse and medical neglect if symptoms are induced rather than just made up. Although both Munchausen syndrome and somatoform disorders can be characterized by physical complaints, Munchausen syndrome is different in that the complaints are consciously invented or caused by the sufferer him- or herself. For example, individuals with somatization disorder, conversion disorder, and people who are hypochondriacs are convinced that they really suffer from physical symptoms, have a deficit in movement or sensory function, or believe they are seriously ill, respectively."" "
What causes Munchausen syndrome?,"'Although there is no specific cause for Munchausen syndrome, like most other mental disorders, it is understood to be the result of a combination of biological vulnerabilities, ways of thinking, and social stressors. Little is known about the specific biological risk factors from which individuals with Munchausen syndrome are more likely to suffer. Psychologically, sufferers of this mental illness may have an increased need for control, an imbalance in the level of self-esteem (either low or excessively high), and a tendency to suffer from ''depression'', ''anxiety'', or substance-abuse disorders. Personality traits of individuals who have a history of feigning or inducing symptoms in themselves include some that are in common with ''borderline personality disorder'' (for example, if the person dissociates or has another disturbance in their identity/sense of self; has unstable relationships, recurrent instances of self-mutilation, and/or experiences recurrent thoughts or attempts at ''suicide'') or ''antisocial personality disorder'' (for example, a tendency to lie, disregard the safety of themselves or others, and to have little empathy for others).''Risk factors for people with Munchausen syndrome include:'   enduring a significant negative event (trauma) during their childhood (such as a serious illness of themselves, a close family member or friend), having a grudge against the medical profession or having been themselves the victim of neglect, physical or sexual abuse, or other forms of childhood maltreatment."
What are Munchausen syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'The specific signs and symptoms of Munchausen syndrome can be extremely varied, from ''heart symptoms'' like ''fainting'' and ''chest pain'', to ear problems seen by specialists in that area, to overtly psychiatric symptoms like ''hallucinations''. The most common physical symptoms tend to include:''Although the specific symptoms that the individual complains of are nearly limitless, sufferers may have in common a pattern of seeking treatment at several care providers and hospitals, seem to provide inconsistent medical history, have symptoms that are exaggerated, vague, and/or inconsistent with test results, have an illogical course to their illness, usually worsening, an unwillingness to allow current health care professionals to talk to family members or previous care providers, be excessively pleased to be subjected to multiple tests and procedures, as well as seeming happy to receive a medical diagnosis and have an excessive desire to receive medications. People with this condition may also engage in self-injury, altering test results, and have predictable relapses. Interestingly, the symptoms of Munchausen syndrome are very similar in children and adolescents as they are in adults.'  belly pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, trouble breathing, and blackouts."
How do health professionals diagnose Munchausen syndrome?,"'As occurs with some psychiatric conditions, there is ongoing debate about how to best understand and diagnose Munchausen syndrome. The diagnosis, now referred to as factitious disorder as indicated by the widely accepted criteria set by the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (''DSM'') requires that the sufferer exhibit the following:''There is no specific definitive test, like an X-ray or a blood test, which can assess that a person has Munchausen syndrome. Therefore, practitioners perform a mental-health interview that looks for the presence of the symptoms previously described. People with this condition may exhibit signs like having extensive knowledge of medical terminology, and they may have multiple surgical ''scars'"" despite having little objective evidence of a diagnosable physical condition. As with any mental-health evaluation, the professional will work toward ruling out other mental conditions and ensuring that the individual does not have a primary medical illness or from medical issues that may cause emotional problems. He or she will often inquire about when the person has most recently had a physical examination, comprehensive blood work, and any other medical tests that a professional deems necessary to ensure that the person does not have a true medical condition rather than or in addition to potentially feigning or causing symptoms. It is also important for the practitioner to review any available medical records and talking to other people who are in the person's life (like current or previous treating professionals, the spouse, or other family members) in order to explore the possibility that there is a pattern of the individual lying and/or faking symptoms in the past.""  Purposefully producing or pretending to have physical or mental-health signs or symptoms Presenting oneself as being sick, hurt, or impaired Engaging in the behaviors even when there are no obvious external motivators (like financial gain, avoiding legal problems, or improving physical well-being)"
What is the treatment for Munchausen syndrome?,"""Because of the chronic nature of the condition and the tendency of sufferers to flee from care, the treatment of Munchausen syndrome can be a challenge. No one method is consistently effective in managing this illness. Confronting victims of Munchausen syndrome tends to be ineffective. In fact, people with this condition are more likely to prematurely end treatment in response to being confronted, only to resume seeking unnecessary tests, procedures, and other treatments from a new health-care provider. Therefore, maintaining a delicate balance between providing the sufferer of Munchausen syndrome with empathetic professional support with preventing their receiving more unnecessary tests and procedures is key to treating victims of this condition. For example, showing empathy for the difficulties that may have contributed to the development of the disorder, while encouraging the sufferer to develop new ways of managing their feelings are important aspects of addressing Munchausen syndrome. In addition to trying to foster a supportive relationship with the individual with this illness, many health-care professionals will remain in close contact with the family of the sufferer in order to educate loved ones about the victim's behaviors and need for attention. The professional may also greatly contribute to the person's recovery by maintaining frequent communication with other healthcare professionals in educating those providers about this condition and preventing the continued performance of unnecessary tests and procedures.""'Treating Munchausen syndrome by proxy includes the involvement of child protective services to ensure the safety and well-being of the person, usually a child, in whom symptoms are being fabricated or induced, usually by a caretaker.' "
What is the prognosis for Munchausen syndrome?,"'Munchausen syndrome can have significant negative effects on the lives of those who suffer from it and on the community in general. This disorder is thought to result in about $40 million per year in unnecessary tests and other medical costs. The chronic nature and tendency for people with this illness to be at odds with the medical community puts sufferers at risk for multiple recurrences of symptoms. The associated high completed suicides at a rate of 30%-70% is another potential complication of this condition, and males tend to have worse outcomes than females. The outcomes for Munchausen syndrome by proxy tends to be quite poor if the victim of the abuse remains in the care of the perpetrator.''People with Munchausen syndrome who have no other psychiatric illness seem to have a better chance of full recovery than those who also suffer from another mental illness. However, when a person with another psychiatric disorder gets treatment for that problem, their symptoms of Munchausen syndrome often improve as well.' "
Is it possible to prevent Munchausen syndrome?,"'Prevention or early treatment of the factors that place people at risk for developing Munchausen syndrome are important ways to decrease the likelihood that the illness will develop in a specific individual. Therefore, prevention and early detection of ''child abuse'', education of parents, and other family members of the importance of seeing the needs for attention by seriously ill family members and for those close to them may significantly help prevent Munchausen syndrome from occurring. If signs of the illness are detected, the earlier they can be addressed, both following the onset of the illness and at the youngest age possible for the victim, the better the likely outcome.' "
What should you know about factitious disorders (Munchausen syndrome)?,"'Facticious disorder (previously called ""''Munchausen syndrome''"") is characterized by feigning or intentionally producing physical or emotional symptoms in another person in order to place that person in the sick role.''Symptoms a victim of ''factitious disorders'' signs and symptoms vary greatly; however, they may have symptoms that are more easily faked or induced, like suffocation, ''seizure'', bleeding or ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', or ''diarrhea'' that can be the result of poisoning presents with are highly variable,''How often factitious disorders occurs is likely very much underestimated, as evidenced by it often taking years to be discovered, even being completely missed in siblings of the victim that is eventually identified.''Males are victims of factitious disorders as often as females. Women are perpetrators of this disorder the vast majority of the time, theoretically because women remain the primary caretakers of children. Perpetrators of the syndrome are vulnerable to also suffering from ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and some personality disorders.''What causes factitious disorders?''While there is no specific cause for MSBP, perpetrators tend to have trouble forming a healthy attachment to their children, difficulty managing their anger and frustration, as well as having an ability to overcome the more natural tendency for caretakers to protect the children they care for. Perpetrators are also more likely to have a history of either losing a parent or being abused or neglected as a child.''Theories about what perpetrators gain from assuming the sick role through their child include seeking help, inducing symptoms, and being ""addicted"" to interactions with medical professionals.''Factitious disorders usually is diagnosed through intensive communication between medical, mental-health, and child-protection professionals, as well as review of all available medical records and interviewing family members, school personnel, and other pertinent community members. Sometimes, covertly videotaping the suspected abuser when with the child can be a useful additional diagnostic tool.''The treatment of MSBP involves close collaboration with professionals, family, and community members, intensive ''psychotherapy'' for the victim and the perpetrator, as well as protecting the child by either intensive supervision of the perpetrator, temporary or permanent removal of the child from the care of the abuser, and sometimes includes prosecution and incarceration of the perpetrator.'""If left untreated, MSBP can result in the child's death or growing up emotionally and/or medically disabled.""'Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSBP) is now classified as a somatic symptom and related disorder. It is referred to as factitious disorder that is imposed by one individual on another or factitious disorder by proxy.' "
What is factitious disorder by proxy?,"'Factitious disorders by proxy features a caretaker covertly abusing a child by faking or causing symptoms in the victim. Factitious disorder (previously called ''Munchhausen syndrome'') is a disorder that imposes one person another by proxy induced illness, or fabricated illness, and is a mental disorder that belongs to the group of mental illnesses called somatic symptom and related disorders. It is characterized by a feigning or intentional production of physical or mental-health symptoms in another person for the sole purpose of placing the other person in the sick role. While the reported frequency with which occurs seems low at one to three in 100,000, it is likely that the actual number of undiscovered cases is much higher. International statistics indicate that this condition is being increasingly assessed when it is severe, and as many as 1% of children with ''asthma'' have experienced at least once. Tends to affect males as victims as often as females. Affected individuals are usually 4 years old or younger and mothers are typically the perpetrators most of the time. The tendency toward maternal perpetrators may be more a result of women continuing to be the primary ''caregiver'' role than any gender-based predisposition to the disorder. Can take two years or more from the beginning or onset of symptoms to when it is diagnosed. Victims of are ominously found to have a sibling who is either deceased or to have had medical problems similar to the current victim of the disorder.''This disorder was named for Baron Karl Friedrich von Munchausen. He lived from 1720-1797, was born in Germany, joined the Russian military, and was known to tell fantastic tales about the battles he participated in against the Ottoman Turks. For example, he apparently told stories about riding cannonballs and traveling to the moon. As opposed to (factitious disorder imposed on another person), factitious disorder imposed on self is a ''mental illness'' in which what are initially thought to be symptoms of illness in the sufferer are in reality a fabrication of the illness by the sufferer rather than fabrication of illness by a third person. The motivation for factitious disorder imposed on self also tends to be an attempt by the sufferer to be seen as sick (assuming the sick or patient role). Emotional problems that tend to co-occur in people with include ''depression'', ''anxiety'', and some personality disorders like ''borderline personality disorder'' and sociopathy.'  "
What are factitious disorders by proxy symptoms and signs?,"'In the diagnostic manual that is recognized by most mental-health professionals, ''The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'', MSBP is classified as a somatic symptom and related disorder and is referred to as factitious disorder that is imposed by one individual on another.''Symptoms of factitious disorders include the sufferer being induced to experience physical or psychological symptoms or to have symptoms fabricated by another person, usually a caretaker. Specific symptoms in the victim are nearly as varied as the number of victims and perpetrators, with perhaps more emphasis on symptoms that are more feasibly manufactured or induced or are more difficult to measure objectively through laboratory tests (for example, stomach upset, other body aches and pains, and trouble ''breathing'' or sleeping).''Other more common symptoms presented by victims of factitious disorders include suffocation, induced ''seizures'', bleeding, or poisoning that presents as ''vomiting'' or ''diarrhea''. The abusive parent may describe symptoms in their child that do not exist. The symptoms may get worse only when the suspected caretaker is present or recently visited and may improve when the perpetrator is absent. Theories on what motivates the adult who assumes the sick role by causing a child to be sick might fall into one of three categories of motivation: help seeking, active induction of symptoms, and ""''addiction''"" to interactions with doctors. The help seeker is thought to be motivated to fabricate or cause their child\'s symptoms as a way of getting help for him or herself, assuming the sick role through their association with the supposedly sick child. This may be due to their feeling overwhelmed by their adult relationship, parenthood, or their own physical or emotional problems. The parent who actively induces symptoms of factitious disorders in the victim is thought to be seeking control of the medical professionals, as well as wanting recognition as an excellent parent by the professionals. Perpetrators who seem to be addicted to doctors are thought to be motivated to be seen as knowing better than the doctors.'  "
What causes factitious disorders by proxy? ,"'Although there is no specific cause for factitious disorders, like most other mental disorders, it is understood to be the result of a combination of biological vulnerabilities, ways of thinking, and social stressors (biopsychosocial model). Little is known about the specific biological vulnerabilities of individuals with factitious disorders. Psychologically, factitious disorders perpetrators tend to have trouble forming a healthy bond (attachment) with their children. Personality traits of individuals who have a history of inducing symptoms in the children they care for include trouble managing anger or frustration. Socially, those who feign or induce symptoms in others tend to have suffered from some sort of major negative event (''trauma'') during their own upbringing, including the death of a parent or other caretaker or having been themselves the victim of ''child abuse'' or neglect.' "
What are the treatment guidelines for factitious disorders?,"'As factitious disorders involves the caretaker covertly abusing a child by faking or causing symptoms in the child victim, a pediatrician who has experience and training in assessing and treating child abuse is often consulted and may be the primary professional working with the family. That professional will usually work with other professionals to review all medical records that have been kept and to communicate regularly about parents who are thought to seek excessive care since the abusive parent involved may have visited many different practitioners, even using different names in some cases, in an attempt to avoid the scrutiny that is likely harder to avoid if working with one medical practice, since one practitioner has more of an opportunity to get to know the perpetrator and the victim of factitious disorders over time. Covertly videotaping the interactions of a child with the suspected caretaker/abuser can be useful even when the victim is in a highly monitored setting like an intensive-care unit. While videotaping the child in the hospital may help in confirming or refuting the suspicion that the parent is engaged in harming the child, it is appropriately not seen as a substitute for the hard work of close monitoring, collaboration between all medical professionals, child protective services, mental-health professionals, and community members (for example, teachers, school counselors, clergy, and concerned extended family members) involved.'""As with other mental-health issues, there is no specific definitive test, such as a blood test, that can accurately assess that a person has factitious disorders . Therefore, practitioners conduct a mental-health interview that looks for the presence of the symptoms previously described. As with any mental-health assessment, the professional will usually work toward ruling out other mental and physical disorders and ensuring that the individual is not suffering from a primary medical problem or from medical issues that may have symptoms that cause emotional symptoms. He or she will therefore often inquire about when the child has most recently had a physical examination, comprehensive blood work, and any other tests that a medical professional deems necessary to ensure that he or she is not suffering from a true medical condition instead of or in addition to a caretaker potentially manufacturing symptoms in the child. Also of significant importance is the practitioner reviewing any available previous medical records and talking to other people who may be in the child's life (such as the other parent, if available, teachers, and counselors) in order to explore the possibility of a pattern of the caretaker in question making illness up before in this child or in a sibling or other child in their care.""'Due to the use of a mental-health interview in making the diagnosis, the potentially dire consequences to missing the diagnosis of factitious disorders or falsely assigning the diagnosis, as well as the fact that this disorder can be quite resistant to treatment, it is of great importance that the practitioner know to conduct a thorough assessment. It is equally important that the medical and mental-health professionals work together very closely and do not make assumptions about how much medical knowledge a parent should have or how they should behave in a situation involving the illness of their child. As only 50% of people with factitious disorders ever come to the attention of a psychiatrist, the importance of vigilant assessment and insisting on treatment when possible seems all the more important.' "
What is the treatment for factitious disorders by proxy?,"""The involvement of a comprehensive child-protective-services team is of paramount importance in the treatment of factitious disorders. As with any other child abuse, achieving and maintaining the safety of the child in the least restrictive setting is a key focus. If professionals, family members other than the perpetrator, and community support systems can successfully maintain the safety of the victim and any other child in the home, refraining from removing children from the home may be encouraged. However, if keeping the child in the same home is thought to put him or her at continued risk of harm, steps will likely be taken to move the victim and/or other children to a safer placement. With effective treatment progress by the victim and the abuser, professionals may consider slowly reintroducing the child to the home while closely monitoring the child's safety. In the event that such reintegration is not possible, the child might be permanently placed outside the home of the perpetrator. In severe cases, professionals may seek the prosecution and incarceration of the perpetrator and permanently prevent the abuser's access to the victim.""'In working with the child, therapists often teach the victim techniques for changing dysfunctional ways of behaving while helping the child understand the underlying feelings and motivations for those behaviors. While psychiatric medications like ''antidepressant'', anti-anxiety, mood stabilizer, and antipsychotic medications may be used to alleviate specific symptoms for the perpetrator or victim, medication by no means cures the illness completely.'""Individual psychotherapy for both the perpetrator of factitious disorders and the victim, as well as family therapy for members of the household involved are often incorporated into the treatment program. At the same time, the ongoing use of medical services is closely monitored by medical, mental-health, and child-protection professionals. Sometimes, the primary-care doctor (for example, pediatrician) will be notified by the insurance company of future use of medical services by the factitious disorders victim or the victim's siblings. The professional might also be notified when the child is absent from school. Access to such information is either granted through child protective services or by a parent. School officials may agree not to excuse an absence unless approved by the primary-care physician."" "
What if factitious disorders aren't treated? ,"'If left untreated, the prognosis of factitious disorders can be quite ominous. It can result in child victims who grow up to be medically, emotionally, or otherwise functionally disabled adults. Research shows that people who were the victim of MSBP as children are more likely to develop weight problems (including ''anorexia'' or ''obesity'') and ''chronic pain'' as adults. Emotional complications can include ''depression'', anxiety, anger problems, ''posttraumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD''), and ''mood swings''. People with this disorder are prone to having trouble completing their education and either avoiding or excessively visiting medical practitioners. It can even be fatal in more than 5% of cases, and more than 7% may have long-term or permanent injury as a result. Survivors of this disorder are sadly at higher risk of becoming perpetrators of this and other forms of child abuse as adults.' "
Is it possible to prevent factitious disorders by proxy?,"'Prevention'' strategies for factitious disorders currently tend to focus on avoiding continued abuse once factitious disorders is identified. Given the low frequency with which this disorder is diagnosed, some researchers propose that studies of this disorder would be better focused on its early identification and treatment rather than on prevention.'

What is a heart murmur?,"'A heart murmur is a continuous sound that is audible with a common stethoscope, produced when blood passes through particular areas of the heart. The heart has four chambers, two atria (singular = ''atrium'') and two ventricles separated by a ""skeleton"" of cartilage that separates each chamber. This skeleton is made up of the atrial septum, the ventricular septum, and four valves (aortic, pulmonary, mitral, and tricuspid) that direct blood flow in a specific route within the heart allowing the most efficient use of each heartbeat to pump blood to the rest of the body.''The sound of a murmur is generated when blood flow within the heart is not smooth and turbulence occurs. Using a stethoscope, a health care practitioner may be able to hear a heart murmur during the physical examination. Not all heart murmurs are abnormal or dangerous and may be innocent, but if one is present it may potentially signal a structural abnormality of the heart.'   Each heartbeat has two phases, systole when the heart pumps and diastole when the heart chambers fill with blood. Blood enters the right atrium from the body via the vena cava. It travels through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. A systolic heartbeat sends the blood through the pulmonary valve, which separates the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, to the lung. In the lung, oxygen is delivered to red blood cells and carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, is removed. The oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium where it travels through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. The systolic heartbeat also causes the left side of the heart to contract and send the blood through the aortic valve that separates the left ventricle and the aorta. Blood passes through the aorta to the body delivering oxygen to the body's tissues."
"What are the signs and symptoms of heart murmurs in infants, children, and adults?","""A heart murmur itself does not causes symptoms. Generally, it doesn't cause symptoms, and can't be heard by the person with the murmur. The underlying structural issue of the heart may cause problems; however, any heart murmurs are innocent and of no consequence.""'Newborns with congenital ''heart disease'' may have symptoms and signs of a heart murmur who have difficulty ''breathing'' and who are cyanotic. The heart cannot circulate blood and oxygen from the ''lungs'' to the body. Some infants with heart issues may have:'   Difficulty feeding Difficulty developing, and gaining weight appropriately. Most heart murmurs in well-developed children are harmless. In adults, heart abnormalities may cause chest pain, and heart failure with symptoms of shortness of breath and swelling of the extremities. Palpitations or a sensation of an irregular heartbeat are occasionally seen in people with with heart valve abnormalities."
"What causes heart murmurs in infants, children, and adults?","'Many heart murmurs are harmless and referred to as innocent or functional. They are caused when blood rushes through the heart quickly during normal function while no ''heart disease'' may exist. There may be an underlying medical condition that can lead to an innocent murmur. These may include situations where the heart beats more quickly such as ''fever'', ''anemia'', ''hyperthyroidism'', and ''pregnancy''.''Congenital heart murmurs are heard in the ''newborn''. They may be due to abnormalities in the valves, septae, or arteries, and veins that carry blood to and from the heart. In some complicated ''heart disease'' conditions there may be a combination of all three. Many congenital heart murmurs resolve spontaneously without medical intervention while others require surgical operations for repair.''Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) may cause a heart murmur in a ''newborn'"". Prior to birth, the aorta and pulmonary artery are connected by a small artery, the ductus arteriosus, to complete fetal blood circulation since oxygen is supplied to the fetus by the placenta. Shortly after birth, this artery is supposed to close. If other congenital heart abnormalities exist, the ductus may remain open to help maintain some blood circulation. Sometimes, when no congenital abnormalities exist, the ductus doesn't completely close and a murmur may exist. Many times the patent ductus arteriosus closes by itself over time. Occasionally, medications or surgery may be required to close off a patent ductus arteriosus.""'Abnormalities of the valves of the heart may cause a heart murmur. Any of the heart valves may be affected and clinical symptoms depend upon the severity of the valve damage and whether the blood flow pattern within the heart is maintained. Each valve problem often leads to a specific character and timing of heart murmur.''Holes in the walls of the heart (the septum that divides the heart chambers) can be the source of a heart murmur. Atrial septal defect (''ASD'') describes a hole in the wall that separates the collecting chamber of the heart while a ''ventricular septal defect'' (VSD) affects the wall dividing the pumping chamber.'   Valve stenosis is narrowing of a heart valve. This often occurs over time as the valve scars due to injury and scarring from infection such as in rheumatic fever or from a congenital birth defect. Calcification of a valve may also result in stenosis. This causes the heart muscle to work harder to push blood through the narrowed opening. Like any muscle that has to work harder, heart muscle will hypertrophy and thicken. Heart failure, where fluid builds up in the lungs and extremeties, may be a complication. Valve regurgitation (or insufficiency) is a valve that leaks causing blood to pass backward against the normal blood flow pattern in the heart. A valve may have both stenosis and regurgitation. Valve sclerosis is the mild narrowing and stiffening of the valve (most often seen in the aortic valve) due to aging. It is associated with atherosclerotic heart disease. Valve prolapse is a bowing of a valve that causes some leaking and most often involves the mitral valve. Endocarditis is an infection of the lining of the heart that may involve and destroy a heart valve. The source of the infection is usually elsewhere in the body and it travels via the bloodstream to infect the heart. There may be a previous underlying heart condition."
"What are the risk factors for heart murmur in infants, children, and adults?","'A heart murmur is a physical finding of an underlying heart condition and in many instances may be of no consequence. The risk factor for developing a particular murmur is the risk factor for the underlying condition.' Congenital heart disease tends to have a familial basis, meaning that there may be a genetic predisposition for a baby to develop a structurally abnormal heart. Some valvular diseases are present at birth, but take a lifetime to develop symptoms. For example, the aortic valve is supposed to have three leaflets that come together; some people are born with a valve that has only two leaflets (bicuspid). Over time, a two-leafed valve may be more prone to calcification and narrowing. Symptoms may only be seen later in life. Some valve diseases are due to infection (endocarditis). Historically, rheumatic fever described heart valve inflammation as a consequence of a bacterial streptococcus infection. With present day screening for strep infections and the appropriate use of antibiotics, this rheumatic heart disease is rare. Endocarditis may be seen as a complication of intravenous drug abuse. Other risk factors for heart valve abnormalities include atherosclerotic heart disease, heart attack, aortic aneurysm, and connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Marfan syndrome. Each condition affects the valves in a different way causing them to malfunction and develop the physical finding of a heart murmur."
"What exams, tests, and imaging studies diagnose heart murmurs in infants, children, and adults?","'A heart murmur is usually diagnosed during a physical examination by the health care practitioner while he or she listens to heart sounds with a stethoscope.''Evaluation of the heart begins with questions relating to ''heart function''. In an adult, some questions may include asking about chest ''pain'' or pressure, ''shortness of breath'' with exertion or at rest, and swelling of the legs. In an infant, the symptoms may include poor sucking or eating, poor ''weight gain'' and growth, or episodes of ''cyanosis'' (''turning blue'').''Physical examination includes assessing skin color, feeling and assessing pulses, evaluating the legs looking for swelling and ''edema'', and listening to the lungs for signs of fluid buildup.''Heart evaluation includes assessing the rate and rhythm of the heart. Is it too fast, too slow, regular, or irregular? The front of the chest can be palpated; a hand is placed on the area overlying the heart trying to feel for a vibration (thrill) that can occur with an especially significant heart murmur.''Listening to the heart with the stethoscope begins with assessing basic first and second heart sounds, S1 and S2, which sound like ""lub-dub."" Potential extra heart sounds are referred to as S3 and S4. Should a heart murmur be heard, the health care practitioner will try to determine whether the sound is coming from an abnormal valve or a defect in the atrial or ventricular septum. The murmur is described whether it is heard in systole (when the heart is pumping) or diastole (when the heart is filling). The location on the chest and where the sound radiates is important in determining where the murmur originates. The intensity of the murmur is usually graded on a 6 point scale are:''Murmurs graded 4, 5, and 6 have an associated vibration (thrill) felt when the chest wall is palpated:''Many murmurs are diagnosed as normal (physiologic) based upon physical examination and require no further evaluation.''Initial testing may include an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') which can help evaluate the heart rate and rhythm, electrical conduction within the heart, and whether hypertrophy or excess heart muscle has developed. A ''chest X-ray'' may help evaluate heart size and shape and may find excess ''fluid in the lungs'' due to abnormal heart function.''If further testing is required, often an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound'') examination of the heart is helpful in visualizing the structures and functions of the heart.

"When should in infants, child, and adults seek medical care for a heart murmur?"," Generally, a heart murmur does not cause symptoms. It is the underlying heart function issues that often cause people to seek medical help. Chest pain and shortness of breath should always be taken seriously and not ignored. Medical help should be accessed immediately if a person has heart or lung concerns."
"Can heart murmurs be prevented in infants, children, and adults?","'It is important to remember that a heart murmur is a physical finding and is not a disease or structural heart problem. Rather it is the sound that is made because of a potential blood flow problem within the heart. Maintaining a life-long heart-healthy lifestyle may help prevent some heart valve issues. These lifestyle opportunities include keeping ''blood pressure'', ''cholesterol'', and ''diabetes'' under control. It is a positive choice not to smoke. Regular ''exercise'' and ''weight management'' also contribute to a healthy heart.''Historically, ''rheumatic fever'' was a complication of ''strep throat'' (streptococcal ''pharyngitis''). This could cause heart valve damage and the development of a heart murmur. With the advent of good screening tests for ''strep'' infections and the appropriate use of antibiotics, ''rheumatic fever'' is a rarely diagnosed condition.' "
What is a heart murmur?,"'A heart murmur is a continuous sound that is audible with a common stethoscope, produced when blood passes through particular areas of the heart. The heart has four chambers, two atria (singular = ''atrium'') and two ventricles separated by a ""skeleton"" of cartilage that separates each chamber. This skeleton is made up of the atrial septum, the ventricular septum, and four valves (aortic, pulmonary, mitral, and tricuspid) that direct blood flow in a specific route within the heart allowing the most efficient use of each heartbeat to pump blood to the rest of the body.''The sound of a murmur is generated when blood flow within the heart is not smooth and turbulence occurs. Using a stethoscope, a health care practitioner may be able to hear a heart murmur during the physical examination. Not all heart murmurs are abnormal or dangerous and may be innocent, but if one is present it may potentially signal a structural abnormality of the heart.'   Each heartbeat has two phases, systole when the heart pumps and diastole when the heart chambers fill with blood. Blood enters the right atrium from the body via the vena cava. It travels through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. A systolic heartbeat sends the blood through the pulmonary valve, which separates the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, to the lung. In the lung, oxygen is delivered to red blood cells and carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, is removed. The oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium where it travels through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. The systolic heartbeat also causes the left side of the heart to contract and send the blood through the aortic valve that separates the left ventricle and the aorta. Blood passes through the aorta to the body delivering oxygen to the body's tissues."
"What are the signs and symptoms of heart murmurs in infants, children, and adults?","""A heart murmur itself does not causes symptoms. Generally, it doesn't cause symptoms, and can't be heard by the person with the murmur. The underlying structural issue of the heart may cause problems; however, any heart murmurs are innocent and of no consequence.""'Newborns with congenital ''heart disease'' may have symptoms and signs of a heart murmur who have difficulty ''breathing'' and who are cyanotic. The heart cannot circulate blood and oxygen from the ''lungs'' to the body. Some infants with heart issues may have:'   Difficulty feeding Difficulty developing, and gaining weight appropriately. Most heart murmurs in well-developed children are harmless. In adults, heart abnormalities may cause chest pain, and heart failure with symptoms of shortness of breath and swelling of the extremities. Palpitations or a sensation of an irregular heartbeat are occasionally seen in people with with heart valve abnormalities."
"What causes heart murmurs in infants, children, and adults?","'Many heart murmurs are harmless and referred to as innocent or functional. They are caused when blood rushes through the heart quickly during normal function while no ''heart disease'' may exist. There may be an underlying medical condition that can lead to an innocent murmur. These may include situations where the heart beats more quickly such as ''fever'', ''anemia'', ''hyperthyroidism'', and ''pregnancy''.''Congenital heart murmurs are heard in the ''newborn''. They may be due to abnormalities in the valves, septae, or arteries, and veins that carry blood to and from the heart. In some complicated ''heart disease'' conditions there may be a combination of all three. Many congenital heart murmurs resolve spontaneously without medical intervention while others require surgical operations for repair.''Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) may cause a heart murmur in a ''newborn'"". Prior to birth, the aorta and pulmonary artery are connected by a small artery, the ductus arteriosus, to complete fetal blood circulation since oxygen is supplied to the fetus by the placenta. Shortly after birth, this artery is supposed to close. If other congenital heart abnormalities exist, the ductus may remain open to help maintain some blood circulation. Sometimes, when no congenital abnormalities exist, the ductus doesn't completely close and a murmur may exist. Many times the patent ductus arteriosus closes by itself over time. Occasionally, medications or surgery may be required to close off a patent ductus arteriosus.""'Abnormalities of the valves of the heart may cause a heart murmur. Any of the heart valves may be affected and clinical symptoms depend upon the severity of the valve damage and whether the blood flow pattern within the heart is maintained. Each valve problem often leads to a specific character and timing of heart murmur.''Holes in the walls of the heart (the septum that divides the heart chambers) can be the source of a heart murmur. Atrial septal defect (''ASD'') describes a hole in the wall that separates the collecting chamber of the heart while a ''ventricular septal defect'' (VSD) affects the wall dividing the pumping chamber.'   Valve stenosis is narrowing of a heart valve. This often occurs over time as the valve scars due to injury and scarring from infection such as in rheumatic fever or from a congenital birth defect. Calcification of a valve may also result in stenosis. This causes the heart muscle to work harder to push blood through the narrowed opening. Like any muscle that has to work harder, heart muscle will hypertrophy and thicken. Heart failure, where fluid builds up in the lungs and extremeties, may be a complication. Valve regurgitation (or insufficiency) is a valve that leaks causing blood to pass backward against the normal blood flow pattern in the heart. A valve may have both stenosis and regurgitation. Valve sclerosis is the mild narrowing and stiffening of the valve (most often seen in the aortic valve) due to aging. It is associated with atherosclerotic heart disease. Valve prolapse is a bowing of a valve that causes some leaking and most often involves the mitral valve. Endocarditis is an infection of the lining of the heart that may involve and destroy a heart valve. The source of the infection is usually elsewhere in the body and it travels via the bloodstream to infect the heart. There may be a previous underlying heart condition."
"What are the risk factors for heart murmur in infants, children, and adults?","'A heart murmur is a physical finding of an underlying heart condition and in many instances may be of no consequence. The risk factor for developing a particular murmur is the risk factor for the underlying condition.' Congenital heart disease tends to have a familial basis, meaning that there may be a genetic predisposition for a baby to develop a structurally abnormal heart. Some valvular diseases are present at birth, but take a lifetime to develop symptoms. For example, the aortic valve is supposed to have three leaflets that come together; some people are born with a valve that has only two leaflets (bicuspid). Over time, a two-leafed valve may be more prone to calcification and narrowing. Symptoms may only be seen later in life. Some valve diseases are due to infection (endocarditis). Historically, rheumatic fever described heart valve inflammation as a consequence of a bacterial streptococcus infection. With present day screening for strep infections and the appropriate use of antibiotics, this rheumatic heart disease is rare. Endocarditis may be seen as a complication of intravenous drug abuse. Other risk factors for heart valve abnormalities include atherosclerotic heart disease, heart attack, aortic aneurysm, and connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Marfan syndrome. Each condition affects the valves in a different way causing them to malfunction and develop the physical finding of a heart murmur."
"What exams, tests, and imaging studies diagnose heart murmurs in infants, children, and adults?","'A heart murmur is usually diagnosed during a physical examination by the health care practitioner while he or she listens to heart sounds with a stethoscope.''Evaluation of the heart begins with questions relating to ''heart function''. In an adult, some questions may include asking about chest ''pain'' or pressure, ''shortness of breath'' with exertion or at rest, and swelling of the legs. In an infant, the symptoms may include poor sucking or eating, poor ''weight gain'' and growth, or episodes of ''cyanosis'' (''turning blue'').''Physical examination includes assessing skin color, feeling and assessing pulses, evaluating the legs looking for swelling and ''edema'', and listening to the lungs for signs of fluid buildup.''Heart evaluation includes assessing the rate and rhythm of the heart. Is it too fast, too slow, regular, or irregular? The front of the chest can be palpated; a hand is placed on the area overlying the heart trying to feel for a vibration (thrill) that can occur with an especially significant heart murmur.''Listening to the heart with the stethoscope begins with assessing basic first and second heart sounds, S1 and S2, which sound like ""lub-dub."" Potential extra heart sounds are referred to as S3 and S4. Should a heart murmur be heard, the health care practitioner will try to determine whether the sound is coming from an abnormal valve or a defect in the atrial or ventricular septum. The murmur is described whether it is heard in systole (when the heart is pumping) or diastole (when the heart is filling). The location on the chest and where the sound radiates is important in determining where the murmur originates. The intensity of the murmur is usually graded on a 6 point scale are:''Murmurs graded 4, 5, and 6 have an associated vibration (thrill) felt when the chest wall is palpated:''Many murmurs are diagnosed as normal (physiologic) based upon physical examination and require no further evaluation.''Initial testing may include an ''electrocardiogram'' (''EKG'') which can help evaluate the heart rate and rhythm, electrical conduction within the heart, and whether hypertrophy or excess heart muscle has developed. A ''chest X-ray'' may help evaluate heart size and shape and may find excess ''fluid in the lungs'' due to abnormal heart function.''If further testing is required, often an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound'') examination of the heart is helpful in visualizing the structures and functions of the heart. The ''echocardiogram'' can help to determine the specific diagnosis when a heart murmur is present.

What are muscle cramps?,"'A muscle cramp is an involuntarily and forcibly contracted muscle that does not relax. When we use the muscles that can be controlled voluntarily, such as those of our arms and legs, they alternately contract and relax as we move our limbs. Muscles that support our head, neck, and trunk contract similarly in a synchronized fashion to maintain our posture. A muscle (or even a few fibers of a muscle) that involuntarily (without consciously willing it) contracts is in a ""spasm."" If the spasm is forceful and sustained, it becomes a cramp. Muscle cramps often cause a visible or palpable hardening of the involved muscle.''Muscle cramps can last anywhere from a few seconds to a quarter of an hour or occasionally longer. It is not uncommon for a cramp to recur multiple times until it finally resolves. The cramp may involve a part of a muscle, the entire muscle, or several muscles that usually act together, such as those that flex adjacent fingers. Some cramps involve the simultaneous contraction of muscles that ordinarily move body parts in opposite directions.''Muscle cramps are extremely common. Almost everyone (one estimate is about 95%) experiences a cramp at some time in their life. Muscle cramps are common in adults and become increasingly frequent with ''aging''. However, children also experience cramps of muscles.''Any of the muscles that are under our voluntary control (skeletal muscles) can cramp. Cramps of the extremities, especially the legs and feet\xa0(including ''nocturnal'' leg cramps),\xa0and most particularly the calf (the classic ""charley horse""), are very common. Involuntary muscles of the various organs (uterus, blood vessel wall, bowels, bile and urine passages, bronchial tree, etc.) are also subject to cramps. Cramps of the involuntary muscles will not be further considered in this review. This article focuses on cramps of skeletal muscle.' "
What are the types and causes of muscle cramps?,"'Skeletal muscle cramps can be categorized into four major types. These include ""true"" cramps, tetany, contractures, and dystonic cramps. Cramps are categorized according to their different causes and the muscle groups they affect.'  "
Types of muscle cramps: True cramps,"'True cramps involve part or all of a single muscle or a group of muscles that generally act together, such as the muscles that flex several adjacent fingers or the leg muscles. Most authorities agree that true cramps are caused by hyperexcitability of the nerves that stimulate the muscles. They are overwhelmingly the most common type of skeletal muscle cramps. True cramps can occur in a variety of circumstances as follows.' "
Injury and vigorous activity muscle cramps,"'Injury'': Persistent ''muscle spasm'' may occur as a protective mechanism following an injury, such as a ''broken bone''. In this instance, the spasm tends to minimize movement and stabilize the area of injury. Injury of the muscle alone may cause the muscle to spasm.''Vigorous activity'': True cramps are commonly associated with the vigorous use of muscles and muscle ''fatigue'' (in sports or with unaccustomed activities). Such cramps may come during the activity or later, sometimes many hours later. Likewise, muscle ''fatigue'' from sitting or lying for an extended period in an awkward position or any repetitive use can cause cramps. Older adults are at risk for cramps when performing vigorous or strenuous physical activities.' "
Rest cramps and dehydration muscle cramps,"'Rest cramps'': Cramps at rest are very common, especially in older adults, but may be experienced at any age, including childhood. Rest muscle cramps often occur at night. While not life threatening, night cramps (commonly known as nocturnal cramps) can be painful, disruptive of ''sleep'', and they can recur frequently (that is, many times a night, and/or many nights each week). The actual cause of night cramps is unknown. Sometimes, such cramps are initiated by making a movement that shortens the muscle. An example is pointing the toe down while lying in bed, which shortens the calf muscle of the leg, a common site of muscle cramps.''Dehydration'': Sports and other vigorous activities, including activities of endurance athletes, can cause excessive fluid loss from ''perspiration''. This kind of dehydration increases the likelihood of true cramps. These cramps are more likely to occur in warm weather and can be an early sign of ''heat stroke''. Chronic volume depletion of body fluids from diuretics (medicine that promote urination) and poor fluid intake both lead to dehydration and may act similarly to predispose to cramps, especially in older people. Sodium depletion has also been associated with cramps. Loss of sodium, the most abundant chemical constituent of body fluids outside the cell, is usually a function of dehydration.' "
"Body fluid shifts, low blood calcium, and low potassium muscle cramps","'Body fluid shifts'': True cramps also may be experienced in other conditions that feature an unusual distribution of body fluids. An example is ''cirrhosis'' of the ''liver'', which leads to the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal ''cavity'' (''ascites''). Similarly, cramps are a relatively frequent complication of the rapid body fluid changes that occur during ''dialysis'' for ''kidney failure''.''Low blood calcium or magnesium'': Low blood levels of either calcium or magnesium directly increase the excitability of both the nerve endings and the muscles they stimulate. This may be a predisposing factor for the spontaneous true cramps experienced by many older adults, as well as for those muscle cramps that are commonly noted during ''pregnancy''. Low levels of calcium and magnesium are common in ''pregnant'' women unless these ''minerals'' are supplemented in the ''diet''. Cramps are seen in any circumstance that decreases the availability of calcium or magnesium in body fluids, such as taking diuretics, ''hyperventilation'' (overbreathing), excessive ''vomiting'', inadequate calcium and/or magnesium in the ''diet'', inadequate calcium absorption due to ''vitamin D deficiency'', poor function of the parathyroid glands (tiny glands in the neck that regulate calcium balance), and other conditions.''Low potassium'': Low potassium blood levels occasionally cause muscle cramps, although it is more common for low potassium to be associated with muscle ''weakness''.' "
Types of muscle cramps - Tetany,"'In tetany, all of the nerve cells in the body are activated, which then stimulate the muscles. This reaction causes spasms or cramps throughout the body.  The name tetany is derived from the effect of the ''tetanus'' toxin on the nerves. However, the name is now commonly applied to muscle cramping from other conditions, such as low blood levels of calcium and magnesium.  Low calcium and low magnesium, which increase the activity of nerve tissue nonspecifically, also can produce tetanic cramps.  Often, such cramps are accompanied by evidence of ''hyperactivity'' of other nerve functions in addition to muscle stimulation.  For instance, low blood calcium  not only causes spasm of the muscles of the hands and wrists, but it can also cause a sensation of numbness and tingling around the mouth and other areas.''Sometimes, tetanic cramps are indistinguishable from true cramps. The accompanying changes of sensation or other nerve functions that occurs with tetany may not be apparent because the cramp ''pain'' is masking or distracting from it. ' "
Types of muscle cramps - Dystonic cramps,"""The final category is dystonic cramps, in which muscles that are not needed for the intended movement are stimulated to contract. Muscles that are affected by this type of cramping include those that ordinarily work in the opposite direction of the intended movement, and/or others that exaggerate the movement.  Some dystonic cramps usually affect small groups of muscles (eyelids, jaws, neck, larynx, etc.).  The hands and arms may be affected during the performance of repetitive activities such as those associated with handwriting (writer's cramp), typing, playing certain musical instruments, and many others.  Each of these repetitive activities may also produce true cramps from muscle ""'fatigue''. Dystonic cramps are not as common as true cramps. ' "
Q: What can mimic a muscle cramp?,"'Answer: A contracture is a condition that may mimic a muscle cramp.'""A contracture is a scarring of the soft tissues that muscle movements normally affect. When a contracture is present, the tissue that is involved cannot move completely, whether the corresponding muscle is activated or relaxed. This is because the scarred tissue cannot move in response to muscle movements. This leads to a fixed body part with loss of full range of motion. The most common type of contracture occurs in the palm of the hand and affects the tendons that normally cause the fingers to close with gripping. Most commonly, this form of contracture affects the ring finger. This contracture is known as a Dupuytren's contracture of the hand."" "
Do all muscle cramps fit into the above categories?,"""No. Not all cramps are readily categorized in the preceding manner since these categories best apply to cramps that make up an individual's major muscle problem. Many cramps are a relatively minor part of nerve and muscle diseases; other muscle symptoms are usually more prominent in these diseases. Some examples include ""'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'"" (Lou Gehrig's disease) with weakness and muscle wasting; ""'radiculopathy'' (''spinal nerve'' irritation or compression from various causes) with ''pain'', distortion or loss of sensation, and/or weakness; diseases of the peripheral nerves, such as ''diabetic neuropathy'', with distorted and diminished sensation and weakness; and a number of primarily dystonic muscle diseases. ' "
Can medications cause muscle cramps?,"'Numerous medicines can cause cramps. Potent diuretic medications, such as ''furosemide'' (''Lasix''), or the vigorous removal of body fluids, even with less potent diuretics, can induce cramps by depleting body fluid and sodium.  Simultaneously, diuretics often cause the loss of potassium, calcium, and magnesium, which can also cause cramps.''Medications such as ''donepezil'' (''Aricept'', used for  '""Alzheimer's""' disease) and neostigmine (Prostigmine and others, used for ''myasthenia gravis'') as well as  ''raloxifene'' (''Evista'', used to prevent  ''osteoporosis'' in ''postmenopausal'' women) can cause cramps.  ''Tolcapone'' (''Tasmar'',  used for '""Parkinson's""' disease) reportedly causes muscle cramps in at least 10% of patients.  True cramps have been reported with ''nifedipine'' (''Procardia'' and others, used for ''angina'', ''high blood pressure'' and other conditions) and the ''asthma'' ''drugs'' ''terbutaline'' (Brethine) and ''albuterol'' (Proventil, Ventolin, and others). Some medicines used to lower ''cholesterol'', such as ''lovastatin'' (''Mevacor''), can also lead to cramps.''Cramps are sometimes noted in addicted individuals during withdrawal from medications and substances that have sedative effects, including ''alcohol'', ''barbiturates'' and other ''sedatives'', anti-''anxiety'' agents such as ''benzodiazepines'' (for example, ''diazepam'' [''Valium''] and ''alprazolam'' [''Xanax'']), narcotics, and other drugs. ' "
Can vitamin deficiencies cause muscle cramps?,"'Several vitamin deficiency states may directly or indirectly lead to muscle cramps. These include deficiencies of ''thiamine'' (B1), pantothenic acid (B5), and ''pyridoxine'' (B6). The precise role of deficiency of these ''vitamins'' in causing cramps is unknown.'  "
Can poor circulation cause muscle cramps?,"'Poor circulation to the leg muscles, which results in inadequate oxygen to the muscle tissue, can cause severe pain in the leg muscle (sometimes known as ''claudication'' pain or ''intermittent claudication'') that occurs with ''walking'' or ''exercise'"". This commonly occurs in the calf muscles. While the pain feels virtually identical to that of a severely cramped muscle, the pain does not seem to be a result of the actual muscle cramping. This pain may be due to accumulation of lactic acid and other chemicals in the muscle tissues. It's important to see your doctor if you have pain like this."" "
What are the symptoms of common muscle cramps? How muscle cramps diagnosed?,"'Characteristically, a cramp is painful, often severely so. Usually, the sufferer must stop whatever activity is under way and seek relief from the cramp; the person is unable to use the affected muscle while it is cramping. Severe cramps may be associated with soreness and swelling, which can occasionally persist up to several days after the cramp has subsided. At the time of cramping, the knotted muscle will bulge, feel very firm, and may be tender.''There are no special tests for cramps. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of muscle cramps is relatively easy. Most people know what cramps are and when they have one. If present during a cramp, the doctor, or any other bystander, can feel the tense, firm bulge of the cramped muscle.' "
What types of doctors treat muscle cramps?,"'Because there are so many different causes and types of muscle cramps, many different medical specialists may be involved in their treatment. Most commonly, patients would consult their primary-care provider, including specialists in internal medicine or family medicine. If the cramps are the result of a sudden injury or illness, emergency-medicine specialists would treat the patient. Cramps due to specific medical conditions may be treated by different specialists, including neurologists, orthopedists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, cardiologists, sports-medicine specialists, physiatrists, or surgeons. ' "
What are treatments and home remedies for skeletal muscle cramps?,"""Most cramps can be stopped if the muscle can be stretched. For many cramps of the feet and legs, this stretching can often be accomplished by standing up and walking around. For a calf muscle cramp, the person can stand about 2 to 2.5 feet from a wall (possibly farther for a tall person) and lean into the wall to place the forearms against the wall with the knees and back straight and the heels in contact with the floor. (It is best to learn this maneuver at a time when you don't have the cramp.) Another technique involves flexing the ankle by pulling the toes up toward the head while still lying in bed with the leg as straight as possible. For writer's cramp (contractures in the hand), pressing the hand on a wall with the fingers facing down will stretch the cramping finger flexor muscles.""'Gently massaging the muscle will often help it to relax, as will applying warmth from a heating pad or hot soak. If the cramp is associated with fluid loss, as is often the case with vigorous physical activity, fluid and ''electrolyte'' (especially sodium and potassium) replacement is essential. Medicines generally are not needed to treat an ordinary cramp that is active since most cramps subside spontaneously before enough medicine would be absorbed to even have an effect.'  "
Medical treatment for muscle cramps,"'Muscle relaxant medications may be used over the short-term in certain situations to relax muscle cramps due to an injury or other temporary event. These medications include ''cyclobenzaprine'' (''Flexeril''), ''orphenadrine'' (''Norflex''), and ''baclofen'' (''Lioresal'').''In recent years, injections of therapeutic doses of ''botulism'' toxin (''Botox'') have been used successfully for some dystonic muscle disorders that are localized to a limited group of muscles. A good response may last several months or more, and the injection may then be repeated.''The treatment of cramps that are associated with specific medical conditions generally focuses on treating the underlying condition. Sometimes, additional medications specifically for cramps are prescribed with certain of these conditions.''Of course, if cramps are severe, frequent, persistent, respond poorly to simple treatments, or are not associated with an obvious cause, then the patient and the doctor need to consider the possibility that more intensive treatment is indicated or that the cramps are a manifestation of another disease. As described above, the possibilities are extremely varied and include problems with circulation, nerves, metabolism, hormones, medications, and ''nutrition''. It is uncommon for muscle cramps to occur as the result of a medical condition without other obvious signs that the medical condition is present.''Cramps are inevitable, but if possible, it would be best to prevent them.' "
How can muscle cramps be prevented during activity?,"'During activity'': Authorities recommend stretching before and after exercise or sports, along with an adequate warm-up and cooldown, to prevent cramps that are caused by vigorous physical activity. Good hydration before, during, and after the activity is important, especially if the duration exceeds one hour, and replacement of lost ''electrolytes'' (especially sodium and potassium, which are major components of perspiration) can also be helpful. Excessive fatigue, especially in warm weather, should be avoided.' "
How much should I drink to prevent muscle cramps?,"'How much should I drink?'' Hydration guidelines should be individualized for each person. The goal is to prevent excessive ''weight loss'' (>2% of body weight). You should weigh yourself before and after exercise to see how much fluid you lose through sweat. One liter of water weighs 2.25 pounds. Depending on the amount of exercise, temperature and humidity, body weight, and other factors, you can lose anywhere from approximately .4 to 1.8 liters per hour.''Pre-exercise hydration (if needed):''During exercise:''Under these conditions, adding modest amounts of salt (0.3 g/L to 0.7 g/L) can offset salt loss in sweat and minimize medical events associated with electrolyte imbalances (for example, muscle cramps, ''hyponatremia'').''Post-exercise:' 0.5 liters per hour for a 180-pound person several hours (three to four hours) prior to exercise. Consuming beverages with sodium and/or small amounts of salted snacks or sodium-containing foods at meals will help to stimulate thirst and retain the consumed fluids. Suggested starting points for marathon runners are 0.4 to 0.8 liters per hour, but again, this should be individualized based on body weight loss. There should be no more than 10% carbohydrate in the beverage, and 7% has generally been considered close to optimal. Carbohydrate consumption is generally recommended only after one hour of exertion. Electrolyte repletion (sodium and potassium) can help sustain electrolyte balance during exercise, particularly whenthere is inadequate access to meals or meals are not eaten,physical activity exceeds four hours in duration, orduring the initial days of hot weather. there is inadequate access to meals or meals are not eaten, physical activity exceeds four hours in duration, or during the initial days of hot weather. Drink approximately 0.5 liters of water for every pound of body weight lost. Consuming beverages and snacks with sodium will help expedite rapid and complete recovery by stimulating thirst and fluid retention."
How can muscle cramps be prevented during pregnancy?,"'During pregnancy'': Supplemental calcium and magnesium have each been shown to help prevent cramps associated with pregnancy. An adequate intake of both of these minerals during pregnancy is important for this and other reasons, but supervision by a qualified health care professional is essential.''While experiencing dystonic cramps'': Cramps that are induced by repetitive non-vigorous activities can sometimes be prevented or minimized by careful attention to ergonomic factors such as wrist supports, avoiding high heels, adjusting chair position, activity breaks, and using comfortable positions and equipment while performing the activity. Learning to avoid excessive tension while executing problem activities can help. However, cramps can remain very troublesome for activities that are difficult to modify, such as playing a musical instrument.' "
Is it possible to prevent rest cramps? ,"'While experiencing rest cramps'': Nocturnal cramps and other rest cramps can often be prevented by regular stretching exercises, particularly if done before going to bed. Even the simple calf-stretching maneuver (described in the first paragraph of the section on treatment), if held for 10 to 15 seconds and repeated two or three times just before going to bed, can be a great help in preventing nocturnal leg cramps. The maneuver can be repeated each time you get up to go to the bathroom during the night and also once or twice during the day. If nocturnal leg cramps are severe and recurrent, a foot board can be used to simulate walking even while recumbent and may prevent awkward positioning of the feet during ''sleep''. Ask your doctor about this remedy.''Another important aspect of ''prevention'' of night cramps is adequate calcium and magnesium. Blood levels may not be sensitive enough to accurately reflect what is happening at the tissue surfaces where the hyperexcitability of the nerve occurs. Calcium intake of at least 1 gram daily is reasonable, and 1.5 grams may be appropriate, particularly for women with or at risk for ''osteoporosis''. An extra dose of calcium at bedtime may help prevent cramps.''Supplemental magnesium may be very beneficial for some, particularly if the person has a magnesium deficiency. However, added magnesium can be very hazardous for people who have difficulty eliminating magnesium, as happens with kidney insufficiency. The vigorous use of diuretics usually increases magnesium loss, and high levels of calcium intake (and therefore of calcium excretion) tend to increase magnesium excretion. Magnesium is present in many foods (greens, grains, meat and fish, bananas, apricots, nuts, and soybeans) and some laxatives and antacids, but a supplemental dose of 50-100 milligrams of magnesium daily may be appropriate. Splitting the dose and taking a portion several times during the day minimizes the tendency to ''diarrhea'' that magnesium can cause.''Vitamin E'' has also been said to help minimize cramp occurrence. Scientific studies documenting this effect are lacking, but anecdotal reports are common. Since vitamin E is thought to have other beneficial health effects and is not toxic in usual doses, taking 400 units of vitamin E daily is approved, recognizing that documentation on its effect on cramps is lacking.' "
Are there particular concerns for older adults?,"'Older adults should have periodic magnesium blood levels taken if they use supplemental magnesium. Even a mild and otherwise not apparent degree of kidney dysfunction, which is often seen in this age group, may lead to toxic levels of magnesium with modest doses.''Recent studies have indicated that ''vitamin D'' (a vitamin required for the normal absorption of calcium from food) deficiency is common in some elderly individuals. Consequently, ''vitamin D'' replacement is important for these people, taking appropriate care to avoid excessive ''vitamin D'' levels, as these are toxic. An intake at least 400 units daily has been recommended in the past; more recently, experts have questioned whether this dose of vitamin D is sufficient, especially for people with little or no sun exposure (sunlight promotes the formation of vitamin D in the body). However, excessive doses of vitamin D are known to be toxic. The upper limit of dosing for vitamin D supplementation has been recommended as 2,000 IU daily. Your health care professional can help you decide how much vitamin D you should take, taking your individual situation and medical history into account.''While the more potent diuretics are associated with an increased loss of calcium and magnesium, ''hydrochlorothiazide'' (''HydroDIURIL'' and others) and related diuretics are associated with calcium and magnesium retention.  Diuretics are commonly used for the treatment of ''hypertension'' and ''heart failure''.  If cramps (or ''osteoporosis'') are also a problem, the patient and doctor may consider using hydrochlorothiazide or another thiazide type of diuretic if otherwise feasible and appropriate.''Diuretics also cause sodium depletion and most also cause potassium depletion.  Many patients who use diuretics are also on sodium-restricted diets. Careful attention to the effects of diuretics on sodium and potassium, and replacement of these elements as needed, is always appropriate, even more so if cramps are a problem.''Older adults often do not hydrate themselves adequately, partly because the sense of thirst diminishes with age.  This situation is exaggerated in those who are treated with diuretics.  For some, simply increasing fluid intake to the generally recommended six to eight glasses a day will improve the cramps.  However, ''drinks'' with  ''caffeine'' should not be counted since they act on the kidneys to increase fluid loss.  Individuals who are on restricted fluid intake should consult their doctor on this issue and must not ignore their recommended fluid intake limits.''As for night cramps, the exact cause is often difficult to determine. The best prevention involves  stretching regularly, adequate fluid intake, appropriate calcium and vitamin D intake, supplemental vitamin E, and ''possibly -- with'' physician ''consultation -- supplemental'' magnesium intake. ' "
Are there medications to prevent muscle cramps?,"'In recent times, the only medication that has been widely used to prevent, and sometimes also to treat, cramps is quinine. Quinine has been used for years in the treatment of ''malaria''. Quinine acts by decreasing the excitability of the muscles. It has also been shown to be effective in many, but not all, scientific studies. However, quinine also causes ''birth defects'' and miscarriages as well as serious side effects. It has also occasionally caused hypersensitivity reactions and a deficiency of platelets, which are the blood components responsible for clotting. Either of these reactions can be fatal. Quinine is also associated with a cluster of symptoms called cinchonism (''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''headaches'', and deafness). Additionally, vision and ''heart'' irregularities can occur. Consequently, quinine tablets are not available in the United States. Quinine is available in grocery stores in tonic water. The U.S. FDA does not recommend or endorse the use of quinine to treat or prevent muscle cramps. Nevertheless, quinine is sometimes recommended as quinine water (tonic water) prior to bedtime to prevent night muscle cramps. Always consult your health care professional before taking quinine for cramps. '  "
What is the prognosis of recurrent muscle cramps?,"'Although cramps can be a great nuisance, they are a benign condition. Their importance is limited to the discomfort and inconvenience they cause, or to the diseases associated with them.  Careful attention to the preceding recommendations will greatly diminish the problem of cramps for most individuals.  Those with persistent or severe muscle cramps should seek medical attention. ' "
How to treat muscle cramps,"'Muscle cramps'' cannot be stopped instantly with injections or pills, but some methods can be useful to relieve them which include''Moreover, ''vitamin B complex'' tablets help treat ''muscle cramps''.'

Which types of medicines treat muscle cramps?,"'Medicines that relieve muscle ''cramps'' are known as muscle relaxants. ''Flexeril'' (''cyclobenzaprine''), ''Norflex'' (''orphenadrine'') and ''Lioresal'' (''baclofen'') are some of the most commonly used muscle relaxants. Recently, ''Botox'' (''botulism'' toxin) injections have been used successfully for muscle cramps.' "
What is a muscle cramp?,"'A ''muscle cramp'' is uncontrolled and forcible tightening of the muscles that fail to relax, which causes ''pain''. It usually affects the calf or foot and may last for several seconds to minutes. Muscle cramps affect approximately 50% to 60% of adults and 7% of children. The prevalence of muscle cramps increases with age and older women are more susceptible to ''leg cramps''.' "
What types of stretches help prevent leg cramps?,'Trying the following stretch may help prevent leg cramps in your calves. Stand about 1 m away from a wall. Bend forward. Touch the wall with your arms stretched out while keeping your ''feet'' flat. Perform this ''exercise'' three times a day for five minutes for effective results.' 
What are the different types of muscle cramps?,'The different types of muscle cramps are as follows' True cramps: These are caused due to hyperactivity of the nerve that stimulates the muscles. Tetany cramps: They are caused due to the activation of all the nerves in the body causing cramps throughout the body. Contracture cramps: These are due to scarring of the soft tissues affecting muscle movements. Dystonic cramps: These are caused due to the stimulation of muscles that are not necessary for the intended movement.
What causes muscle cramps?,"'Usually, there is no cause for muscle cramps.

Facts you should know about myofascial pain syndrome," Muscle pain, tenderness, and spasm are characteristics of myofascial pain syndrome. Myofascial pain syndrome typically affects muscle in asymmetric areas of the body. The precise cause of myofascial pain syndrome is not known. Myofascial pain syndrome leads to localized pain in the muscle tissue. Poor sleep, fatigue, and stiffness are common in myofascial pain syndrome. Myofascial pain syndrome is simply diagnosed based on the areas of complaints of muscle pain and associated tenderness upon examination. Patients have the best prognosis when one physician oversees a multifaceted treatment approach and monitors the response to various therapies."
What is myofascial pain syndrome?,"'Myofascial pain syndrome is characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, and spasm. Myofascial pain syndrome usually involves muscle in body areas that are asymmetric or focal, whereas ''fibromyalgia'' is typically a diffuse and symmetric muscle pain syndrome that involves both sides of the body.' "
What are causes and risk factors for myofascial pain syndrome?,"'The cause of myofascial pain syndrome is unknown. Nevertheless, prior injury, poor ''sleep'' patterns, stressful life situations, and ''depression'' are common underlying conditions that may play a role in inciting and exacerbating myofascial pain syndrome. It is currently felt that risk factors such as these may lead to a change in the ability of the brain to properly process pain perception (referred to as central pain processing).''Myofascial pain may develop from a muscle injury or from excessive strain on a particular muscle or muscle group, ligament or tendon. Other causes include:'   Injury to intervertebral disc General fatigue Repetitive motions Medical conditions (including heart attack, stomach irritation) Lack of activity (such as a broken arm in a sling)"
What are myofascial pain syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'Myofascial pain syndrome causes localized muscle pain. Affected muscles cause the following:''It is also common for patients with myofascial pain syndrome to have poor sleep patterns with decreased recovery sleep (non-rapid-eye movement sleep). This is associated with awakening feeling unrested and daytime ''fatigue''. Stiffness after inactivity is common.' neck pain, upper back pain, and lower back pain, generally affecting one side of the body or one side of the body much more than the other. There is commonly tenderness and spasm in the painful areas and there may be tenderness in areas that are not feeling chronic pain."
What specialties of doctors treat myofascial pain syndrome?,"'Myofascial pain syndrome is commonly treated by primary-care physicians, including family medicine doctors, general practitioners, and internists. Other physicians who treat myofascial pain syndrome include physiatrists, orthopedists, and ''rheumatologists''.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose myofascial pain syndrome?,"'Physicians diagnose myofascial pain syndrome based on the areas of complaints of muscle pain and associated tenderness during a physical examination. Extensive laboratory testing is usually unnecessary. There are no appearance changes (redness, warmth, swelling, etc.) in areas of involvement. The appearance is the same as similar areas on the other side of the body. The widespread, diffuse body involvement that is typical of ''fibromyalgia'' is not present.' "
What is the treatment for myofascial pain syndrome?,"'Optimal treatment of myofascial pain syndrome can be a multifaceted approach. This can include education of the patient,'""Medications used to treat myofascial pain syndrome can be directed toward various features of the individual's condition and may be used temporarily or longer term. Often trials of medications are used to find the best treatment for the particular patient. For example, ""'trazodone'' (''Serzone'') or ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil'') may be used at bedtime to improve sleep as well as relieve pain; ''cyclobenzaprine'' (''Flexeril'') or ''orphenadrine'' (''Norflex'') can be used at bedtime to relax muscles and to aid sleep; and ''antidepressants'' such as ''sertraline'' (''Zoloft''), ''fluoxetine'' (''Prozac''), ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta'') can be used to help control pain as can ''gabapentin'' (''Neurontin'') and ''pregabalin'' (''Lyrica'').'   stress reduction, stretching and exercise programs as well as physical therapy rehabilitation, sleep improvement, and medications all best organized by a single physician who tailors the therapies over time by customizing them for the individual patient."
What are home remedies for myofascial pain syndrome?,"'Home remedies for myofascial pain syndrome include''Ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil''), ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), or ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'') can be beneficial in relieving symptoms of myofascial pain syndrome.' exercise, massage, hot water soaks, and resting."
What is the prognosis of myofascial pain syndrome?,"'Myofascial pain syndrome can resolve with ideal treatment regimens. However, many patients with myofascial pain syndrome have symptoms for years. Outcomes are best when a multifaceted treatment approach is guided by a single physician who is monitoring the response to various therapies employed.' "
Is it possible to prevent myofascial pain syndrome?,"'While myofascial pain syndrome cannot be prevented, it is certainly possible to avoid factors that make the condition worse. This includes avoiding reinjury, minimizing ''stress'', maximizing optimal sleep, and treating any underlying ''depression''.' "
What are the different types of muscle?,"'Muscles are complex structures that cause movement in the body. There are three types of muscle in the body:'   Heart muscle pumps blood (cardiac muscle). Skeletal muscle moves the external body parts, like the arms and legs, neck, back, trunk, and the face. Smooth muscle moves portions of hollow structures inside the body. Examples include the muscles that line the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, muscles that line large arteries, and the muscles of the uterus."
What is skeletal muscle?,"'Skeletal muscles are anchored to bone, either directly or by a tendon. When the muscle contracts, the associated body part moves. This allows arms to lift, legs to run, and the face to smile. Most of these muscles are under willful or conscious control of the brain. This type of muscle is striated or striped with dark-colored muscle fibers containing large amounts of myoglobin, the protein that helps carry oxygen and light-colored fibers that have lesser amounts of the protein. The contraction of a skeletal muscle requires numerous steps within its fibers and cells. The nutrients required to produce energy, oxygen, ''electrolytes'', and glucose are supplied by the bloodstream.' "
What is smooth muscle?,"'Smooth muscle is located in the walls of hollow internal structures in the body, like the arteries, intestines, bladder, and ''iris'' of the eye. They tend to circle the structure and when they contract, the hollow structure is squeezed. These muscles are involuntary and are controlled by the unconscious part of our brain function using the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system always runs in the background, regulating processes within the body. There is a balance between the sympathetic system (adrenergic nerves) that speeds things up and the parasympathetic system (cholinergic nerves) that slows things down. These names are based on the type of chemical that is used to transmit signals at the nerve endings. Adrenaline (epinephrine from the sympathetic nervous system) allows the body to respond to ''stress''. Imagine seeing a bear in the woods; your heart beats faster, your palms get sweaty, your eyes dilate, your hair stands on end, and your bowels move, all because the sympathetic nervous system is activated. Acetylcholine is the chemical that is the anti-adrenaline and is involved in the parasympathetic nervous system that acts to calm us down. Smooth muscle has the same basic contraction mechanism as skeletal muscle, though different proteins are involved.' "
What is a muscle spasm?,"'A muscle spasm, or ''muscle cramp'', is an involuntary contraction of a muscle. Muscle spasms occur suddenly, usually resolve quickly, and are often painful.''A muscle spasm is different than a muscle twitch. A muscle twitch, or fasciculation, is an uncontrolled fine movement of a small segment of a larger muscle that can be seen under the skin.' "
What are common causes of muscle spasms?,"'There are a variety of causes of muscle spasms, and each depends upon predisposing factors, the part of the body involved, and the environment that the body is in.''Spasms may occur when a muscle is overused, tired, previously injured, or strained. The spasm may occur if the muscle has been overstretched or if it has been held in the same position for a prolonged period of time. In effect, the muscle cell runs out of energy and fluid and becomes hyperexcitable, resulting in a forceful contraction. This spasm may involve part of a muscle, the whole muscle, or even adjacent muscles.''Overuse as a cause of skeletal muscle spasm is often seen in athletes who are doing strenuous ''exercise'' in a hot environment. This is also an occupational issue with construction workers or others working in a hot environment. Usually, the spasms will occur in the large muscles that are strained, being asked to do the work. When this occurs associated with heat exposure, the condition is also known as ''heat cramps''.''Overuse can also occur with routine daily activities like shoveling snow, or mowing or raking grass, causing muscle spasms of the neck, shoulder, and back.'  "
What causes muscle spasms? (Part 2),"'Unfamiliar ''exercise'' activities can also cause muscle spasms to occur. Abdominal spasms can occur when a person decides to begin working their abdominal muscles by doing sit-ups and repeating too many too quickly.'""Writer's ""'cramps'' of the hand and fingers are similarly caused by prolonged use of the small muscles in the hand and the overused muscles cramp. People will routinely rest and stretch their fingers either to prevent or treat this situation.''It is commonly thought that ''dehydration'' and depletion of electrolytes will lead to muscle spasm and cramping. Muscle cells require enough water, glucose, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium to allow the proteins within them to develop an organized contraction. Abnormal supply of these elements can cause the muscle to become irritable and develop spasm.''Atherosclerosis'' or narrowing of the arteries (''peripheral artery disease'') may also lead to muscle spasm and cramps, again because an inadequate blood supply and nutrients are delivered to the muscle. Peripheral artery disease can decrease the flow of blood to the legs, causing pain in the legs with activity. There may also be associated ''muscle cramps''.''Leg spasms are often seen related to exercise, but cramps may also be seen at night involving calf and toe muscles. ''Nocturnal'' ''leg cramps'' and ''restless legs syndrome'' are considered a type of ''sleep'' disturbance. Their prevalence increases with age and often a precise cause is not found.''Chronic neck and ''back pain'' can lead to recurrent muscles spasms. Large muscle groups make up the trunk, including the neck, chest wall, upper back, lower back, arms, and legs. Spasms in these muscles can be a result of an injury or they may develop over time because of arthritic changes in the spine. ''Obesity'' can cause ''stress'' and strain of the core muscles of the trunk, resulting in ''muscle cramps'' of the neck and upper and lower back. Systemic illnesses like ''diabetes'', ''anemia'' (''low red blood cell count''), ''kidney disease'', and thyroid and other hormone issues are also potential causes of muscle spasms.''Diseases of the nervous system, such as ''amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'', ''multiple sclerosis'', or ''spinal cord injury'', can be associated with muscle spasm.''Smooth muscle can also go into spasm. When a hollow structure filled with air or fluid is squeezed by the muscle spasm, significant pain may occur, since the fluid or air cannot be compressed. For example, smooth muscle in the intestinal wall can go into spasm, causing waves of pain called ''colic''. Colicky pain which tends to come and go may also occur within the bile duct that empties the gallbladder and may develop after eating.''The coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle with blood also have smooth muscle within their walls that may go into spasm. This can cause ''chest pain'' that may be indistinguishable from the pain of ''coronary artery disease'' (where plaque has accumulated and narrowed the arteries). ''Coronary artery spasm'' often occurs in ''smokers'' or those who have ''high cholesterol'' blood levels. Coronary artery spasm may be triggered by stress, ''alcohol withdrawal'', stimulant ''drug abuse'' (especially ''cocaine'"") or medications that can constrict or narrow blood vessels. Coronary artery spasm is also known as Prinzmetal's ""'angina''.' When kidney stones try to pass through the urinary tract, the smooth muscles that are in the walls of the ureter (that connects the kidney to the bladder) may spasm rhythmically and cause significant pain. Often this type of pain is associated with nausea and vomiting and is called renal colic. Muscles that surround the esophagus can go into spasm when acid reflux causes irritation of the lining of the esophagus, resulting in esophagitis or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Diarrhea can be associated with colicky pain, where the muscles within the colon wall spasm just before a watery bowel movement. Menstrual cramps occur when the walls of the uterus contract forcefully."
What causes muscle spasms? (Part 3),"'Dystonias are movement disorders where groups of muscles forcefully contract and cause twisting. Uncontrolled repetitive movements and the inability to maintain normal posture may be the result of this type of muscle spasm and cramping. The symptoms may be very mild initially but gradually progress to become more frequent and aggressive. Occasionally, there is no progression. Examples of this type of muscle spasm include torticollis (where the neck muscles spasm and cause the head to turn to one side), blepharospasm (where there is uncontrolled blinking of the eyes), and laryngeal ''dystonia'' that affects the muscles that control speech. Dystonias may be caused by abnormally functioning neurotransmitter chemicals within part of the brain called the basal ganglia. These chemicals (serotonin, ''dopamine'', acetylcholine, and GABA) are required to properly send messages between brain cells that begin muscle contraction. ''Dystonia'' symptoms may occur as a complication of ''stroke''.' "
What are risk factors for muscle spasms?,"""Most people are at risk for developing a muscle spasm at one time in their life, from infant colic to kidney stones. The risks differ depending upon the person's past medical history, their occupation, and level of physical activity. Examples include the following:"" Construction and factory workers who work in hot environments are at risk for becoming dehydrated and developing heat cramps. This same situation can occur in athletes, both elite and recreational. Patients with peripheral artery disease can develop leg cramps at night. Risk factors are the same as for stroke and heart attack: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. Patients who have underlying neurologic disorders are at risk for developing muscle spasms."
What are the symptoms and signs of muscle spasms?,"'The symptoms and signs of muscle spasm depend upon the muscle involved and the circumstances leading up to the spasm.''Skeletal muscle spasm usually involves muscles that are being asked to do excessive work. There is acute onset of ''muscle pain'' as it contracts. A bulging, tight muscle may be seen or felt underneath the skin where the muscle is located. Most often, the spasm resolves spontaneously after a few seconds though it may last many minutes or longer. Usually, those affected will feel the need to stretch the muscle involved, thus relieving the spasm and resolving the episode. With heat cramps, the muscle spasm may occur minutes or hours after the activity is completed.'""A muscle fasciculation or twitch may last just a few seconds or may be a recurrent event. Usually, it's just a momentary repetitive contraction of just a few muscle fibers of a larger muscle in a localized area served by one nerve ""'fiber''. This often involves the ''eyelid'', calf, thigh, or thumb. The fasciculations often come and go and may be related to stress, ''anxiety'', or ingestion of ''stimulants'' like ''caffeine''. The stimulants pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine found in ''over-the-counter'' ''cold'' medications may also cause this twitch. Medications such as ''albuterol'' (Ventolin, Proventil, ''AccuNeb'', ''VoSpire'', ProAir) used for the treatment of ''asthma'' and medications used to treat ''attention deficit disorder'' (''Adderall'') may be associated with twitching. These twitches are considered harmless and are referred to as benign fasciculations.''However, muscle twitching may also be associated with neurologic disorders such as muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and myopathy (a primary muscle illness). With these diseases, associated symptoms include ''weakness'', muscle wasting with loss of muscle size, and change in sensation.''Smooth muscle spasm will cause colicky pain that comes and goes. The symptoms will depend upon the organ involved.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose muscle spasms?,"'Most people have experienced a skeletal muscle spasm due to overexertion, especially in a warm environment, and are able to self-diagnose. However, if the spasms are severe, last a long time, or keep recurring, it is reasonable to see a health-care professional for evaluation.''The diagnosis usually begins with history and physical examination. It is helpful to know the circumstances surrounding the muscle spasms.''Sometimes the physical examination may be normal since the muscle spasms may not be present during the visit. However, the physical examination may useful in detecting underlying health issues that may be helpful in making the diagnosis. For example, if the patient is complaining of leg muscle cramps, the examination may include palpating or feeling for pulses in the ''feet''. Atherosclerosis, or ''hardening of the arteries'', may be associated with the loss of arterial pulse in the involved extremity.''For those having pain from smooth muscle spasm, the pain may be severe enough to present to an emergency department. The history and physical examination will be directed to finding the source of the pain, while at the same time trying to control the symptoms. ''Kidney stone'' pain (renal colic) and gallbladder pain sometime require anti-inflammatory or narcotic pain medication. They are often associated with ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' and these symptoms may also require treatment. Some patients with ''irritable bowel'' condition may also present with significant intestinal spasm, ''abdominal pain'', and ''constipation'' or ''diarrhea''.''For patients with recurrent muscle spasm where the cause is not easily diagnosed by history and physical examination, testing may be necessary to give direction as to potential causes. Blood tests may or may not be indicated depending upon the situation and whether or not the diagnosis can be adequately attained by history and physical examination. Blood tests may include a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') looking for ''anemia'', electrolytes (especially sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium), glucose, and ''creatinine'' (to check for kidney function). Thyroid function tests may also be considered.''If muscle spasms are prolonged and ongoing, there may be a concern that muscle breakdown and damage is occurring. A creatine phosphokinase (CPK) blood test can be used to detect this. It is an enzyme released into the bloodstream by irritated or damaged muscle tissue. ''Rhabdomyolysis'' can lead to ''kidney failure''.''If there is concern that the spasms are due to a nerve or muscle disorder, electromyography (''EMG'') may be done to determine whether there may be an abnormality of the muscle, of the nerves, or both.''If there is concern about the potential for peripheral artery disease, tests of blood flow to the legs may be considered, including an ankle-brachial index (ABI) which compares blood pressures in the arms and legs and ''ultrasound'' and ''angiography'' (often using CT or ''MRI'') to directly assess the blood vessels.''If nocturnal leg cramps are thought to be associated with a ''sleep'' disturbance, sleep studies might be indicated.' When did they begin? How long do they last? How frequently do they occur? Are they rhythmic or more random? Is it always the same muscle group of the body involved? Other information that is helpful includes understanding the general health of the patient and whether there have been any recent illnesses or whether any medications have been taken, including prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, food supplements, and herbal remedies. Past medical history may give a clue as to the reason for the muscle cramps. These may include a history of diabetes, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, and spinal cord injury. Work or exercise history may be of importance. Environment is also an important information regarding heat exposure and associated signs and symptoms of dehydration."
What are treatment options for muscle spasms?,"'Prevention'' is the key to most skeletal muscle spasm episodes. Since they are often associated with dehydration and electrolyte disturbances, it is important to keep the body well hydrated. If the fluid loss is due to an illness with ''fever'' or vomiting and diarrhea, controlling the symptoms will help limit fluid loss and prevent spasms. Similarly, for those who work or exercise in a hot environment, drinking enough fluids to keep hydrated is very important. It is often helpful to hydrate prior to activities in warm environments.''Muscles should also be prepared for the activity that they are expected to do. Just as athletes stretch and warm up before the game, nonathletes should warm up before heavy ''labor'', including jobs like raking, mowing, and shoveling snow.''Should a large skeletal muscle go into spasm (often referred to as a charley horse), the initial treatment is to gently stretch the muscle back to length to break the spasm cycle and resolve the acute situation. For example, ''first aid'' for a hamstring spasm (where the muscles in the back of the thigh are affected) includes straightening the ''knee joint'' and flexing the hip, which stretches the muscles and helps resolve their spasm.''Further treatment will depend upon the underlying cause of the muscle spasms. For muscles that have been damaged or strained, medications may be required for short-term pain relief, including anti-inflammatories (''ibuprofen'' [''Advil'', ''Motrin'']), narcotics, and muscle relaxants.''The treatment of smooth muscle spasm, such as bowel spasm, depends upon diagnosing and treating the underlying cause.''Nocturnal leg cramps are difficult to control and treat. Historically, quinine has been prescribed to help with the muscle spasms, but this drug can have side effects including abnormal bleeding problems. Other medications, including B-complex ''vitamins'', ''gabapentin'' and ''diltiazem'', may be helpful.''Many possible treatments are available for the dystonias. The decision as to which medication to use depends upon the individual situation. It may take trial and error to find the right medication in the right dose to control symptoms.'   Anti-Parkinsonism drugs, like trihexyphenidyl HCl (Artane) and benztropine mesylate (Cogentin), decrease acetylcholine levels. Muscle relaxants like diazepam (Valium) and baclofen (Lioresal) affect GABA receptors. Levodopa (Sinemet) and reserpine (Harmonyl) affect dopamine levels. Carbamazepine (Tegretol), a seizure-control drug, may be useful in some patients. Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) may be injected into a specific muscle to paralyze it and relieve the muscle spasm of dystonia, such as for blepharospasms."
What types of health care professionals treat muscle spasms?,"'Primary-care providers treat patients with muscle spasms. Often, the spasms tend not to cause prolonged symptoms that require emergent or urgent care, and the patient sees their regular health care provider for evaluation and treatment.''However, some situations require more aggressive intervention, depending upon the situation, and emergency providers often see those with illnesses associated with smooth muscle spasm, including abdominal or ''chest pain'' that may ultimately be diagnosed as kidney or gallbladder colic, ''irritable bowel syndrome'', or esophageal spasm.''Skeletal muscle spasm might be evaluated by emergency physicians when there is also ''heat-related illness'' present or there is concern regarding muscle damage.''Different situations may require the services of specific specialists. For example, patients who have leg cramps may have a sleep disorder and may need care by a sleep specialist. Neurologists care for patients with movement disorders. Endocrinologists help control diabetes. Vascular surgeons may be required to discuss treatment options for patients with ''peripheral vascular disease''.' "
What is the prognosis for muscle spasms?,"'Most people experience infrequent muscle spasms and do well with prevention (keeping well hydrated and not overusing their body).''However, those who have an underlying medical condition as a cause of muscle spasms often need to treat the original medical problem to help control the muscle spasms. This is especially true for those with peripheral artery disease or movement disorders.' "
How long do muscle spasms last?,"'Skeletal muscles cramps or spasms tend to last only a few seconds, and the patient feels the need to stretch the muscle to resolve the spasm.''Smooth muscle cramps may last for a prolonged period of time until the underlying problem that caused the spasm is resolved. Renal colic can last for hours, as can colicky pain with diarrhea or menstrual cramps.''Involuntary muscle twitching is a significant problem because it may last for prolonged time frames and need medications to control or resolve the spasm and the associated pain.' "
What is spinal muscular atrophy?,"'Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of several hereditary diseases that progressively destroy lower motor neurons-nerve cells in the brain stem and spinal cord that control essential voluntary muscle activity such as speaking, walking, breathing, and swallowing. Lower motor neurons control movement in the arms, legs, chest, face, throat, and tongue.''When there are disruptions in the signals between lower motor neurons and muscles, the muscles gradually weaken and may begin wasting away and develop uncontrollable twitching (called fasciculations). When there are disruptions in the signals between the upper motor neurons (located in the brain) and the lower motor neurons, the limb muscles develop ''stiffness'' (called ''spasticity''), movements become slow and effortful, and tendon reflexes such as knee and ankle jerks become overactive. Over time, the ability to control voluntary movement can be lost.' "
What are the types and symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy?,"'Spinal muscular atrophy in children is classified into three types, based on ages of onset, severity, and progression of symptoms. All three types are caused by defects in the SMN1 gene.''Other forms of spinal muscular atrophy include:'  Spinal muscular atrophy type I, also called Werdnig-Hoffmann disease or infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy, is evident by the time a child is 6 months old. Symptoms may include hypotonia (severely reduced muscle tone), diminished limb movements, lack of tendon reflexes, fasciculations, tremors, swallowing and feeding difficulties, and impaired breathing. Some children also develop scoliosis (curvature of the spine) or other skeletal abnormalities. Affected children never sit or stand and the vast majority usually die of respiratory failure before the age of 2. However, the survival rate in individuals with spinal muscular atrophy type I has increased in recent years, in relation to the growing trend toward more proactive clinical care. Symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy type II, the intermediate form, usually begin between 6 and 18 months of age. Children may be able to sit without support but are unable to stand or walk unaided, and may have respiratory difficulties, including an increased risk of respiratory infections. The progression of disease is variable. Life expectancy is reduced but some individuals live into adolescence or young adulthood. Symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy type III (Kugelberg-Welander disease) appear between 2 and 17 years of age and include abnormal gait; difficulty running, climbing steps, or rising from a chair; and a fine tremor of the fingers. The lower extremities are most often affected. Complications include scoliosis and joint contractures-chronic shortening of muscles or tendons around joints, caused by abnormal muscle tone and weakness, which prevents the joints from moving freely. Individuals with spinal muscular atrophy type III may be prone to respiratory infections, but with care may have a normal lifespan. Congenital spinal muscular atrophy with arthrogryposis (persistent contracture of joints with fixed abnormal posture of the limb) is a rare disorder. Manifestations include severe contractures, scoliosis, chest deformity, respiratory problems, unusually spinal muscular small jaws, and drooping of the upper eyelids. Kennedy's disease, also known as progressive spinobulbar muscular atrophy, may first be recognized between 15 and 60 years of age. The onset of symptoms varies and includes weakness and atrophy of the facial, jaw, and tongue muscles, leading to problems with chewing, swallowing, and changes in speech. Early symptoms may include muscle pain and fatigue. Weakness in arm and leg muscles closest to the trunk of the body develops over time, with muscle atrophy and fasciculations. Individuals with Kennedy's disease also develop sensory loss in the feet and hands. Nerve conduction studies confirm that nearly all individuals have a sensory neuropathy (pain from sensory nerve inflammation or degeneration). Affected individuals may have enlargement of the male breasts or develop noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus."
What causes spinal muscular atrophy?,"'Spinal muscular atrophy is caused by defects in the gene SMN1, which makes a protein that is important for the survival of motor neurons (SMN protein). In spinal muscular atrophy, insufficient levels of the SMN protein lead to degeneration of the lower motor neurons, producing ''weakness'' and wasting of the skeletal muscles. This weakness is often more severe in the trunk and upper leg and arm muscles than in muscles of the hands and ''feet''.' "
How is spinal muscular atrophy inherited?,"'Spinal muscular atrophy disorders in children are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Autosomal recessive means the child must inherit a copy of the defective gene from both parents. These parents are likely to be asymptomatic (without symptoms of the disease). Autosomal recessive diseases often affect more than one person in the same generation (siblings or cousins).'""Kennedy's disease, an adult form of spinal muscular atrophy is X-linked inherited, which means the mother carries the defective gene on one of her X chromosomes and passes the disorder along to her sons. Males inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father, while females inherit an X chromosome from each parent. Daughters have a 50 percent chance of inheriting their mother's faulty X chromosome and a safe X chromosome from their father, which would make them asymptomatic carriers of the mutation."" "
How is spinal muscular atrophy diagnosed?,"""A test is available that can indicate whether there are deletions or mutations of the SMN1 gene. This test identifies at least 95 percent of spinal muscular atrophy Types I, II, and III. Other diagnostic tests may include electromyography (which records the electrical activity from the brain and/or spinal cord to a peripheral nerve root found in the arms and legs that controls muscles during contraction and at rest), nerve conduction velocity studies (which measure electrical energy by assessing the nerve's ability to send a signal), muscle biopsy (used to diagnose neuromuscular disorders and may also reveal if a person is a carrier of a defective gene that could be passed on to children), and laboratory tests of blood, urine, and other substances."" "
What drugs and lifestyle changes help manage spinal muscular atrophy symptoms and signs? Can it be cured?,"'There is no cure for spinal muscular atrophy. Treatment consists of managing the symptoms and preventing complications.''Muscle relaxants such as ''baclofen'', ''tizanidine'', and the ''benzodiazepines'' may reduce spasticity. Botulinum toxin may be used to treat jaw spasms or ''drooling''. Excessive saliva can be treated with ''amitriptyline'', ''glycopyrrolate'', and ''atropine'' or by botulinum injections into the salivary glands. ''Antidepressants'' may be helpful in treating ''depression''.''Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation may help to improve posture, prevent joint immobility, and slow muscle weakness and atrophy. Stretching and strengthening exercises may help reduce spasticity, increase range of motion, and keeps circulation flowing. Some individuals require additional therapy for speech, chewing, and swallowing difficulties. Applying heat may relieve muscle ''pain''. Assistive devices such as supports or ''braces'', orthotics, speech synthesizers, and wheelchairs may help some people retain independence.''Proper ''nutrition'' and a balanced ''diet'' are essential to maintaining weight and strength. People who cannot chew or swallow may require insertion of a feeding tube. Non-invasive ventilation at night can prevent apnea in ''sleep'', and some individuals may also require assisted ventilation due to muscle weakness in the neck, throat, and chest during daytime.' "
What is the prognosis and lifespan for spinal muscular atrophy?," The prognosis varies depending on the type of spinal muscular atrophy. Some forms of spinal muscular atrophy are fatal. The course of Kennedy's disease varies but is generally slowly progressive. Individuals tend to remain ambulatory until late in the disease. The life expectancy for individuals with Kennedy disease is usually normal. People with spinal muscular atrophy may appear to be stable for long periods, but improvement should not be expected."
What research is being done on spinal muscular atrophy?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducts basic, translational, and clinical research on spinal muscular atrophy in laboratories at the NIH and also supports research through grants to major medical institutions across the country.''Cellular and molecular studies seek to understand the mechanisms that trigger motor neurons to degenerate.''Scientists are developing a broad range of model systems in animals and cells to investigate disease processes and expedite the testing of potential therapies. Among these efforts:''NINDS has established the NeuroNext ''clinical trials'' network to promote the rapid development and implementation of trials for neurological disorders that affect adults and/or children. Among its goals, the network is designed to develop early-phase trials aimed at identifying biomarkers-usually a physical trait or substance in the blood or other bodily fluids that can be measured to determine the presence and severity of a disease-and testing promising, emerging therapies. One of the first projects in this new network will hope to identify biomarkers for spinal muscular atrophy, which could speed the development of effective treatments for the disease.' Scientists have used gene therapy to halt motor neuron destruction and slow disease progression in mouse models of spinal muscular atrophy. The NINDS supports research to further explore this method and to provide a path toward clinical tests in patients. Scientists have found that a specific class of compounds referred to as anti-sense oligonucleotides can either block or correct the processing of RNA molecules, which are the intermediates between genes and proteins. These compounds have shown therapeutic promise in model systems of spinal muscular atrophy. Animal models of spinal muscular atrophy represent critical tools in discovering and developing new therapies for spinal muscular atrophy. Scientists have developed new zebrafish, mouse, and pig models, including models of less severe spinal muscular atrophy types 2 and 3, which may greatly facilitate the identification of new therapeutic targets and candidate therapies."

What Causes Musculoskeletal Pain?,"'The causes of musculoskeletal ''pain'' are varied. Muscle tissue can be damaged with the wear and tear of daily activities. ''Trauma'' to an area (jerking movements, auto accidents, falls, ''fractures'', ''sprains'', dislocations, and direct blows to the muscle) also can cause musculoskeletal ''pain''. Other causes of pain include postural strain, repetitive movements, overuse, and prolonged immobilization. Changes in posture or poor body mechanics may bring about spinal alignment problems and muscle shortening, therefore causing other muscles to be misused and become painful.' "
What Are the Symptoms of Musculoskeletal Pain?,"'People with musculoskeletal pain sometimes complain that their entire bodies ache. Their muscles may feel like they have been pulled or overworked.

How do I know if my child has auditory processing disorder?,"'Auditory processing disorder'' (APD) affects the way your child’s brain perceives auditory (relating to the sense of ''hearing'') information. It makes it difficult for your child to understand sounds including spoken words.''Signs that a child may have APD are as follows''You must remember that these symptoms overlap with behaviors caused by other conditions such as ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD'') or other language or learning disorders. Thus, you must seek your doctor’s help to confirm whether your child has APD.' The child gets easily distracted. The child is extremely bothered by loud or sudden noises. The child gets upset because of a noisy environment. The child’s behavior and performance become better when they are in a quieter place. The child finds it difficult to follow directions, whether simple or complicated. The child has speech-language difficulties with activities like reading, spelling and writing. The child does not pick up nursery rhymes or lyrics of a song. The child finds it hard to follow conversations or express themselves. The child finds verbal or word math problems difficult. The child is disorganized or forgetful. The child frequently asks people to repeat what they said. The child appears to be hearing, but not listening and understanding."
What is auditory processing disorder?,"'Auditory processing disorder'' (APD) is also called central auditory processing disorder (CAPD). The condition affects a person in a way that they cannot process what they hear normally. It is a problem that makes it difficult for a child to understand sounds including spoken words. APD affects about 5% of school-aged children. The affected child may have normal hearing, but they miss many details of what is being said, especially in distracting or noisy places.''Problems in APD occur in a child because their ears and brain do not fully coordinate. There is some perturbation in the way the brain recognizes and interprets sounds, especially speech.''Early diagnosis of this disorder is crucial because with the right therapy, the child can have a healthy and successful life. Delay in the diagnosis of APD can make the child have speech-language delays or learning problems at school and home.' "
What is the treatment for auditory processing disorder (APD)?,"'The treatment for auditory processing disorder (APD) is highly individualized and consists of a multipronged approach. The treatment is primarily focused on three main areas\xa0''Your healthcare provider will provide auditory training that involves activities to improve your child’s listening and concentration abilities. Electronic devices such as a wireless earpiece that connects to a small microphone worn by the teacher may be used in schoolchildren to reduce background noises. At school, making the child sit in places such as in the front of the classroom or with their back to the window may help learning and concentration. Study aids such as a tape recorder or notes that can be viewed online may help. Several computer-assisted programs are available to help school kids with this disorder.''At home, you can' Changing the learning or communication environment Enhancing higher-order skills to help compensate for the disorder Treating auditory deficit itself Provide your child with a quiet place to study and learn. Talk face-to-face with your child. Communicate using simple and expressive sentences. Talk to your child by speaking at a slightly slower rate and at a mildly increased volume. Make your child repeat the directions back to you and keep repeating them aloud until the directions are completed. Ask your child to make notes, wear a watch or maintain a household routine. Foster a peaceful and organized lifestyle. Help your child maintain good eating and sleeping habits. Make your child perform regular and realistic chores, including keeping a clean and organized room and desk. Keep motivating your child and help them build self-esteem."
What should I know about myasthenia gravis?*,"'*This ''myasthenia gravis'' section written by Charles Patrick Davis, MD, PhD''What is the medical definition of myasthenia gravis?''What symptoms would you expect from myasthenia gravis?''What is the cause of myasthenia gravis?''How do you test for\xa0myasthenia gravis?''Is myasthenia gravis life threatening?' Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by varying degrees of weakness of the skeletal (voluntary) muscles of the body. The thymus may give incorrect instructions to developing immune cells, ultimately resulting in autoimmunity and the production of the acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Symptoms and signs of myasthenia gravis may include:Problems with vision, called ocular myasthenia gravis and include:Eye muscle weaknessEyelid drooping (ptosis)Blurry or double vision (diplopia)Problems walkingChanges in facial expressionsProblems swallowingShortness of breathProblems speakingWeakness in the arms, hands, fingers, legs, and neck Problems with vision, called ocular myasthenia gravis and include:Eye muscle weaknessEyelid drooping (ptosis)Blurry or double vision (diplopia) Eye muscle weakness Eyelid drooping (ptosis) Blurry or double vision (diplopia) Problems walking Changes in facial expressions Problems swallowing Shortness of breath Problems speaking Weakness in the arms, hands, fingers, legs, and neck Myasthenia gravis is caused by a defect in the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles. Myasthenia gravis is not directly inherited nor is it contagious. Commonly, the disease affects adult women (under 40) and older men (over 60), but it can occur at any age. Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis often is delayed because muscle weakness is a common symptom other diseases and conditions and may slowly develop. Tests to diagnose myasthenia gravis is diagnosed with tests that help confirm the diagnosis include:Detecting the presence of immune molecules or acetylcholine receptor antibodiesEdrophonium testElectromyography Detecting the presence of immune molecules or acetylcholine receptor antibodies Edrophonium test Electromyography Myasthenia gravis is treated with medications, for example:The drug Soliris is approved for adult patients with generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) who are anti-AchR antibody-positive.Anticholinesterase agents (for example, neotigmine)PlasmapheresisVarious immunosuppressive drugsSurgical treatment may include removal of the thymus. The drug Soliris is approved for adult patients with generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) who are anti-AchR antibody-positive. Anticholinesterase agents (for example, neotigmine) Plasmapheresis Various immunosuppressive drugs Surgical treatment may include removal of the thymus. A myasthenic crisis occurs when the muscles that control breathing weaken so much that you need emergency ventilation assistance to help breath. The disease prognosis and life expectancy is highly variable. Some people have complete remission (about 50% with thymus surgery) others have relatively normal lives with continued treatment, and others have a poor prognosis as the disease advances. Research is ongoing for myasthenia gravis. New treatment protocols and immunosuppressive drugs are being tried, and therapeutic methods are likely to improve in the future."
What is myasthenia gravis?,"'Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by symptoms and signs of various degrees of weakness of the skeletal (voluntary) muscles of the body. The name myasthenia gravis is Latin and Greek in origin, which literally means ""grave muscle weakness."" With current therapies, most people with myasthenia gravis are not as ""grave"" as the name implies. Most people with myasthenia gravis have a normal life expectancy.''The hallmark symptom of myasthenia gravis is muscle weakness that increases during periods of activity and improves after periods of rest. Certain muscles such as those that control eye and eyelid movement, facial expression, chewing, talking, and swallowing often are, but not always, involved in the disorder. Muscles that control breathing and neck and limb movements may be affected.'""The thymus gland, which lies in the chest area beneath the breastbone, plays an important role in the development of the immune system in early life. Its cells form a part of the body's normal immune system. The gland is somewhat large in infants, grows gradually until ""'puberty'', and then gets smaller and is replaced by fat with age. In adults with myasthenia gravis, the thymus gland remains large and is abnormal. It contains certain clusters of immune cells indicative of lymphoid hyperplasia is a condition which usually is found only in the spleen and ''lymph nodes'' during an active immune response. Some people with the condition develop thymomas (tumors of the thymus gland). Thymomas are generally benign, but they can become ''malignant''\xa0(cancerous).''The relationship between the thymus gland and myasthenia gravis is not yet fully understood. Scientists believe the thymus gland may give incorrect instructions to developing immune cells, ultimately resulting in autoimmunity and the production of the acetylcholine receptor antibodies, thereby setting the stage for the attack on neuromuscular transmission.'

What signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis?,"'Although myasthenia gravis may affect any:''The onset of the myasthenia gravis may be sudden so often signs and symptoms are not immediately noticed.''The first symptoms of myasthenia gravis in most people with the disease is weakness of the eye muscles while others may have signs and symptoms of swallowing problems and slurred speech.''The degree of muscle weakness involved in myasthenia gravis varies greatly among individuals, ranging from a localized form limited to eye muscles (ocular myasthenia), to a severe or generalized form in which many muscles -- sometimes including those that control breathing -- are affected.''Myasthenia gravis symptoms'', which vary in type and severity, may include:' Voluntary muscle. Muscles that control eye and eyelid movement Facial expressions. Swallowing problems are common. One or both eyelids drooping (ptosis) Blurred or double vision (diplopia) due to weakness of the muscles that control eye movements Instablility when walking Changes in facial expressions Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) Shortness of breath Impaired speech (dysarthria) Weakness in the arms, hands, fingers, legs, and neck"
What is myasthenic crisis? What are the symptoms and signs? Is it life threatening?,"'Myasthenic crisis ''occurs when the muscles that control breathing weaken to the point that ventilation is inadequate that creates a medical emergency, which requires a respirator for assisted ventilation. In people whose respiratory muscles are weak, crises, which generally requires immediate medical treatment. Myasthenic crises may be triggered by an:' Infection Fever Adverse reaction to a medication(s)"
Who gets myasthenia gravis? Is it inherited? Is it contagious?," Myasthenia gravis occurs in all ethnic groups and both females and males. Commonly, the disease occurs in young adult women (under 40) and older men (over 60), but it can occur at any age. In neonatal myasthenia, the fetus may acquire immune proteins (antibodies) from a mother affected with myasthenia gravis. Generally, cases of neonatal myasthenia gravis are temporary and the child's symptoms usually disappear within 2-3 months after birth. Other children develop myasthenia gravis indistinguishable from adults. Myasthenia gravis in juveniles is uncommon. Myasthenia gravis is not directly inherited nor is it contagious. However, occasionally the disease may occur in more than one member of the same family. Rarely, children may show signs of congenital myasthenia or congenital myasthenic syndrome. These are not autoimmune disorders but are caused by defective genes that produce abnormal proteins instead of those that would normally produce acetylcholine, acetylcholinesterase (the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine), or the acetylcholine receptor and other proteins present along the muscle membrane."
What causes myasthenia gravis?,"'Myasthenia gravis is caused by a defect in the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles. It occurs when normal communication between the nerve and muscle is interrupted at the neuromuscular junction -- the place where nerve cells connect with the muscles they control. Normally when impulses travel down the nerve, the nerve endings release a neurotransmitter substance called acetylcholine. Acetylcholine travels from the neuromuscular junction and binds to acetylcholine receptors which are activated and generate a muscle contraction.'""In myasthenia gravis, antibodies block, alter, or destroy the receptors for acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, which prevents the muscle contraction from occurring. These antibodies are produced by the body's own immune system. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease because the immune system -- which normally protects the body from foreign organisms -- mistakenly attacks itself."" "
What procedures and test diagnose myasthenia gravis?,"'Because weakness is a common symptom of many other disorders, diagnosing myasthenia gravis often s missed or delayed (sometimes up to two years) in people who experience mild weakness or in those whose weakness is restricted to only a few muscles.''procedures and tests to diagnose myasthenia gravis include:'   Reviewing your medical history and will perform physical and neurological examinations. The doctor will look for impairment of eye movements or muscle weakness without any changes in your ability to feel things. If the doctor suspects myasthenia gravis, several tests are available to confirm the diagnosis. A special blood test can detect the presence of immune molecules or acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Most people with myasthenia gravis have abnormally elevated levels of these antibodies. Recently, a second antibody -- called the anti-MuSK antibody -- has been found in about 30% to 40% of people with myasthenia gravis who do not have acetylcholine receptor antibodies. This antibody also can be tested for in the blood. However, neither of these antibodies is present in some people with the disease. Usually, it occurs in those with ocular myasthenia gravis. The edrophonium test uses IV of edrophonium chloride to very briefly relieve weakness in people with myasthenia gravis. The drug blocks the degradation (breakdown) of acetylcholine and temporarily increases the levels of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Other methods to confirm the diagnosis include a version of nerve conduction study, which tests for specific muscle ""fatigue"" by repetitive nerve stimulation. This test records weakening muscle responses when the nerves are repetitively stimulated by small pulses of electricity. Repetitive stimulation of a nerve during a nerve conduction study may demonstrate gradual decreases of the muscle action potential due to impaired nerve-to-muscle transmission. Single fiber electromyography (EMG) detects impaired nerve-to-muscle transmission and measures the electrical potential of muscle cells when single muscle fibers are stimulated by electrical impulses. Muscle fibers in myasthenia gravis, as well as other neuromuscular disorders, do not respond as well to repeated electrical stimulation compared to muscles from normal people. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest may be used to identify the presence of a thymoma. Pulmonary function testing measures breathing strength and helps to predict whether respiration may fail and lead to a myasthenic crisis."
What is the treatment for myasthenia gravis?,"'Generally, myasthenia gravis can be managed. Several therapies are available that help reduce and improve muscle weakness.''Medications used for the treatment of myasthenia gravis include:''These medications improve muscle strength by suppressing the production of abnormal antibodies. They should be carefully monitored by your doctor because they may cause major side effects.'   Anticholinesterase agents, for example, neostigmine and pyridostigmine bromide (Mestinon), which help improve neuromuscular transmission and increase muscle strength. Immunosuppressive drugs, for exampleprednisoneazathioprineCyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetiltacrolimus prednisone azathioprine Cyclosporin, mycophenolate mofetil tacrolimus"
What is the prognosis?,"'With treatment, most individuals with myasthenia can significantly improve their muscle weakness and lead normal or nearly normal lives. Some cases of myasthenia gravis may go into remission -- either temporarily or permanently -- and muscle weakness may disappear completely so that medications can be discontinued. Stable, long-lasting complete remissions are the goal of thymectomy and may occur in about 50 percent of individuals who undergo this procedure. In a few cases, the severe weakness of myasthenia gravis may cause respiratory failure, which requires immediate emergency medical care.' "
What research is being done?,"'Within the Federal government, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has primary responsibility for conducting and supporting research on brain and nervous system disorders, including myasthenia gravis.''Much has been learned about myasthenia gravis in recent years. Technological advances have led to more timely and accurate diagnosis, and new and enhanced therapies have improved management of the disorder. There is a greater understanding about the structure and function of the neuromuscular junction, the fundamental aspects of the thymus gland and of autoimmunity, and the disorder itself. Despite these advances, however, there is still much to learn. Researchers are seeking to learn what causes the autoimmune response in myasthenia gravis, and to better define the relationship between the thymus gland and myasthenia gravis.''Different drugs are being tested, either alone or in combination with existing drug therapies, to see if they are effective in treating myasthenia gravis. One study is examining the use of ''methotrexate'' therapy in individuals who develop symptoms and signs of the disease while on prednisone therapy. The drug suppresses blood cell activity that causes inflammation. Another study is investigating the use of ''rituximab'', a monoclonal antibody against B cells which make antibodies, to see if it decreases certain antibodies that cause the immune system to attack the nervous system. Investigators are also determining if eculizumab is safe and effective in treating individuals with generalized myasthenia gravis who also receive various immunosuppressant drugs.''Another study seeks further understanding of the molecular basis of synaptic transmission in the nervous system. The objective of this study is to expand current knowledge of the function of receptors and to apply this knowledge to the treatment of myasthenia gravis.''Thymectomy is also being studied in myasthenia gravis patients who do not have thymoma to assess long-term benefit the surgical procedure may have over medical therapy alone.''One study involves blood sampling to see if the immune system is making antibodies against components of the nerves and muscle. Researchers also hope to learn if these antibodies contribute to the development or worsening of myasthenia gravis and other illnesses of the nervous system.''Investigators are also examining the safety and efficacy of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to treat refractory and severe myasthenia gravis. Participants in this study will receive several days of treatment using the immumosuppressant drugs ''cyclophosphamide'' and antithymocyte globulin before having some of their peripheral blood cells harvested and frozen. The blood cells will later be thawed and infused intravenously into the respective individuals, whose symptoms will be monitored for five years.' "

What is Mycobacterium marinum?,"'Mycobacterium marinum'' (''M. marinum'') is a slow-growing atypical mycobacterium that is commonly found in bodies of fresh or saltwater in many parts of the world. Skin infections with ''Mycobacterium marinum'' in humans are relatively uncommon and are usually acquired from contact with contents of aquariums or fish. Most infections occur following skin exposure to the bacteria through a small cut or skin scrape. The first signs of infection with ''M. marinum'' include a reddish or tan ''skin bump'' called a granuloma. Less commonly, a string or batch of the small reddish ''bumps'' crop up on the exposed body area in a classic pattern called sporotrichotic lymphangitis.''It is somewhat rare to acquire this infection from well-maintained ''swimming'' pools because of protection afforded by proper chlorination. ''Mycobacterium marinum'' does not typically grow at normal body temperature, which is why it remains localized to the cooler skin surface. Overall, diagnosis and treatment of this unusual ''skin infection'' is often delayed because of a lack of suspicion for this atypical mycobacterium versus more common bacteria like ''Staphylococcus''.' "
What are other names for Mycobacterium marinum infections?,"'Some synonyms for ''Mycobacterium marinum'' skin infections include tropical fish granuloma, fish tank granuloma and fish tank granuloma.' "
How common is Mycobacterium marinum?,"'Although rare, infections can occur worldwide, most commonly in individuals with occupational and recreational exposure to fresh or saltwater. In the United States, infections caused by ''M. marinum'' are rare. The infection is very rare in children and is typically a disease of adults, although any person, regardless of age, may become infected.'  "
How does a person get infected with Mycobacterium marinum?,"'Human infections with ''M. marinum'' under normal circumstances are rare. People are prone to this infection when there is minor ''trauma'' to an extremity like the forearm before or during contact with marine animals like fish or turtles, or just an aquarium, saltwater or freshwater.''However, people who have minor breaks in the skin such as small ''cuts'' or ''scrapes'' are at increased risk''One form of the infection, known as ""swimming pool granuloma,"" can occur when there is inadequate chlorination of swimming pools. However, in the U.S., most human infections with this bacteria have been associated with contact with fish tanks.' when in contact with water from an aquarium or fish tank, when handling, cleaning, or processing fish, while swimming or working in fresh or salt water, or while standing in contaminated water."
Are Mycobacterium marinum infections contagious?,'M. marinum'' infection is not ''contagious''; it is not spread from person to person. It is also not transmitted in hospitals like other common bacteria.' 
"Who is at risk for Mycobacterium marinum 
infection?","'People at highest risk include home-aquarium hobbyists, swimmers, aquarium workers, marine-life handlers, anglers, and oyster workers. Overall, anyone with frequent or persistent saltwater or freshwater exposure is at potential risk. Here is a list of at risk people:' personal home-aquarium owners professionals who clean aquariums marine biologists fishermen and workers exposed to saltwater fish immunocompromised patients (HIV/AIDS)"
What are the symptoms of Mycobacterium marinum infection?,"'Typically, patients may initially notice a small red bump or non-healing red sore on their skin a few weeks after a history of exposure to non-chlorinated water. Ninety percent of the cases involve the arms (upper extremities). They may remember getting a scratch, scrape, or puncture ''wound'' several weeks before while in the water. Many people may easily overlook the early signs and try ''over-the-counter'' antibiotic creams and disinfectants on their own in an attempt to make the bump or sore go away. Often, patients may not decide to go to their physician until they can\'t get rid of the bump for weeks or months, when they see more bumps, or when they see spreading bumps in a ""line"" pattern up their arm or leg.''Some patients may feel no ''pain'' or ''itch'' while others commonly have some localized ''pain'' and firmness at the site of the infection. Most otherwise healthy people overall feel well during the infection and do not have ''fever'' or ''chills''.''Patients in poor health or those with other health issues like an impaired immune system or other serious illnesses may experience ''fever'', enlarged localized ''lymph nodes'', and systemic infection.''When ''M. marinum'' infects the skin, it causes localized microscopic nodules to form. These nodules are called granulomas. They occur at sites of skin trauma where there are scratches, cuts, and the like.''The granulomas slowly increase in size usually become visible within two to three weeks of exposure. Some reported cases have developed two to four months or more after exposure to ''M. marinum'' because of the very slow-growing nature of this bacterium.''The most frequent sign is a slowly developing nodule (raised bump) at the site the bacteria entered the body. Frequently, the nodule is on the hand or upper arm. Later the nodule can become an enlarging sore (an ulcer). Swelling of nearby lymph nodes occurs. Multiple granulomas may form in a line along the lymphatic vessel that drains the site. These lesions will usually spontaneously heal in several months. This infection can also involve the joints (''septic arthritis'') and bones (''osteomyelitis'').''A health-care provider should be consulted if a skin nodule or reddened sore (ulcer) develops following direct skin contact with fresh or saltwater or after handling or processing fish.''For people with compromise of the immune system, ''M. marinum'' infection can be especially serious and involve disseminated (widespread) disease. If an infection is suspected under such circumstances, a health-care provider should be promptly consulted.'  "
What specialists treat Mycobacterium marinum infections?,"'Many people who have skin infections will seek care from a primary-care physician, including family practitioners or internists, or a dermatologist. For severe cases, an infectious-disease specialist may be consulted. If the patient seeks care at an emergency department or urgent-care facility, he or she may be treated by a specialist in ''emergency medicine''.' "
What tests are available to diagnose a Mycobacterium marinum infection?,"'Lab tests include cultures where a swab or sample is taken and grown in the laboratory. Cultures of ''M. marinum'"" are fairly difficult to grow and usually may take several weeks in the lab. The culture may be negative, even if there is an active infection. Treatment may still be considered even if the test results are negative, especially if the patient's history supports past fish or fish-tank exposure.""'In the absence of positive culture results, a skin or tissue biopsy may be a helpful test for diagnosis. This may help find the microscopic bacteria.''A special test called ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR'') of tissue may be used in difficult cases to assist in naming the exact type of bacteria or Mycobacterium species involved.' "
Do fish get infected with Mycobacterium marinum?,"'Yes. There are probably two different types of ''M. marinum''. One type only causes a longstanding (chronic) progressive disease in fish without affecting humans. The second type, which can infect humans, seems to cause a deadly sudden illness in fish.' "
What is the treatment for a Mycobacterium marinum infection?,"'Most infections are treated medically with a fairly long course of oral antibiotics. The length of the course of antibiotics varies. Medications may be required anywhere from three to six months or even up to 18 months depending on the severity of the disease and spread of the infection. Typically, physicians may recommend continuing the medications for an additional four to six weeks even after all of the symptoms have fully cleared.''The gold standard for treatment of infection by ''M. marinum'' is oral antibiotics. ''Clarithromycin'' with ''ethambutol'' is currently the preferred antibiotic selection. Rifampin is typically added to the antibiotics regimen if deeper organ infection is present, such as bone infection (osteomyelitis).''Some milder infections (mainly in healthy people) have cleared on their own without any treatment. Rarely, surgical treatment and drainage of deeper tissue or skin infections may become necessary in more complicated cases. However, medical treatment remains the primary and preferred treatment for nearly all cases.'  "
What is the prognosis for those infected with Mycobacterium marinum?,"'The prognosis is excellent for a complete cure with a proper, full course of oral antibiotics and good medical follow-up with your physician. There are no long-term problems after treatment.' "
What are possible complications from Mycobacterium marinum?,"'M. marinum'"" infections are usually localized and typically do not spread past the skin in healthy people. Most patients with a normal immune system don't experience other complications. However, undetected or untreated, the infection may progress and cause deeper and more longstanding infections. Some rare potential problems include infection of the underlying bone called osteomyelitis, infection of the deep muscle tendons called tenosynovitis, inflammation of the joints called ""'arthritis'', and widespread bodily infections called disseminated disease. Patients with an impaired immune system (immunocompromised) may be much more prone to these more serious complications.' "
What else could it be?,"'Other conditions may mimic or be confused with ''M. marinum'' infections. Possible other diagnoses include common things like ''bug bites'', ''spider bites'', foreign body granuloma, ''bacterial infections'' like ''staph'' or ''E. coli'', ''fungal infections'', tumors, and others. Additional diagnoses include cowpox infection, ''leishmaniasis'', ''leprosy'', ''sarcoidosis'', and ''sporotrichosis''. More advanced cases may be mistaken for ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''gout'', traumatic tendon injury, deep fungal infections, or ''cancer''.' "
How can I prevent this infection?,"'The following steps may help to protect you from contracting an infection with ''M. marinum'':' Avoid fresh or saltwater activities if there are open cuts, scrapes, or sores on your skin, especially in bodies of water where this bacterium is known to exist. If you have a weakened immune system, you can reduce the risk of infection by carefully covering cuts, scrapes, or sores during fresh or saltwater activities and while cleaning fish tanks or handling, cleaning, or processing fish. Wear heavy gloves (leather or heavy cotton) while cleaning or processing fish, especially fish with sharp spines that may cause cuts, scratches, or sores to the hands and skin. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after fish processing or use a waterless cleanser. Wear waterproof gloves while cleaning home aquariums or fish tanks. Wash hands and forearms thoroughly with soap and running water after cleaning the tank, even if gloves were worn. Ensure regular and adequate chlorination of swimming pools to kill any bacteria that may be present."
Myocardial Biopsy Introduction,"'A ''heart'' biopsy, also called myocardial biopsy or cardiac biopsy, is an invasive procedure to detect ''heart disease'' that involves using a bioptome (a small catheter with a grasping device on the end) to obtain a small piece of heart muscle tissue that is sent to a laboratory for analysis.' "
Why Do I Need a Myocardial Biopsy?,'Your doctor uses myocardial biopsy to:' Evaluate or confirm the presence of rejection after heart transplant. Diagnose myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or certain other cardiac disorders such as cardiomyopathy or cardiac amyloidosis.
How Should I Prepare for a Heart Biopsy?,"'To prepare yourself for a heart biopsy you should know these things:' The procedure takes place in the hospital. Usually, you will come to the hospital the day of the test and it is performed as an outpatient procedure. In some cases, you may need to be admitted to the hospital the night before the procedure. You can wear whatever you like to the hospital, but it is a good idea to leave valuables, such as jewelry, at home. You will wear a hospital gown during the procedure. Your doctor or nurse will give you specific instructions about what you can and cannot eat or drink before the procedure. In general, food and fluids are restricted for 6 to 8 hours before the test. Ask your doctor what medications should be taken on the day of your heart biopsy. Be sure to tell your doctor if you are taking any nutrition supplements or herbal preparations, and tell your doctor which over-the-counter medications you are taking. Please bring a list of all of your medications and the current dosages with you. If you have diabetes, ask your doctor how to adjust your medications the day of your test. Tell your doctor and/or nurses if you are allergic to anything. Arrange for someone to drive you home after the test. If you normally wear dentures or a hearing device, plan to wear them during the procedure to help with communication. If you wear glasses, plan to bring them as well."
What Can I Expect During a Heart Biopsy?," A health care provider will explain the heart biopsy to you, including the potential risks. After you change into a hospital gown, a nurse will start an intravenous (IV) line in your arm so that medications and fluids can be given during the procedure. You will lie on your back on a special table. If you look above, you will see a large camera and several TV monitors. A mild sedative medication will be given before the procedure to help you relax, but you will be awake during the procedure. The doctor will use a local anesthetic to numb the area of your neck. A plastic introducer sheath (a short, hollow tube through which the catheter is placed) is inserted through a small incision and into a blood vessel in the neck. A bioptome is inserted through the sheath and threaded to the right ventricle. X-rays, called fluoroscopy, are used to position the bioptome properly. The bioptome is used to obtain samples of the heart muscle. Each sample is about the size of the head (top) of a pin. When the samples have been collected, the catheter and sheath will be removed and firm pressure will be held over the area to stop bleeding. The procedure takes about 30 to 60 minutes. However, the preparation and recovery add several hours. You should be able to go home the same day of the procedure."
What Can I Expect After a Heart Biopsy?,"'After a heart biopsy, firm pressure will be held over the area where the catheter was inserted to stop the bleeding. You will be monitored for a few hours after the procedure.''Before you go home, a health care provider will tell you how to care for the ''wound'' site and when you can return to your regular activities.''A responsible adult must drive you home after the procedure. The medication given during the procedure makes it unsafe for you to drive or operate machinery.''When the results of the heart biopsy are available, your doctor will discuss them with you.''Please ask your doctor if you have any questions about heart biopsy.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is a heart attack?,"'A heart attack (also known as a myocardial infarction or MI) is the damage and death of heart muscle from the sudden blockage of a coronary artery by a blood clot. Coronary arteries are blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood and oxygen. Blockage of a coronary artery deprives the heart muscle of blood and oxygen, causing injury to the heart muscle. Injury to the heart muscle causes chest ''pain'' and chest pressure sensation. If blood flow is not restored to the heart muscle within 20 to 40 minutes, irreversible death of the heart muscle will begin to occur. Muscle continues to die for six to eight hours at which time the heart attack usually is ""complete."" The dead heart muscle is eventually replaced by ''scar tissue''.' "
What causes a heart attack?,"'Atherosclerosis is a gradual process by which plaques (collections) of cholesterol are deposited in the walls of arteries. Cholesterol plaques cause the hardening of the arterial walls and narrowing of the inner channel (lumen) of the artery. Arteries that are narrowed by atherosclerosis cannot deliver enough blood to maintain the normal function of the parts of the body they supply. For example, atherosclerosis of the arteries in the legs causes reduced blood flow to the legs. Reduced blood flow to the legs can lead to ''pain'' in the legs while ''walking'' or exercising leg ulcers, or a delay in the healing of wounds to the legs. Atherosclerosis of the arteries that furnish blood to the brain can lead to ''vascular dementia'' (mental deterioration due to gradual death of brain tissue over many years) or ''stroke'' (sudden damage and death of brain tissue).''In many people, atherosclerosis can remain silent (causing no symptoms or health problems) for years or decades. Atherosclerosis can begin as early as the teenage years, but symptoms or health problems usually do not arise until later in adulthood when the arterial narrowing becomes severe. ''Smoking'' cigarettes, ''high blood pressure'', elevated cholesterol, and ''diabetes mellitus'' can accelerate atherosclerosis and lead to the earlier onset of symptoms and complications, particularly in those people who have a family history of early atherosclerosis.''Coronary atherosclerosis'' (or ''coronary artery disease'') refers to the atherosclerosis that causes hardening and narrowing of the coronary arteries. Diseases caused by the reduced blood supply to the heart muscle from coronary atherosclerosis are called coronary heart diseases (CHD). Coronary heart diseases include heart attacks, sudden unexpected death, chest pain (''angina''), ''abnormal heart rhythms'', and heart failure due to weakening of the heart muscle.''Angina pectoris'' (also referred to as angina) is chest pain or pressure that occurs when the blood and oxygen supply to the heart muscle cannot keep up with the needs of the muscle. When coronary arteries are narrowed by more than 50 to 70 percent, the arteries may not be able to increase the supply of blood to the heart muscle during ''exercise'' or other periods of high demand for oxygen. An insufficient supply of oxygen to the heart muscle causes angina. Angina that occurs with exercise or exertion is called ''exertional angina.'' In some patients, especially in people with ''diabetes'', the progressive decrease in blood flow to the heart may occur without any pain or with just shortness of breath or unusually early ''fatigue''.''Exertional angina usually feels like a pressure, heaviness, squeezing, or aching across the chest. This pain may travel to the neck, jaw, arms, back, or even the ''teeth'', and may be accompanied by shortness of breath, ''nausea'', or a ''cold'' sweat. Exertional angina typically lasts from one to 15 minutes and usually is relieved by rest or by placing a tablet of ''nitroglycerin'"" under the tongue. Both resting and nitroglycerin decrease the heart muscle's demand for oxygen, thus relieving angina. Exertional angina may be the first warning sign of advanced ""'coronary artery disease''. Chest pains that just last a few seconds rarely are due to coronary artery disease.'""Angina also can occur at rest. Angina at rest more commonly indicates that a coronary artery has narrowed to such a critical degree that the heart is not receiving enough oxygen even at rest. Angina at rest infrequently may be due to the spasm of a coronary artery (a condition called Prinzmetal's or variant angina). Unlike a heart attack, there is no permanent muscle damage with either exertional or rest angina although the angina is a warning sign that there is an increased chance of a heart attack in the future.""'Occasionally the surface of a cholesterol plaque in a coronary artery may rupture, and a blood clot forms on the surface of the plaque. The clot blocks the flow of blood through the artery and results in a heart attack (see picture below). The cause of rupture that leads to the formation of a clot is largely unknown, but contributing factors may include ''cigarette smoking'' or other ''nicotine'' exposure, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, elevated levels of blood catecholamines (adrenaline), ''high blood pressure'', and other mechanical and biochemical stimuli.''Unlike exertional or rest angina, heart muscle dies during a heart attack and loss of the muscle is permanent, unless blood flow can be promptly restored, usually within one to six hours.''While heart attacks can occur at any time, more heart attacks occur between 4 A.M. and 10 A.M. because of the higher blood levels of adrenaline released from the adrenal glands during the morning hours. Increased adrenaline, as previously discussed, may contribute to the rupture of cholesterol plaques.''Only half of the patients who develop heart attacks have warning signs such as exertional angina or rest angina prior to their heart attacks, but these signs may be mild and ignored as unimportant.' "
What are the symptoms of a heart attack?,"'Although chest pain or pressure is the most common symptom of a heart attack, heart attack victims may experience a variety of conditions including:''Even though the symptoms of a heart attack at times can be vague and mild, it is important to remember that heart attacks producing no symptoms or only mild symptoms can be just as serious and life-threatening as heart attacks that cause severe chest pain. Too often patients attribute heart attack symptoms to ""''indigestion'',"" ""''fatigue'',"" or ""''stress'',"" and consequently delay seeking prompt medical attention. ''One cannot overemphasize the importance of seeking prompt medical attention in the presence of new symptoms that suggest a heart attack. Early diagnosis and treatment saves lives, and delays in reaching medical assistance can be fatal.'' A delay in treatment can lead to permanently reduced function of the heart due to more extensive damage to the heart muscle. Death also may occur as a result of the sudden onset of arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation.'

Silent heart attacks are especially common among patients with diabetes mellitus.)"
What are the complications of a heart attack?,"'When a large amount of heart muscle dies, the ability of the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body is diminished, and this can result in heart failure. The body retains fluid, and organs, for example, the kidneys, begin to fail.''Injury to heart muscle also can lead to ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation occurs when the normal, regular, electrical activation of heart muscle contraction is replaced by chaotic electrical activity that causes the heart to stop beating and pumping blood to the brain and other parts of the body. Permanent ''brain damage'' and death can occur unless the flow of blood to the brain is restored within five minutes.''Most of the deaths from heart attacks are caused by ventricular fibrillation of the heart that occurs before the victim of the heart attack can reach an emergency room. Those who reach the emergency room have an excellent prognosis; survival from a heart attack with modern treatment should exceed 90%. The 1% to 10% of heart attack victims who later die frequently had suffered major damage to the heart muscle initially or additional damage at a later time.''Deaths from ventricular fibrillation can be avoided by ''cardiopulmonary resuscitation'' (CPR) started within five minutes of the onset of ventricular fibrillation. CPR requires ''breathing'' for the victim and applying external compression to the chest to squeeze the heart and force it to pump blood. In 2008, the American Heart Association modified the mouth-to-mouth instruction of CPR, and recommends that chest compressions alone are effective if a bystander is reluctant to do mouth-to-mouth. When paramedics arrive, medications and/or an electrical ''shock'' (''cardioversion'') can be administered to convert ventricular fibrillation back to a normal heart rhythm and allow the heart to pump blood normally. Therefore, prompt CPR and a rapid response by paramedics can improve the chances of survival from a heart attack. In addition, many public venues now have automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) that provide the electrical shock needed to restore a normal heart rhythm even before the paramedics arrive. This greatly improves the chances of survival.' "
What are the risk factors for atherosclerosis and heart attack?,"'Factors that increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart attacks include increased blood cholesterol, ''high blood pressure'', use of tobacco, diabetes mellitus, male gender (although women may still be very much at risk -- see section at end of article), and a family history of coronary ''heart disease''. While family history and male gender are genetically determined, the other risk factors can be modified through changes in lifestyle and medications.''The cholesterol that is combined with low-density lipoproteins (''LDL cholesterol'') is the ""bad"" cholesterol that deposits cholesterol in arterial plaques. Thus, elevated levels of ''LDL cholesterol'' are associated with an increased risk of heart attack.''The cholesterol that is combined with HDL (''HDL cholesterol'') is the ""good"" cholesterol that removes cholesterol from arterial plaques. Thus, low levels of ''HDL cholesterol'' are associated with an increased risk of heart attacks.''Measures that lower LDL cholesterol and/or increase HDL cholesterol (losing excess weight, diets low in saturated ''fats'', regular exercise, and medications) have been shown to lower the risk of heart attack. One important class of medications for treating elevated cholesterol levels (the ''statins'') have actions in addition to lowering LDL cholesterol which also protect against heart attack. Most patients at ""high risk"" for a heart attack should be on a statin no matter what the levels of their cholesterol.' High Blood Cholesterol (Hyperlipidemia). A high level of cholesterol in the blood is associated with an increased heart attack risk because cholesterol is the major component of the plaques deposited in arterial walls. Cholesterol, like oil, cannot dissolve in the blood unless it is combined with special proteins called lipoproteins. (Without combining with lipoproteins, cholesterol in the blood would turn into a solid substance.) The cholesterol in blood is either combined with lipoproteins as very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL) or high-density lipoproteins (HDL). High Blood Pressure (Hypertension). High blood pressure is a risk factor for developing atherosclerosis and heart attack. Both high systolic pressure (the blood pressure as the heart contracts) and high diastolic pressure (the blood pressure as the heart relaxes) increase the risk of heart attack. It has been shown that controlling hypertension with medications can reduce the risk of heart attack. Tobacco Use (Smoking). Tobacco and tobacco smoke contain chemicals that cause damage to blood vessel walls, accelerate the development of atherosclerosis, and increase the risk of heart attack. Diabetes (Diabetes Mellitus). Both insulin dependent and noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2, respectively) are associated with accelerated atherosclerosis throughout the body. Therefore, patients with diabetes mellitus are at higher risk for reduced blood flow to the legs, coronary heart disease, erectile dysfunction, and strokes at an earlier age than nondiabetic subjects. Patients with diabetes can lower their risk through rigorous control of their blood sugar levels, regular exercise, weight control, and proper diets. Male Gender. Men are more likely to suffer heart attacks than women if they are less than 75 years old. Above age 75, women are as likely as men to have heart attacks. Family History of Heart Disease. Individuals with a family history of coronary heart diseases have an increased risk of heart attack. Specifically, the risk is higher if there is a family history of early coronary heart disease, including a heart attack or sudden death before age 55 in the father or other first-degree male relative, or before age 65 in the mother or other female first-degree female relative."
How to diagnose a heart attack,"'When there is severe chest pain, suspicion that a heart attack is occurring usually is high, and tests can be performed quickly that will confirm the heart attack. A problem arises, however, when the symptoms of a heart attack do not include chest pain. A heart attack may not be suspected, and the appropriate tests may not be performed. Therefore, the initial step in diagnosing a heart attack is to be suspicious that one has occurred so that the appropriate tests can be done.''Electrocardiogram''.'' An electrocardiogram (''ECG'"") is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart. Abnormalities in the electrical activity usually occur with heart attacks and can identify the areas of heart muscle that are deprived of oxygen and/or areas of muscle that have died. In a patient with typical symptoms of heart attack (such as crushing chest pain) and characteristic changes of heart attack on the ECG, a secure diagnosis of heart attack can be made quickly in the emergency room and treatment can be started immediately. If a patient's symptoms are vague or atypical and if there are pre-existing ECG abnormalities, for example, from old heart attacks or abnormal electrical patterns that make interpretation of the ECG difficult, the diagnosis of a heart attack may be less secure. In these patients, the diagnosis can be made only hours later through blood tests.""'Blood tests.'' Cardiac enzymes are proteins that are released into the blood by dying heart muscles. These cardiac enzymes are creatine phosphokinase (CPK), special sub-fractions of CPK (specifically, the MB fraction of CPK), and troponin, and their levels can be measured in blood. These cardiac enzymes typically are elevated in the blood several hours after the onset of a heart attack. Currently, troponin levels are considered the preferred lab tests to use to help diagnose a heart attack, as they are indicators of ''cardiac muscle'' injury or death. A series of blood tests for the enzymes performed over a 24-hour period are useful not only in confirming the diagnosis of heart attack, but the changes in their levels over time also correlates with the amount of heart muscle that has died.''The most important factor in diagnosing and treating a heart attack is prompt medical attention.'' Rapid evaluation allows early treatment of potentially life-threatening abnormal rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation and allows early reperfusion (return of blood flow to the heart muscle) by procedures that unclog the blocked coronary arteries. The more rapidly blood flow is reestablished, the more heart muscle that is saved. At this time, mechanical reperfusion with ''angioplasty'' and/or stenting to increase the flow of blood to the heart is the preferred way to preserve heart muscle if it can be performed within 90 minutes of arrival to the hospital; if there will be a delay, thrombolytic agents (clot busters) are preferred.''Large and active medical centers often have a ""chest pain unit"" where patients suspected of having heart attacks are rapidly evaluated. If a heart attack is diagnosed, prompt therapy is initiated. If the diagnosis of heart attack is initially unclear, the patient is placed under continuous monitoring until the results of further testing are available.'  "
What is the treatment for heart attack?,"'The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) task force recommends a treatment guideline that they consider as a preferred strategy to treat heart attacks; PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) or stenting is emphasized. For details about PCI, please see reference 2.''The 2013 ACCF/AHA guidelines for treatment of a heart attack are summarized as follows:'   Ideally, transport patient to a PCI capable hospital; if not PCI capable, transfer patient as soon as possible and less than 120 min; if anticipated transfer is more than 120 min, give fibrinolytic agent within 30 min of arrival Send to cath lab Diagnostic angiogram PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) also termed stenting or stent placement If reocclusion occurs or perfusion fails in a patient given a fibrinolytic, arrange transfer to a PCI capable facility; for other patients treated with a fibrinolytic, transfer to a PCI facility within about 3-24hrs If step 5 occurs, step 3 should follow at a PCI capable facility were either medical therapy, a PCI or a CABG should be done Patients who are not candidates for PCI therapy usually undergo medical or surgical (CABG) therapy. For a more detailed presentation of the medical treatments and CABG, read the heart attack treatment article."
What are the risk factors for heart attack in women?,"'Coronary artery disease (''CAD'') and heart attacks are erroneously believed to occur primarily in men. Although it is true that the prevalence of CAD among women is lower before ''menopause'', the risk of CAD rises in women after ''menopause'"". At age 75, a woman's risk for CAD is equal to that of a man's. CAD is the leading cause of death and disability in women after ""'menopause''. In fact, a 50-year-old woman faces a 46% risk of developing CAD and a 31% risk of dying from coronary artery disease. In contrast, her probability of contracting and dying from ''breast cancer'' is 12% and 3%, respectively.''The risk factors for developing CAD in women are the same as in men and include:''Even ""light"" smoking raises the risk of CAD. In one study, middle-aged women who smoked one to 14 cigarettes per day had a twofold increase in strokes (caused by atherosclerosis of the arteries to the brain) whereas those who smoked more than 25 cigarettes per day had a risk of ''stroke'' 3.7 fold higher than that of nonsmoking women. Furthermore, the combination of smoking and the use of ''birth control pills'' increase the risk of heart attacks even further, especially in women over 35.''Quitting smoking immediately begins to reduce the risk of heart attacks. The risk gradually returns to the same risk of nonsmoking women after several years of not smoking.''Current NCEP (National Cholesterol Education Program) treatment guidelines for undesirable cholesterol levels are the same for women as for men.' increased blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking cigarettes, diabetes mellitus, and a family history of coronary heart disease at a young age."
What are the symptoms of heart attack in women and how is heart attack diagnosed?,"'Women are more likely to encounter delays in establishing the diagnosis of heart attack than men. This is in part because women tend to seek medical care later than men, and in part because diagnosing ''heart attacks in women'' can sometimes be more difficult than diagnosing heart attacks in men. The reasons include:''Because of the atypical nature of symptoms and the occasional difficulties in diagnosing heart attacks in women, women are less likely to receive aggressive thrombolytic therapy or coronary angioplasty, and are more likely to receive it later than men. Women also are less likely to be admitted to a coronary care unit.' Women are more likely than men to have atypical heart attack symptoms such as:neck and shoulder pain,abdominal pain,nausea,vomiting,fatigue, andshortness of breath. neck and shoulder pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Silent heart attacks (heart attacks with little or no symptoms) are more common among women than among men. Women have a higher occurrence than men of chest pain that is not caused by heart disease, for example chest pain from spasm of the esophagus. Women are less likely than men to have the typical findings on the ECG that are necessary to diagnose a heart attack quickly. Women are more likely than men to have angina (chest pain due to lack of blood supply to the heart muscle) that is caused by spasm of the coronary arteries or caused by disease of the smallest blood vessels (microvasculature disease). Cardiac catheterization with coronary angiograms (X-ray studies of the coronary arteries that are considered the most reliable tests for CAD) will reveal normal coronary arteries and therefore cannot be used to diagnose either of these two conditions. Women are more likely to have misleading, or ""false positive"" noninvasive tests for CAD then men that don't disclose the arterial disease that is present."
How is heart attack in women treated?,"'Thrombolytic (fibrinolytic or clot dissolving) therapy has been shown to reduce death from heart attacks similarly in men and women; however, the complication of strokes from the thrombolytic therapy may be slightly higher in women than in men.'""Emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary stenting for acute heart attack is as effective in women as in men; however women may have a slightly higher rate of procedure-related complications in their blood vessels (such as bleeding or clotting at the point of insertion of the PTCA catheter in the groin) and death. This higher rate of complications has been attributed to women's older age, smaller artery size, and greater severity of angina. The long-term outcome of angioplasty or stenting however, is similar in men and women, and should not be withheld due to gender. This is still the preferred mode of therapy if it can be performed in a timely fashion.""'The immediate mortality from ''coronary artery bypass graft'"" surgery (CABG) in women is higher than that for men. The higher immediate mortality rate has been attributed to women's older age, smaller artery size, and greater severity of angina (the same as for PTCA). Long-term survival, rate of recurrent heart attack and/or need for reoperation, however, are similar in men and women after CABG."" "
What about hormone therapy and heart attack in women?,"'After menopause, the production of estrogen by the ovaries gradually diminishes over several years. Along with this reduction, there is an increase in LDL (""bad"" cholesterol) and a small decrease in HDL (""good"" cholesterol). These changes in ''lipid'' levels are believed to be one of the reasons for the increased risks of developing CAD after menopause. Women who have had their ovaries surgically removed (''oophorectomy'') or experience an early menopause, also have an accelerated risk of CAD.''Since treatment with estrogen hormone results in higher HDL and lower LDL cholesterol levels, doctors thought for many years that estrogen would protect women against CAD (as well protect against ''dementia'' and ''stroke''). Many studies have found that ''postmenopausal'' women who take estrogen have lower CAD rates than women who do not. Unfortunately many of the studies were observational studies (studies in which women are followed over time but decide on their own whether or not they wish to take estrogen). Observational studies have serious shortcomings because they are subject to selection bias; for example, women who choose to take estrogen hormones may be healthier and have a lower risk of heart attacks than those who do not. In other words, something else in the daily habits of women who take estrogen (such as exercise or healthier ''diet'') may make them less likely to develop heart attacks. Therefore, only a randomized trial (a study in which women agree to be assigned to estrogen or a placebo or ''sugar'' pill at random but are not told which pills they took until the end of the study) can establish whether ''hormone therapy'' after menopause can prevent CAD.''The Heart and ''Estrogen/progestin'' Replacement Study (HERS), was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of the effect of the daily use of ''estrogens'' plus ''medroxyprogesterone'' (progestin) on the rate of heart attacks in postmenopausal women who already had CAD. The HERS trial did not find a reduction in heart attacks in women who took hormone therapy. This lack of benefit in preventing heart attacks occurred despite an 11% lower LDL and a 10% higher HDL cholesterol level in the women treated with hormones. The study also found that more women in the hormone-treated group experienced ''blood clots'' in the veins and ''gallbladder disease'' than women in the placebo-treated group. (Blood clots in the veins are dangerous because these clots can travel to the ''lungs'' and cause ''pulmonary embolism'', a condition with chest pain, shortness of breath, and even shock and death.) However, the increase in gallbladder disease and blood clots among healthy users of estrogen who do not have heart disease is very small.''Based on the results of this study, researchers concluded that estrogen is not effective in preventing coronary artery disease and heart attacks in postmenopausal women who already have CAD. It should be noted, however, that the results of the HERS trial only apply to women who have known CAD prior to starting hormone therapy and not to women without known coronary artery disease.''The '""Women's Health""' Initiative (WHI) was the first randomized controlled trial designed to determine the long-term benefits and risks of treatment with estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone (progestin) in healthy menopausal women (women without CAD). The results were reported in a series of articles in 2002, 2003, and 2004. The estrogen + progestin portion of the WHI study had to be stopped earlier than planned, after just 5.2 years, because the increase in coronary heart disease, ''stroke'', and ''pulmonary embolism'' among women who use estrogen + ''progesterone'' outweighed the benefits of reduced bone ''fractures'' and ''colon cancer''. The estrogen-alone portion of the WHI was stopped because women who took estrogen alone had no reduction in heart attack risk, yet there was a significant increase in stroke risk.''An increase in ''breast cancer'' became apparent after three to five years, but the increase in heart disease and pulmonary emboli occurred early on, in the first year.''MedicineNet Medical Editors believe that:' Decisions regarding use of hormone therapy have to be individualized, and all women should discuss with their physicians what is best for them. Estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone (progestin) is still the best therapy for hot flashes. Despite the WHI study, many women remain good candidates for estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone (progestin) therapy (or estrogen alone if they have had hysterectomy). This is especially true if hormone therapy is limited to the shortest duration, optimally less than five years. Estrogens with or without medroxyprogesterone (progestin) should not be used to prevent or treat either Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, or stroke. While estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone (progestin) are effective in preventing osteoporosis and related bone fractures, women concerned about the risk of hormone therapy should discuss their concerns with their doctors, the use of other nonhormonal alternatives to prevent and treat osteoporosis."
What is new in heart attack?,"'Greater public awareness about heart attacks and changes in lifestyle have contributed to a dramatic reduction in the incidence of heart attacks during the last four decades. The role of the ""super aspirins"" (abciximab [''Reopro''] and eptifibatide [''Integrilin'']) has been established to be of benefit in selected patients.''More effective versions of clot-busting drugs have been developed. Increasingly, paramedics can do ECGs in the field, diagnose a heart attack, and take patients directly to hospitals that have the ability to do PTCA and stenting. This can save time and reduce damage to the heart. At present, the accepted best treatment for a heart attack is identification promptly of the diagnosis, and transport to a hospital that can perform prompt catheterization and PTCA or stenting within the first 90 minutes of the cardiac event (see 2013 guidelines above).''Recent data has shown that lowering blood LDL levels even further than previously suggested may further decrease the risk of heart attacks.''Research also has shown that inflammation may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis, and this is an active area of current investigation. There also is early evidence that with genetic engineering it may be possible to develop a drug that can be administered to clear plaques from arteries (a ""scavenger molecule"").' "
What is myocarditis?,"'Myocarditis is inflammation of the ''heart'' muscle (''myocardium''). The inflammation of the heart muscle causes degeneration or death of heart muscle cells. Myocarditis has many different causes and can result in a range of outcomes from mild (presenting briefly and resolving) to rapidly progressing fatal disease. Myocarditis is differentiated from ''pericarditis'' because pericarditis is inflammation of the sac that surrounds the heart and does not involve heart muscle as myocarditis does. However, it is not unusual to have a patient present with both pericarditis and myocarditis.''There are many different types of myocarditis and a wide range of possible agents that can trigger the disease. Examples include:'   Viral: Coxsackie B virus, enterovirus, adenovirus, influenza, and many others Bacterial: Streptococci, meningococci, clostridia, Corynebacterium, mycobacteria, and many others Fungal and parasites: Candida, aspergillosis, Cryptococcus, schistosomes, filaria, malaria, toxoplasma, and many others Lymphocytic: Heart muscle infiltrated with lymphocytes Eosinophilic: Heart muscle infiltrated with eosinophils Autoimmune: Caused by autoimmune diseases, such as lupus Fulminant: Inflammatory process in the heart muscle that leads to acute severe heart failure Idiopathic: Inflammatory process in the heart muscle with no known cause Acute: Symptoms appear rapidly and usually decrease after week or two Chronic: Slow appearance of symptoms that last greater than two weeks"
What causes myocarditis?,"'The causative agents that damage myocardium include the following:''About half of the time, the triggering agent for myocardial inflammation is not known (idiopathic). This is especially true in pediatric population where the majority of patients are diagnosed with idiopathic myocarditis.' Cytotoxic effects of infecting agents like viruses, bacteria fungi, and/or parasites Immune response triggered by infecting agents and cytokines produced in the myocardium in response to infection or inflammation Chemicals released during myocardial cell death Autoimmune responses can also trigger myocardial inflammation Some medications and/or toxins such as clozapine, radiation therapy, arsenic, carbon monoxide, and many others Certain diseases like lupus, Wegener's granulomatosis, and others"
What are symptoms of myocarditis?,"'Myocarditis can be mild and cause virtually no noticeable symptoms. The most frequent symptom of myocarditis is ''pain in the chest''. Other symptoms are related to the underlying triggering cause, like infection or an autoimmune disorder. The following is a list of symptoms and signs of myocarditis:''Myocarditis in children and infants has more nonspecific symptoms:'   Chest pain or chest discomfort Shortness of breath Swelling and/or edema Liver congestion Abnormal heartbeat (palpitations) Sudden death (in young adults) Fever (usually associated with an infectious process) Malaise Poor appetite Abdominal pain Chronic cough Increasing difficulty breathing Fever Rash Diarrhea Joint pains"
How is myocarditis diagnosed?,"""Myocarditis is preliminarily diagnosed by detecting signs of irritation of heart muscle during the patient's history and physical exam. Blood tests for heart muscle enzymes (CPK levels) can be elevated. Electrical testing (""'EKG'') can suggest irritation of heart muscle and document irregular beating of the heart. Nuclear heart scan testing can show irregular areas of heart muscle. Other tests to help definitively diagnose myocarditis include chest ''X-rays'' to determine the size and shape of the heart, ''MRI'', and ''echocardiogram''. Sometimes ''cardiac catheterization'' with heart muscle biopsy (endomyocardial biopsy) may be done to definitively determine the likely underlying cause for the disease.' "
What is the treatment for myocarditis?,"'Often, myocarditis improves on its own without treatment with complete recovery. Sometimes, treatment of the underlying cause (such as ''bacterial infections'') can lead to complete recovery (for example, after antibiotics). Consequently, the diagnosis of the precise underlying cause of myocarditis can help in the optimal choice of treatment.'""However, in patients with more prolonged or more severe cases of myocarditis, individuals may need more specific medications or even hospitalization. Medications to reduce the heart's workload and/or reduce edema are commonly used to treat symptoms of myocarditis. They may include the following:""'Individuals with severe symptoms of myocarditis (heart failure, acute shortness of breath) may require other treatments such as IV medications and/or vascular assist devices (pumps that help a weak heart pump) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to help provide oxygen to the blood. Occasionally, patients may require a ''heart transplant''. Individuals who develop very irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) may need an implanted ''pacemaker''.'   Enalapril(Vasotec) Captopril (Capoten) Lisinopril (Zestril, Prinivil) Ramipril (Altace) Metoprolol (Lopressor) Carvedilol (Coreg) Furosemide (Lasix)"
What is the prognosis (outlook) for patients with myocarditis?,"'The prognosis for patients with acute myocarditis who rapidly recover is very good. Even patients that develop severe myocarditis can completely recover with mild or no complications. However, if damage to the heart muscle becomes chronic and/or progressive, the prognosis for the patient declines. Those who develop severely weakened heart muscle ''cardiomyopathy'' have a poorer prognosis.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of fibromyalgia?,"'Symptoms may begin after acute psychological ''stress'', physical ''trauma'', surgery, or other systemic infections. Sometimes, there may be no identifiable trigger.''A patient with fibromyalgia typically presents with the following:' Widespread pain: The pain is constant and dull, lasting for at least three months. The pain occurs throughout the body, on both sides of the body, and below and above the waist. Fatigue: Patients with fibromyalgia are always tired, and they even wake up feeling tired despite sleeping for long periods of time. The pain can even cause sleep disturbance. Patients also have other sleep disorders, such as restless leg syndrome (uncontrollable urge to move legs due to some uncomfortable sensations) and sleep apnea (temporary cessation of breathing during sleep). Cognitive difficulties: This is also referred to as “fibro fog.” Fibromyalgia affects the ability to focus and pay attention to mental tasks. "
What are the signs and symptoms of myofascial pain syndrome?,"'The common signs and symptoms of myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) include:' Deep pain in specific areas of the muscles, which worsens when the muscles affected get stretched or strained. There is muscle pain that worsens or fails to improve with time. Presence of painful and tender knots in the muscles. Pain increases in applying pressure on the knots. Stiffening of the muscles, decreasing flexibility, and reducing the range of motion. Mood changes. Insomnia (decreased sleep or inability to sleep)."
What causes fibromyalgia and MPS?,"'The exact causes of fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) are unknown, but various factors are found to play a role in their cause. These may include:' Genetics: Fibromyalgia and MPS has been found to run in families. There may be certain genetic mutations that increase the risk of disorder. Infections: Certain systemic illnesses may trigger or aggravate the condition. Physical or emotional trauma: Fibromyalgia and MPS can sometimes be triggered by acute psychological stress or physical trauma such as an accident. "
What are the risk factors for fibromyalgia?,"'Risk factors for fibromyalgia include:' Female sex: Fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) are more common in women than in men. Family history: Positive family history increases the risk. Other disorders: Other conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus can increase the risk."
How are fibromyalgia and MPS treated?,"'Treatment options for fibromyalgia include:' Painkillers: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) and Advil (ibuprofen) and prescription painkillers can help reduce symptoms. Narcotics are not usually used because they can lead to dependence and may worsen the pain over time. Antidepressants: Anti-depressants such as Cymbalta (duloxetine) and Savella (milnacipran) and muscle relaxants may be prescribed to help reduce pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. Anti-seizure medication: Medications used to treat epilepsy may be useful in reducing certain types of pain. Physical therapy: A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will improve your strength, flexibility, and stamina. Water-based exercises might be particularly helpful. Occupational therapy: An occupational therapist can help you make adjustments to your work area or the way you perform certain tasks that will cause less stress on your body. Stress management: Managing physical and emotional stress is essential in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Stress management techniques such as deep-breathing exercises, yoga, or meditation can help. Seeking help from a professional therapist may be required. Adequate sleep: Because fatigue is one of the characteristic presentations of fibromyalgia,  sufficient rest, and practicing good sleep hygiene is essential. Exercise and diet: Initially, exercise can increase pain, but exercising regularly reduces pain gradually. Exercises may include walking, swimming, biking, water aerobics, yoga, or dance. A physical therapist can help develop an exercise regimen. Eating a healthy, balanced diet and limiting caffeine intake is important in the management of fibromyalgia."
What happens if you go untreated for fibromyalgia and MPS?, 
What is an electromyogram?,"'An electromyogram (EMG) is a test that is used to record the electrical activity of muscles. When muscles are active, they produce an electrical current. This current is usually proportional to the level of the muscle activity. An EMG is also referred to as a myogram.''EMGs can be used to detect abnormal electrical activity of muscle that can occur in many diseases and conditions, including muscular dystrophy, inflammation of muscles, pinched nerves, peripheral nerve damage (damage to nerves in the arms and legs), ''amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'' (''ALS''), ''myasthenia gravis'', ''disc herniation'', and others.'  "
Why is an EMG test done?,"'An EMG is often performed when patients have unexplained muscle ''weakness''. The EMG helps to distinguish between muscle conditions in which the problem begins in the muscle and muscle weakness due to nerve disorders. The EMG can also be used to detect true weakness, as opposed to weakness from reduced use because of ''pain'' or lack of motivation. EMGs can also be used to isolate the level of nerve irritation or injury.'  "
How is an intramuscular EMG done?,"'A needle is inserted through the skin into the muscle. The electrical activity is detected by this needle (which serves as an electrode). The activity is displayed visually on an oscilloscope and may also be detected audibly with a speaker.''Since skeletal muscles are often large, several needle electrodes may need to be placed at various locations to obtain an informative EMG.''After placement of the electrode(s), the patient may be asked to contract the muscle (for example, to bend the leg).''The presence, size, and shape of the wave form (the action potential) produced on the oscilloscope provide information about the ability of the muscle to respond to nervous stimulation. Each muscle ''fiber'' that contracts produces an action potential. The size of the muscle fiber affects the rate (how frequently an action potential occurs) and the size (the amplitude) of the action potential.' "
Is an EMG painful?,"'Yes. There is some discomfort at the time the needle electrodes are inserted. They feel like shots (intramuscular injections), although nothing is injected during an EMG. Afterwards, the muscle may feel a little sore for up to a few days.'  "
How do you prepare for an intramuscular EMG?,"""For adults, no special preparation is needed. For infants and children, the physical and psychological preparation depends on the child's age, behavior, and prior experience. (For instance, has the child been traumatized by another medical or dental procedure?)"" "
What other test is done during an intramuscular EMG?,"""A nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test is often done at the same time as an EMG. In this test, the nerve is electrically stimulated while a second electrode detects the electrical impulse 'down-stream' from the first. This is usually done with surface patch electrodes (they are similar to those used for an ""'electrocardiogram'') that are placed on the skin over the nerve at various locations. One electrode stimulates the nerve with a very mild electrical impulse. The resulting electrical activity is recorded by the other electrodes. The distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes are used to calculate the speed of impulse transmission (nerve conduction velocity). A decreased speed of transmission indicates nerve disease.''The NCV test can be used to detect true nerve disorders (such as neuropathy) or conditions whereby muscles are affected by nerve injury (such as ''carpal tunnel syndrome''). Normal body temperature must be maintained for the NCV test, because low body temperatures slow nerve conduction.''Previous contributing authors and editors: Medical Author: Frederick Hecht, MD, FAAP, FACMG''Medical Editor: Barbara K. Hecht, Ph.D.' "
What are mitochondrial myopathies?,"'Mitochondrial myopathies are a group of neuromuscular diseases caused by damage to the mitochondria—small, energy-producing structures that serve as the cells\' ""power plants."" Nerve cells in the brain and muscles require a great deal of energy, and thus appear to be particularly damaged when mitochondrial dysfunction occurs. Some of the more common mitochondrial myopathies include Kearns-Sayre syndrome, myoclonus ''epilepsy'' with ragged-red fibers, and ''mitochondrial encephalomyopathy'' with lactic acidosis and ''stroke-like episodes''.' "
What are the symptoms of mitochondrial myopathies?,"'The symptoms of mitochondrial myopathies include muscle ''weakness'' or ''exercise'' intolerance, ''heart failure'' or rhythm disturbances, ''dementia'', movement disorders, ''stroke''-like episodes, deafness, ''blindness'', droopy eyelids, limited mobility of the eyes, ''vomiting'', and ''seizures''. The prognosis for these disorders ranges in severity from progressive weakness to death. Most mitochondrial myopathies occur before the age of 20, and often begin with ''exercise'' intolerance or muscle weakness. During physical activity, muscles may become easily fatigued or weak. Muscle cramping is rare, but may occur. ''Nausea'', ''headache'', and breathlessness are also associated with these disorders.'  "
Is there any treatment for mitochondrial disease?,"'Although there is no specific treatment for any of the mitochondrial myopathies, physical therapy may extend the range of movement of muscles and improve dexterity. Vitamin therapies such as riboflavin, coenzyme Q, and carnitine (a specialized amino acid) may provide subjective improvement in ''fatigue'' and energy levels in some patients.'  "
What is the prognosis for mitochondrial disease?,"'The prognosis for patients with mitochondrial myopathies varies greatly, depending largely on the type of disease and the degree of involvement of various organs. These disorders cause progressive weakness and can lead to death.'  "
What research is being done for mitochondrial disease?,"'The NINDS conducts and supports research on mitochondrial myopathies. The goals of this research are to increase scientific understanding of these disorders and to find ways to effectively treat, prevent, or potentially cure them.' "

Introduction to myopia,"'Myopia'' (or ''nearsightedness'') affects 20% to 30% of the population, but this eye disorder is easily corrected with ''eyeglasses'', ''contact lenses'' or surgery.''People who have myopia or nearsightedness have difficulty seeing distant objects, but can see objects that are near clearly. For example, a person who is nearsighted may not be able to make out highway signs until they are just a few ''feet'' away.' "
What Causes Myopia?,"'People who are nearsighted have what is called a refractive error. This means that the light rays bend incorrectly into the eye to transmit images to the brain. In people with myopia, the eyeball is too long or the ''cornea'' has too much curvature, so the light entering the eye is not focused correctly. Light rays of images focus in front of the retina, the light-sensitive part of the eye, rather than directly on the retina, causing ''blurred vision''.''Myopia runs in families and usually appears in childhood. Sometimes the condition plateaus, or sometimes it worsens with age.' "
What Are the Symptoms of Myopia?,"'People who are nearsighted often complain of ''headaches'', eyestrain, squinting or ''fatigue'' when driving, playing sports, or looking more than a few feet away.'  "
How Is Myopia Diagnosed?,'Myopia can be easily diagnosed using standard eye exams given by an eye doctor.' 
How Is Myopia Treated?,"'Glasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery can correct myopia.''With myopia, your prescription for glasses or contact ''lens'' is a negative number, such as -3.00. The higher the number, the stronger your lenses will be.''Refractive surgery can reduce or even eliminate your dependence on glasses or contact lenses. The most common procedures for myopia are performed with a laser, including:''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.' Photorefractive keratectomy. Also called PRK , a laser is used to remove a layer of corneal tissue, which flattens the cornea and allows light rays to focus closer to or even on the retina. Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis. Commonly called LASIK , a laser is used to cut a flap through the top of the cornea, a laser removes some corneal tissue, then the flap is dropped back into place. LASIK is the most common surgery used to correct nearsightedness. Corneal rings. Plastic corneal rings, called Intacs, are implanted into the eye to alter the shape of the cornea. One advantage of the rings is that they may be left in place permanently, may be removed in case of a problem, or adjusted should a prescription change be necessary."
What is MyPlate?,"'The US government (U.S. Department of Agriculture – USDA) developed a helpful guide for adults and children for optimal health. “''MyPlate''” replaces the familiar “food pyramid” that has been obsolete.\xa0The MyPlate model shows the five food groups (fruits, vegetables, proteins, grains, and dairy) in a proportion setting, making it easier to understand the types of food and quantity to include in each meal to have a healthy and balanced ''diet''.\xa0''Development of MyPlate'':''For over 100 years, the USDA has provided Americans with different types of food guides and pyramids to encourage healthy food choices. The Food Pyramid has been the popular and accepted mode since 1992. The idea behind the original Food Pyramid was that foods that should be eaten the most form the base of the pyramid, whereas those that should be eaten less would be toward the top. However, these guidelines were unclear and difficult to follow. The Food Pyramid was based on servings, without clear representation of the serving size or total number of calories to be consumed in a day.''Due to these drawbacks, a modification to the original Food Pyramid called MyPyramid was introduced in 2005. Food groups were coded by stripes in widths corresponding to the recommended servings from each group. All the stripes that tapered toward the top of the pyramid indicated that each food group includes both healthy and unhealthy foods. However, the new Food Pyramid was confusing and making it difficult for people to understand and follow. Hence, the USDA introduced MyPlate to provide a simple, easy-to-understand visual representation to eat healthy.' "
How does MyPlate work?,"'The plate is divided into four unequal sections to represent different food groups.\xa0''The main food groups are as follows:''Vegetables make up the largest portion on the plate, which is 40%, followed by grains, which is 30%. Fruits make up 10% of the plate, and proteins make up 20%. Fruits and vegetables fill half the plate, whereas proteins and grains fill the other half. Small amounts of dairy in a glass (milk) or cup (yogurt) is incorporated in the ''diet''.' Vegetables  Proteins  Grains  Fruits  Dairy "
What are the benefits of MyPlate? ,"'The benefits of MyPlate include:' MyPlate is a simple and easy model representing what an ideal meal should look like, without too many dietary restrictions. One of the positive facts about MyPlate is that it does not necessitate meat to be included. Instead, “protein” is part of the plate, which includes fish, shellfish, eggs or beans, peas, nuts, and seeds in addition to meat, making it easy for vegans or vegetarians and those with other dietary restrictions to follow. MyPlate recognizes the benefits of a plant-based diet; hence, it eliminates “oils” or “fats” section included in the previous Food Pyramid. MyPlate also incorporates dairy because it is believed to play an important role in maintaining good health."
How do I plan MyPlate?,"'MyPlate is based on the\xa02015-2020\xa0Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which provides detailed instructions for planning healthy meals and snacks. Some important points of these include:' Half the plate should be filled with fruits and vegetables. This includes whole or cut-up fruits without added sugars. Vegetables could be cooked (steamed/roasted/sautéed) or raw. It is advised to avoid fried vegetables as much as possible. Dairy options could be 1% or skimmed milk, cheese, or dairy options without full-fat. Half of the grains on the plate should be whole grains. Brown rice and whole-wheat pasta are examples of whole grains.  Proteins can be of different types, such as seafood, eggs, beans, unsalted nuts, or lean meat. High sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars should be avoided. Nutrition food and drinks can help as a guide to pick healthy food and drinks. For example, bread can have as much salt as salty snacks and packaged fruit juices have high sugar and very little fruit. It is advised to be physically active in addition to a healthy diet.  One should be focused on variety, amount, and nutrition."
What is the purpose of ear tube placement?,"'Middle ''ear infections'' (''otitis media'') are common in children. When a child has repeated ''ear infections'' or fluid build-up in the ears that do not go away easily or there are ''hearing'' problems or speech delays, a doctor may recommend surgery to insert an ear tube to allow the eardrum to equalize the pressure.''The surgery, called a myringotomy, is a tiny incision in the eardrum. Any fluid, usually thickened secretions will be removed. In most situations, a small ''plastic'' tube (a tympanostomy tube) is inserted into the eardrum to keep the middle ear aerated for a prolonged period.. These ventilating tubes remain in place for six months to several years. Eventually, they will move out of the eardrum (extrude) and fall into the ear canal. Your doctor may remove the tube during a routine office visit or it may simply fall out of the ear.''Less common conditions that may call for the placement of ear tubes are malformation of the eardrum or Eustachian tube, '""Down's syndrome""', ''cleft palate'', and barotrauma (middle ear injury caused by a reduction of air pressure), according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology.'  "
Ear tubes side effects: What are risks and complications of ear tubes?,"'While ear tube surgery is common, minor complications can occur in up to half of the children who have them inserted. Complications include:'  Failure to resolve the ear infections. Thickening of the eardrum over time, which affects hearing in a small percentage of patients. Persistent perforation after the tube falls out of the eardrum. Chronic ear drainage. Infection Hearing loss Scarring of the eardrum Ear canal skin tissue and material getting trapped inside the eardrum (cholesteatoma) Possible need to keep the ear dry and to use ear plugs Foreign body reaction to the tube itself - for example, an allergic reaction to the tube material (rare) While not a complication, some patients may have a need for further and more aggressive surgery such as tonsil, adenoid, sinus, or ear surgery."
What happens before the ear tubes procedure?,"'In most situations, the surgery is performed as an outpatient (no overnight stay usually required), at either the hospital or an outpatient surgery center. An anesthesiologist will monitor your child throughout the procedure. Usually, the anesthesiologist reviews the medical history before surgery. If your doctor has ordered preoperative laboratory studies, arrange to have these done several days in advance.'""If your child is old enough to understand what surgery is, be honest and up front as you explain the upcoming surgery. A calming and reassuring attitude will greatly ease your child's ""'anxiety''. Most children will feel better having had the pressure relieved in their ears.''Your child must not eat or drink anything 6 to 12 hours prior to their time of surgery; this includes even water or chewing gum. Anything in the stomach increases the chances of an anesthetic complication.''If your child is sick or has a ''fever'' the day before surgery, call the office. If your child wakes up sick the day of surgery, still proceed to the surgical facility as planned. Your doctor will decide if it is safe to proceed with surgery. However, if your child has ''chickenpox'', do not bring your child to the office or to the surgical facility.' "
What to do the day of ear tubes surgery,"'It is important that you know precisely what time you are to check-in with the surgical facility, and that you allow sufficient preparation time. Bring the required papers and forms with you, including the preoperative orders and history sheets. Your child should wear comfortable loose fitting clothes (pajamas are permissible). Leave all jewelry and valuables at home. They may bring a favorite toy, stuffed animal, or blanket.' "
What happens during ear tube placement?,"'Your child may be given a medication to help him or her relax prior to entering the operating room (premedication). In the operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of ''gas'' and an intravenous medication for sedation. During the procedure, which typically takes 10 to 15 minutes, your child will be continuously monitored including pulse oximeter (oxygen saturation of blood) and cardiac rhythm (''EKG''). The surgical team is prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room.''After the anesthetic takes effect, the doctor, using an operating microscope, makes a tiny incision in the eardrum through the ''outer ear'' canal. There will be no external incisions or ''stitches''. Fluid will be suctioned from the ear, and a tube inserted in the eardrum. Usually, drops will be placed in the ear, and a cotton plug inserted in the ear canal.' "
What happens after ear tubes surgery?,"'After surgery, your child will be taken to the recovery room to be monitored by a nurse. You may be invited into the recovery room as your child becomes aware of their surroundings and starts looking for you. Your child should be able to go home the same day as the surgery once they have fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes less than one hour.''Your child may resume a normal ''diet'' after he or she has fully recovered from the anesthetic. Even though they may be hungry immediately after surgery, it is best to feed them slowly to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Occasionally, children may vomit one or two times immediately after surgery. If ''vomiting'' persists, your doctor may prescribe medication to settle the stomach.' "
What are the general instructions and follow-up care for ear tubes?,"'An appointment for a follow-up ear check-up is usually arranged 14 to 28 days after the procedure. At this visit, the position and function of the tubes will be assessed.'""Usually, eardrops will be given to you the day of surgery. The surgeon will often place the same drops in the ear following the placement of the tubes. They are usually used after surgery for three days (3-4 drops each ear 3 times per day). If there is drainage from the ear after three days, you may be instructed to continue using the drops until the day before your office visit or as per doctor's instructions. Discontinue these drops if they cause severe ""'pain'' or a skin ''rash''.''You can ""pump"" them into the ear by pushing on the soft cartilage tissue located in front of the ear canal (medically termed the tragus).''Ear drainage may occur immediately after the procedure or at any time while the tubes are in place.''Yellow clear fluid or mucous may drain for several days to weeks after the surgery.''It is not unusual to see a bloody discharge following surgery. Cotton can be kept in the ear canal and changed as needed to keep dry.''If after the immediate post-operative period, profuse, foul-smelling discharge drains from the ear, an infection is the possible cause. If this occurs, begin by using eardrops for three days. If the drainage continues beyond three days, call the doctor to determine if additional medicine and/or an office visit is necessary.''Avoiding water for children with ear tubes or routine water precautions (wearing earplugs or headbands) is generally not recommended while tubes are in place with some exceptions. Water protection may be needed if ''pain'' results when the ears get wet, if there is prolonged drainage from the ear or for children who dive more than 6 ''feet'' under water, dunk their head in soapy bath tub water, or swim in areas other than chlorinated pools. There is an increased risk of infection in lake or pond water, as opposed to chlorinated water found in ''swimming'"" pools. Follow your doctor's advice regarding water precautions.""'Tympanostomy tubes usually stay in place from 6 to 18 months. If they stay in longer than two to three years, they may need to be surgically removed. It is important to have an ear check-up about every six months during this period. An audiogram is usually obtained at some point after the ear has healed. The tubes eventually fall out of the eardrum as the ear heals. Some children may have mild discomfort or bloody drainage at this time. The small hole in the eardrum at the old tube site usually heals within several weeks. Your doctor will instruct you when it is safe to allow water in the ears.''In some cases, insertion of ear tubes must be repeated if the tubes fall out and symptoms recur.'  "
What is the medical definition of myxedema (crisis) coma? Is it common?,"'Myxedema (crisis)\xa0''coma'' is a loss of brain function as a result of severe, longstanding low level of ''thyroid hormone'' in the blood (''hypothyroidism''). Myxedema com is considered a rare life-threatening complication of hypothyroidism, and represents one of the more serious side of of ''thyroid disease''.' "
What are the symptoms of hypothyroidism?,"'Before a person develops myxedema ''coma'', signs and ''symptoms of hypothyroidism'' usually are present and may have gone undiagnosed for a long time.''Symptoms of hypothyroidism include ''fatigue'', lethargy, mental impairment, ''depression'', ''cold'' intolerance, ''hoarseness'', ''dry skin'', ''weight gain'', change in menstrual cycles, ''constipation'', and ''headaches''.' "
What are the symptoms of myxedema coma?,"'People with myxedema coma may have symptoms and signs, for example:'   The body temperature is usually abnormally low (hypothermia), the core temperature may be as low as 80 F (26.6 C); Severe mental changes including hallucinations, disorientation, seizures, and ultimately, deep coma; Significant swelling (edema) all over the body with swollen eyes and thickening of the tongue, Sparse, dry hair, and loss of the outer thirds of the eyebrows; Difficulty breathing; Collections of fluid around the lungs and heart (pleural effusion and pericardial effusions); The heart may slow down and its ability to pump blood forward can be impaired; The gastrointestinal tract does not function well and sometimes it becomes paralyzed, thereby necessitating surgery; and Blood test abnormalities are a result of the increased fluid in the body. For example, sodium levels drop because of dilution, which is caused by the body retaining extra water."
What causes myxedema coma?,"'Most patients with myxedema coma have a history of hypothyroidism, thyroid surgery, or radioactive ''iodine'' treatment for thyroid disease. Very rarely, the problem is not caused by the inability of the thyroid gland to make thyroid hormone; but rather is caused by the failure of the ''pituitary gland'' or the hypothalamus to correctly signal the thyroid gland to perform its normal functions. In this situation, the thyroid gland is normal, but it is not receiving the signals from the pituitary gland or hypothalamus to make the thyroid hormone it is capable of producing.'  "
What triggers of myxedema coma?,"'Certain factors may suddenly trigger myxedema coma in a person with poorly controlled hypothyroidism. These include ''drugs'' (particularly ''sedatives'', narcotics, anesthesia, ''lithium'' (Eskalith, ''Lithobid''), and ''amiodarone'' (''Cordarone''), infections, ''stroke'', ''trauma'', ''heart failure'', digestive (gastrointestinal, GI) bleeding, hypothermia (abnormally low body temperature), and failing to take thyroid medications as prescribed by their doctor.' "
What procedures and tests diagnose myxedemia coma?,"'Initial laboratory evaluation usually includes a test for thyroid function (TSH, T3 and T4 levels). Other blood tests and heart and lung function tests may be needed.' "
What is the treatment for myxedema coma? Is it life threatening?,"'Treatment may include assisting the patient to breathe and warming them to raise the body temperature to normal. Often, antibiotics are started until it is certain that an infection is not present.''The method of replacing thyroid hormone in patients with myxedema coma is controversial. Many different approaches are used. In general, initial replacement is done by intravenous infusion, since the intestinal system may not be absorbing properly.''While common hypothyroidism without myxedema is usually treated with T4 replacement (the hormone produced in greatest quantity by the thyroid gland), in the case of myxedema coma, management is different. The thyroid gland also produces a small amount of another hormone, T3. This is the more metabolically active of the two hormones. In patients who are well, T4 is converted into T3 in the bloodstream. However, patients with myxedema coma are often so sick that this conversion is impaired. As a result, many doctors choose to treat these patients with T3 initially and start T4 therapy as well. Since T4 therapy can take a month or so to work, there is usually an overlap of these two hormones. Care is taken to avoid heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias) and ''stress'' on the heart, which can be caused by replacing thyroid hormone too quickly, particularly in elderly patients.''Mild ''thyroid disorders'' can be managed by primary or internal medicine doctors, however; it usually id managed by a thyroid specialist (endocrinologist) because treatment can be complicated and critical.' "
How can myxedema coma be prevented?,"'The ideal way to manage this condition is to prevent it from occurring in the first place. An individual with hypothyroidism should visit their doctor regularly for follow-up and blood testing to be certain that their replacement dose is appropriate.''If an individual has symptoms that concerns them, but has not beendiagnosed with hypothyroidism, they should visit their health care practitioner to discuss their concerns and explore the option of testing for thyroid imbalance.'
