Questions,Answer
What is Q fever?,"'Q fever is an uncommon infectious disease. Animals transmit the disease to humans (this sort of infectious disease is called a zoonosis). Most often, cattle, goats, and sheep transmit Q fever, but it can also come from cats, ''dogs'"", rabbits, and other animals. Rarely, it's possible for Q fever to spread from person to person. In 2010, there were 131 cases of Q fever in the United States reported to the Centers for Disease Control and ""'Prevention''; however, some people with Q fever have only very mild symptoms and so do not seek medical care. Therefore, the actual number of cases is probably larger. In most people, Q fever may cause high fevers, ''sweating'', muscle ''aches'', ''headaches'', ''cough'', ''chills'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''abdominal pain'', ''chest pain'', and ''diarrhea''. The disease can cause a chronic infection that can result in endocarditis (infection and inflammation of the valves of the heart). In March, 2013, the CDC published the first set of national guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Q fever.'  "
Where does the name Q fever come from? What causes Q fever?,"'When Q fever was first identified as a disease in the 1930s, the cause was unknown. The ""Q"" in Q fever stands for the word ''query''. In 1937, Australian and American researchers discovered the bacterium that causes Q fever, ''Coxiella burnetii''.' "
How does Q fever spread?,"'The bacterium that causes Q fever is found in the waste products (urine or feces) of infected animals. It can also be found in the milk of infected animals. Another main source of transmission is from contact with the placenta and other reproductive products from infected animals. The bacteria can be inhaled or ingested. Rarely, it can be spread through human-to-human contact or through tick bites. The bacteria can live for weeks in the environment. Exposure to just one ''Coxiella burnetii'' bacterium can cause Q fever.' "
What is the incubation period for Q fever?,'The incubation period for Q fever is two to 48 days with an average of two to three weeks.' 
Who is at risk for getting Q fever?,"'People most at risk for Q fever are those who work with the animals that can carry the disease or who live in parts of the world where it is common. Men are more often affected than are women, and adults more often than children. People with weakened immune systems are also at higher risk. Recently, some cases of Q fever have been reported in U.S. military personnel who have spent time in Afghanistan and Iraq. Because the organism that causes Q fever can live a long time in the environment, it can spread via dust particles blown to sites surrounding farms so even people without direct contact with animals can develop the disease.' "
Are there different forms of Q fever?,"'Q fever can present in an acute form and a chronic form. The acute form lasts for a few weeks, while the chronic form lasts for months to years.' "
Does pasteurization prevent the transmission of Q fever?,"'Q fever can be spread in unpasteurized milk; however, the process of pasteurization kills the bacteria that causes Q fever.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Q fever?,"'About half of all people who are infected with the bacterium that causes Q fever have no symptoms at all. When the acute form of Q fever does cause symptoms, the symptoms can vary from person to person. Most often, people will suddenly develop ''flu''-like symptoms, including fever (as high as 104 F-105 F), chills, malaise, ''fatigue'', muscle and joint aches, severe ''headache'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', ''cough'', ''rash'', and chest or ''abdominal pain''. These symptoms may last up to a few weeks. The chronic form of Q fever, which occurs in only about 5% of those people infected, most often causes an infection and inflammation of the valves inside the heart called endocarditis. The ''symptoms of endocarditis'' can include fever, ''night sweats'', ''shortness of breath'', muscle and joint aches, ''edema'' (swelling of the legs), and ''rash''.'  "
What types of specialist treat Q fever?,"'Q fever can be treated by any physician; however, it is commonly treated by an infectious-disease specialist. Chronic or severe infections may involve other specialists like cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, pulmonologists, and internists due to organ complications that may develop. Pediatricians and ob-gyn doctors may also be consulted.' "
How do physicians diagnose Q fever?,"'The diagnosis of Q fever is difficult because the symptoms are very similar to many other illnesses and vary a lot from person to person. The diagnosis should be suspected in people who have risk factors or who live in an area where Q fever is common and present with the acute onset of symptoms. In order to confirm the diagnosis, a blood sample can be sent to test for antibodies to the bacterium. Because antibody levels can remain high for years after a person has been infected, elevated antibody levels do not necessarily mean that the patient is acutely infected. Samples should be sent again a few weeks later to look for changing antibody levels that confirm the diagnosis of acute infection. Samples can also be sent for ''PCR'' (''polymerase chain reaction'') testing, which can detect infection earlier than the antibody tests, but this is less often available. People who have tested positive for acute infection should have follow-up testing done for up to two years to watch for the development of chronic Q fever infection. In chronic Q fever infection, diagnosis can also be made by testing tissue from infected heart valves if they are surgically removed and replaced. Culturing ''Coxiella burnetii'' from serum or tissue is possible but requires special lab facilities because of the highly infectious nature of the organism. Once a diagnosis of Q fever is made, it must be reported to the state health department.' "
Is Q fever contagious?,"'Q fever is one of the most ''contagious'' diseases known and is easily spread from infected animals to humans. As few as one or two bacteria can cause infection. However, human-to-human transmission is rare. Isolation of an infected human is unnecessary.' "
What is the contagious period for Q fever?,"'The bacterium that causes Q fever, ''Coxiella burnetii'', can be spread easily from the urine and feces of infected animals, as well as from the placenta of infected animals. The bacterium can survive for weeks in the environment and is contagious the entire time.' "
What is the danger of getting Q fever while pregnant?,"'Q fever is very dangerous in ''pregnancy''. About 80% of pregnant women with Q fever will develop a complication if untreated. The complications range from miscarriage to premature delivery and result in fetal death almost half the time. Pregnant women are also at higher risk for developing chronic Q fever. Women who are infected in their ''first trimester'' of pregnancy are more likely to develop complications. With appropriate treatment, the risk of these complications can be minimized.' "
Is Q fever deadly?,"'The acute form of Q fever is rarely fatal (1%-2%), and most people get better without any treatment. About 5% of people with acute Q fever will go on to develop chronic Q fever. The chronic form of Q fever is more dangerous. Without treatment, up to 40% of people with chronic Q fever will die, and 100% of people with endocarditis caused by chronic Q fever will die. With appropriate treatment, chronic Q fever causes death in 10% of people.' "
What complications may arise with Q fever?,"'The main complication seen with acute Q fever is ''pneumonia'', which will affect 30%-50% of patients. Another complication can be ''hepatitis'' (inflammation of the ''liver''). Rarely, patients can develop ''myocarditis'' (''heart inflammation''), ''osteomyelitis'' (bone inflammation), acalculous ''cholecystitis'' (inflammation of the gallbladder), and ''encephalitis'' (inflammation of the brain). Pregnant women have complications ranging from miscarriage to premature delivery. About 20% of people will have persistent ''fatigue'' called post-Q fever ''fatigue'' syndrome, which lasts more than a year after the infection. Also, 5% of patients with acute Q fever will go on to develop chronic Q fever. The main complication of chronic Q fever is endocarditis, which will affect 60%-70% of patients. People who already have problems with their heart valves or their immune system are more likely to develop endocarditis. The second most common complication is vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels), which is more likely in people who have grafts in their blood vessels. Chronic lung infections and ''chronic fatigue syndrome'' can also occur. Endocarditis can cause destruction of the heart valves and result in ''heart failure''. Surgery may be required to repair or replace the valves. Vasculitis, especially in people with grafts or aneurysms in their blood vessels, can also require surgery.'  "
"If it is not Q fever, what else could it be?","'Because the initial symptoms of Q fever are shared by many other illnesses, there are a lot of other possible explanations for the symptoms. ''Influenza'', ''pneumonia'', ''Lyme disease'', ''Rocky Mountain spotted fever'', and viral or bacterial ''meningitis'' are some other diseases that can have similar symptoms.' "
What should people do if they have been exposed to Q fever?,"'If someone has been exposed to Q fever but does not have any symptoms, prophylactic treatment (treatment to prevent someone from getting the disease) is not recommended. If someone develops any of the symptoms of Q fever, he or she should be evaluated promptly by a medical professional.' "
Is there any treatment for Q fever?,"'Acute Q fever is treated with antibiotic medications (usually ''doxycycline'') for 14 days. Pregnant women with acute Q fever should take the antibiotic ''trimethoprim''/''sulfamethoxazole'' (''Bactrim'', ''Septra'') from the time of diagnosis until week 32 of the pregnancy. Chronic Q fever treatment is more complicated and generally requires months to years of antibiotics.'  "
What is the prognosis for Q fever?,"'The prognosis for patients with acute Q fever is very good, with most patients recovering fully within a few weeks to months. The prognosis for patients with chronic Q fever is poorer, with up to 10% of patients dying even with appropriate treatment.' "
Is there a vaccine against Q fever?,"'There is no vaccine approved in the U.S. for the prevention of Q fever, although there is a vaccine used in Australia to protect humans in certain occupations like those in the sheep industry.' "
Is Q fever a bioterrorism threat?,"'Because the organism that causes Q fever is so highly infectious, ''Coxiella burnetii'' has been researched as a ''bioterrorism'' weapon. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) rate ''Coxiella burnetii'' as a class B priority agent, in a classification scheme where class A agents have the most potential for harm and class C agents the least.' "
Where can people find more information about Q fever?,'Excellent information about Q fever can be found at the web site of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: ''http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/''.' 
What is arthritis quackery?,'Quackery (the business of promoting unproven remedies) is recognized as a billion dollar industry. We feel the buyer should beware!' 
What are unproven arthritis remedies?,"'The following remedies and tests have no scientific proof of benefits related to arthritis:'""[Now you've heard it from ""'A''lfalfa to ''Z''inc. Beware when you take care!]' "
What should you know about quad marker screening?,"'The quad marker screening test (quad screen) is a blood test administered in ''pregnancy'', typically between the 15th and 20th weeks of gestation. Similar to the triple screen, the quad marker screen provides information about whether there is an increased risk for certain ''birth defects'' in the baby.''The test is simple and involves taking a blood sample as for any other routine blood test. The quad marker test is a screening test, meaning that it gives information about risk, but it does not allow the definitive diagnosis of any conditions. It can only signal that further testing should be done to confirm a diagnosis. There is no risk to the baby from the test.'  "
Why did my doctor order a quad marker screening test?,"'The quad screen looks at the three substances also measured in the triple screen (alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and estriol) test plus one additional substance, inhibin A.'""Looking at levels of these four substances in the mother's bloodstream allows an estimation of risk for ""'neural tube defects'' and certain chromosomal abnormalities, like ''Down syndrome''.' Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is produced by the liver of the fetus Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone made by the placenta Estriol is an estrogen made both by the placenta and the liver of the fetus Inhibin-A is another hormone made by the placenta"
How accurate is the quad marker screening test?,"""The test is a screening test only, and is not 100% accurate. It can predict about 85% of open neural tube defects, problems with the development of the baby's brain and spinal cord. It predicts about 80% of fetuses with ""'Down syndrome'' in women over age 35 and about 75% \xa0in younger women. The fact that it is not 100% accurate means that not all women who have a positive high risk result on the quad screen will have a fetus with a birth defect, and the test may also be normal even in the presence of birth defects.''For example, about 50 women out of every 1,000 will have a result on the quad screen that indicates an increased risk of a birth defect, but only one to two of those women will actually have a baby with an open neural tube defect. About 40 women out of 1,000 will have a result indicating an increased risk of Down syndrome, but only one to two of these women will have a baby with Down syndrome.' "
What should you do if you have normal or abnormal tests results?,"""As with any screening test, an abnormal result does not mean that the fetus definitely has a birth defect or genetic condition. It only means that the blood levels of these four substances suggest that a woman's risk is increased of having a baby with certain conditions. Women who have a result suggesting increased risk are typically offered further testing. This can include repeating the quad screen and/or having a high definition ""'ultrasound'' examination to look for signs of birth defects or abnormalities in the developing baby. If this testing is abnormal, the mother may be offered the choice to undergo ''amniocentesis''. Amniocentesis involves withdrawing a sample of ''amniotic fluid'' for genetic and chromosome testing, and it can definitively establish the diagnosis of genetic and chromosomal problems in most fetuses. Amniocentesis carries a small risk of ''miscarriage'' (fewer than 1% of fetuses tested).' "
What are the quadriceps?,"'The quadriceps are located in the front of the thigh and are responsible for extending (straightening) the knee, as well as flexing the hip. It is made up of four muscles:''The rectus femoris begins with its attachment to the ilium, one of the pelvic bones and then crosses the hip. As it runs down the front of the thigh, the muscle portion of the rectus transitions to become a tendon and joins the tendons of the three vastus muscles to form the quadriceps tendon, just above the kneecap (''patella''). The tendon is renamed the patellar tendon as it crosses the ''knee joint'' and attaches to the tibial tubercle, the bony prominence on the tibia (shinbone).''The quadriceps muscles are contained within a fascia compartment, a sheet of fibrous connective tissue, along with the femoral artery and the femoral nerve.' Vastus medialis Vastus intermedius Vastus lateralis Rectus femoris"
What are the different types of quadriceps injuries?,"'The most common injury of the quadriceps is a ''contusion'' or ''bruise'', caused by a direct blow to the anterior thigh, which can cause some blood vessels within the muscle to be damaged and bleed. This causes ''pain'' due to inflammation of the surrounding muscle. Since the rectus femoris muscle lies closest to the surface of the anterior thigh, it is the muscle most often contused.''If there is significant bleeding into the muscle, ''compartment syndrome'' ''may occur, where the pressure within the compartment that contains the quadriceps rises higher than ''blood pressure'', thereby preventing muscle tissue from being supplied with oxygen-rich blood pumped from the ''heart''.''The quadriceps may also be ''strained'' due to overuse or overstretching. The strain may involve muscle fibers, tendon fibers, or both.''Muscle ''strains'' can be categorized depending on the severity of injury. There are three different grades of muscle ''strains''. Grade 1 strains involve muscle fibers that are stretched but not torn. Grade 2 strains involve a muscle that is partially torn with more extensive damage. Grade 3 strains occur when a muscle is completely torn.''Tendinitis'' describes inflammation of the tendon (itis=inflammation).'""Jumper's knee""' or ''peri-patellar tendinosis'' describes chronic degeneration of the tendon where the muscle fibers transition into tendon fibers just above the ''patella'' (kneecap).''Quadriceps tendinitis'' describes inflammation of the tendon above the patella.''Patellar tendinitis'' describes inflammation below the patella at the level of the ''knee joint''.''Osgood-Schlatter disease'', also known as apophysitis of the tibial tubercle, occurs when there is inflammation of the bone where the patellar tendon attaches the quadriceps muscles to the tibia. While it is most commonly seen in adolescents, it may also occur in adults.''The quadriceps or the patellar tendon may completely ''rupture'', which leads to the inability to fully extend or straighten the knee.''Rarely, the fascia that surrounds and contains the quadriceps may tear and the muscles may ''herniate'' through the defect.' "
What are causes and risk factors for a quadriceps injury?,"'Contusions'' are usually caused by a direct blow to the quadriceps muscle, usually by another person or by an object. This can cause damage to the muscle fibers and associated bleeding. If there is significant ''trauma'', like a major crush injury or if there is an associated ''fractured'' femur, enough bleeding can occur so that the pressure increases inside of the compartment that contains the quadriceps muscles.''Compartment syndrome'' is a surgical emergency that occurs when pressure inside the muscle compartment is so high that it prevents adequate blood flow to the muscle itself. This can cause the muscle cells to die due to the lack of oxygen supply, and it may also lead to long-term muscle and nerve damage.''Strains'' of the quadriceps occur as a consequence of repetitive overuse, causing muscle fibers to become inflamed and sometimes partially tear. Usually, there is greater load bearing than the muscle can tolerate; think of the leg repetitively straightening while lifting weights, causing the muscle to ''fatigue'' and potentially become damaged. This is commonly seen in athletes who are ''weight training'', but it can also occur in people who perform manual ''labor'' that requires some degree of lifting heavier objects. Partial tears can also occur when ''running'' or kicking.''Tendinitis'' is inflammation of the tendon that attaches the quadriceps muscles to the tibial tubercle. Most commonly, the patellar tendon becomes inflamed, leading to ''pain'' and swelling in the area below the kneecap. This is a repetitive injury problem as well, where damage occurs to the tendon causing acute inflammation.''Peri-patellar tendinosis'' or '""jumper's knee""' is an overuse injury where microtears occur in the area where the quadriceps tendon inserts into the top or bottom of the patella. Instead of causing acute inflammation, the area starts degenerating and scarring. This injury most commonly occurs in people who repeatedly engage in sports that involve intense jumping like volleyball, basketball, or track and field.''Tendon rupture'' occurs when there is a violent contraction of the quadriceps muscle when the knee is flexed (bent), causing the quadriceps or patellar tendon to completely tear or rupture. Quadriceps tendon rupture occurs more commonly in patients who are older than 40 years of age. Patellar tendon rupture occurs less frequently and is typically seen in younger patients.''The tendon may be at increased risk of rupture due to an underlying medical condition or from the use of certain medications, including the following:''Muscle ''hernia'' occurs when the muscle fascia tears and part of the quadriceps muscle protrudes (herniates) through the opening. This usually occurs when the muscle fascia has been previously injured and is somewhat weakened, though the cause may be uncertain. A forceful kick may cause the muscle to herniate.' Kidney disease Metabolic bone disease (such as hyperparathyroidism) Rheumatoid arthritis Diabetes mellitus Gout Obesity Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Anabolic steroid use Fluoroquinolone antibiotic use (ciprofloxacin [Cipro, Cetraxal, ProQuin], levofloxacin [Levaquin, Quixin, Iquix], and moxifloxacin [Vigamox, Avelox, Moxeza])"
What are symptoms and signs of a quadriceps injury?,"'As with most orthopedic injuries, the initial symptom of a quadriceps strain, partial muscle tear, or tendinitis/tendinosis is ''pain'' and tenderness. There may also be ''swelling'' and decreased range of motion that may result in a ''limp''. This ''pain'' may be acute in onset, or it may arise gradually and become progressively more painful with activity.''If there is a complete rupture of the quadriceps or patellar tendon, in addition to ''pain'', the patient will be unable to fully extend the knee because the connection of the quadriceps muscle to the bone has been lost.''Compartment syndrome presents with intense pain, often out of proportion to the physical examination. There may be decreased range of motion of the leg and changes in sensation in the leg and foot.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose a quadriceps injury?,"'A health care provider often makes the diagnosis of most quadriceps injuries by taking a detailed history of the injury and performing a physical examination. Contusion, muscles strain, tendon inflammation, tendon rupture, and muscle herniation are often diagnosed at the bedside.''Plain ''X-rays'' may be helpful if there is concern that there is an associated fracture (''broken bone'') of the femur or patella. ''Myositis'' ossificans (a bony growth which develops within the muscle) may also be seen on plain films.''In certain instances, ''MRI'' may be performed to confirm the diagnosis made at the bedside.''Ultrasound'' may be useful to determine a partial versus a complete tendon rupture.''Creatine phosphokinase (CPK or CK) levels may be measured if there is concern that major muscle damage has occurred. CPK leaks from damaged muscle cells and levels can be markedly elevated in ''rhabdomyolysis''.''Creatinine'' is a blood test that measures kidney function. Patients with significant muscle damage and ''rhabdomyolysis'' can develop ''kidney failure''.''If compartment syndrome is suspected, the compartment pressure can be measured by inserting a probe into the muscle compartment and directly measuring the pressure within it.' "
What is the treatment for a quadriceps injury?,"'Most quadriceps injuries can be treated with RICE (rest, ice, compression, and elevation). However, compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency, and many cases of tendon rupture will also require surgical management.' Crutches or other gait-assist devices might be needed depending upon the level of pain and whether or not the individual can weight-bear on the injured leg. After a short period of rest, most people can start returning to normal function as pain allows. However, for athletes or for those who lift or repetitively bend/squat at work or home, physical therapy might be needed to regain range of motion and strength in the injured leg. Anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen (Motrin and Advil) may be helpful. Even though these medications are available over the counter, it is important to make certain that they are safe to take for the individual patient. They may not be appropriate for patients with peptic ulcer disease, those with bleeding disorders, those with kidney disease, and those patients who are taking anticoagulation medications (blood thinners). Health care providers and pharmacists are able to give advice regarding the safety of over-the-counter medications."
Are there home remedies for a quadriceps injury?,"'Most quadriceps injuries can initially be treated at home with rest, ice, compression, and elevation.' Ibuprofen may be used as an anti-inflammatory and for pain control. If the pain is worsening or if a limp persists for more than a few hours, seek medical care for an evaluation. Emergency medical care should be pursued if the patient cannot extend or straighten the knee (concern for tendon rupture), or if there is intense pain, swelling, and numbness of the leg (concern for compartment syndrome). It is also appropriate to seek emergency care if there was a significant traumatic event like a car wreck, major fall, or another injury. This is especially true in patients who are taking anticoagulation medications and are at increased risk of bleeding."
What is the recovery time for a quadriceps injury?,"'The recovery time for a quadriceps injury depends upon the injury and may range from a few days for a contusion to many months for a ruptured tendon.''The goal of treatment for all quadriceps injuries is to have the patient return to the same level of activity as before the injury. In most cases, this is possible, depending upon the underlying medical condition of the patient and the severity of the injury.'  "
What are complications of a quadriceps injury?,"'When a large muscle like the quadriceps is injured, the body can lay down excess calcium as part of the healing process. This condition, called ''myositis'' ossificans, can cause pain and decreased range of motion in the affected leg. The initial treatment includes rest, ice, and anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen (''Motrin'' and ''Advil''). Physical therapy may be considered to increase range of motion. After many months, if this fails, surgery may be needed to remove the excess bone.''Compartment syndrome may occur as a complication of ''trauma'' to the anterior compartment of the thigh, where the quadriceps muscle group is located. Crush injuries or a fractured femur is often the cause. Compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency, and the compartment needs to be opened to relieve the pressure and to prevent permanent muscle and nerve damage.' "
Is it possible to prevent a quadriceps injury?,"'Sometimes quadriceps injuries occur and cannot be entirely prevented. An accidental direct blow to the quadriceps resulting in a contusion, for example, can occur during a sporting activity.''Overuse injuries may be preventable, especially if the patient ignores warning signs of mild discomfort and continues with repetitive activities that cause further damage.'""It's often possible to prevent muscle strains by making certain that the quadriceps muscle has been adequately stretched before vigorous activity. Individuals should always stretch and warm up before exercising, People who do physical ""'labor'' at work and around the house should also take a few minutes to warm up before engaging in these activities. Similarly, after exertion, a muscle may also need to be cooled down, stretched, and rested to prevent muscle strains, tendinitis, and even tendon rupture.' "
What relieves heartburn fast?,"'If you are experiencing ''heartburn'', you may ease the problem by:''Other medications for heartburn, including the H2 receptor blockers and ''proton pump inhibitors'' or PPI, may provide long term relief from heartburn.' Standing up straight: Lying down may put more pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter or LES. Standing up reduces this pressure and decreases the escape of acidic contents from the stomach upwards through the food pipe. This is the reason it is advised to not lie down or sleep right after eating.  Drinking non-fat milk: Non-fat milk can act as a temporary barrier between the gut lining and the acidic stomach contents. This may provide relief in symptoms. Full fat milk should not be consumed for heartburn as it can aggravate acid reflux. Low-fat yogurt also provides a soothing effect in heartburn along with providing probiotics or good bacteria that aid digestion. Loosening up your clothing: Tight clothes can put pressure on the tummy causing acid reflux or heartburn Taking ginger: Ginger has several medicinal properties. It is anti-inflammatory and also helps in the digestion of food. Sipping some ginger tea may prevent and relieve heartburn Taking over the counter antacids: Antacids provide relief by neutralizing the acidic contents. They provide rapid relief from heartburn.  Drinking dilute lemon water: A small amount of lemon juice mixed with water and honey can help ease the symptoms of heartburn."
What is heartburn?,'Heartburn refers to the burning sensation in the chest due to backflow or reflux of the acidic stomach contents into the food pipe (''esophagus''). Almost everyone experiences occasional heartburn. When heartburn occurs frequently and interferes with the daily routine it is called ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' or ''GERD''. The food pipe or esophagus is a tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. The lower end of the esophagus has a muscular valve called the lower esophageal sphincter or LES. The LES guards the reflux of stomach contents into the food pipe. In ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'') the LES does not close properly allowing the stomach contents to leak back or reflux into the food pipe and irritate it.' 
What foods cause heartburn?,"'The foods triggering heartburn may be different for different people. Some of the common culprit foods and ''drinks'' for heartburn are:' Spicy foods Citrus fruits such as lemons, oranges and grapefruit Tomatoes including tomato ketchups Vinegar Chocolate Large or fatty meals Alcohol Coffee and caffeinated drinks such as tea and soda Peppermint Onions Carbonated drinks Aerated drinks Fatty meats like ham or bacon"
Are bananas good for heartburn?,"'Bananas are low-acid fruits that can help ease heartburn. They coat the irritated inner lining of the food pipe (esophagus) thereby lowering the discomfort. They are also rich in ''fiber'' content and help to digest food better. Bananas are rich in pectin, a type of soluble fiber. Pectin helps move the stomach contents through the gut. This further prevents ''indigestion'' and heartburn as food that sticks around will continue to stimulate acid production.''Other foods that can ease heartburn are melons, oatmeal, green vegetables and yogurt.' "
Facts you should know about smoking and quitting smoking," Although smoking is an addiction, people can quit smoking. Secondhand smoke is harmful to the health of children, unborn children, family members, and coworkers. Quitting smoking cuts the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory diseases. The steps in quitting, each of which requires special attention and efforts by the smoker, are getting ready to quit, quitting, and staying quit. A number of techniques are available to assist people who want to quit, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), behavioral modification, self-help literature, and prescription medications. In nicotine replacement therapy, which is the cornerstone of most smoking cessation programs, another source of nicotine is substituted while the cigarettes are stopped. (The idea of nicotine replacement therapy is to eliminate both the smoking habit - although the addiction remains - and the symptoms of withdrawal. Then, the replacement nicotine is gradually stopped.) Currently, three forms of nicotine replacement therapy are available over the counter: nicotine patches, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenges, while two forms are available by prescription, an inhaler and a nasal spray. Nicotine replacement therapy has about a 25% success rate, which increases to 35% or 40% when nicotine replacement therapy is combined with intensive behavioral counseling. Nicotine-containing substances have side effects, interactions with other medications, effects on other medical conditions, and limitations in their use. Varenicline (Chantix) is a prescription drug that can help adults quit smoking. It is believed to act on the same receptors (the sites where nicotine acts to produce its effects) in the brain as nicotine, resulting in activation (stimulation) of these receptors and blocking the ability of nicotine to attach to these receptors. A prescription drug called bupropion (Zyban, Wellbutrin) has also been found to be effective in helping people to stop smoking. e-cigarettes are smokable, refillable or replaceable cartridges or cartridges that hold liquid that contains nicotine, solvents, and flavors. The safety of e-cigarettes is not known at this time."
What problems does smoking cause?,"'By smoking, you can cause health problems not only for yourself but also for those around you.'""Smoking is an addiction. Tobacco contains nicotine, a drug that is addictive. The nicotine, therefore, makes it very difficult (although not impossible) to quit. In fact, since the U.S. Surgeon General's 1964 report on the dangers of smoking, millions of Americans have quit. Still, approximately 484,000 deaths occur in the U.S. each year from smoking-related illnesses. This represents almost 1 out of every 5 deaths. The reason for these deaths is that smoking greatly increases the risk of getting ""'lung cancer'', ''heart attack'', chronic lung disease, ''stroke'', and many other ''cancers''. Smokers die an average of 10 years earlier than nonsmokers. Smoking is the most preventable cause of death. In addition, smoking is perhaps the most preventable cause of ''breathing'' (respiratory) diseases within the USA.'""Smoking harms not just the smoker, but also family members, coworkers, and others who breathe the smoker's cigarette smoke, called ""'secondhand smoke'' or passive smoke. Among infants up to 18 months of age, secondhand smoke is associated with as many as 300,000 cases of ''chronic bronchitis'' and ''pneumonia'"" each year. In addition, secondhand smoke from a parent's cigarette increases a child's chances for middle ear problems, causes ""'coughing'' and ''wheezing'', worsens ''asthma'"", and increases an infant's risk of dying from ""'sudden infant death syndrome'' (''SIDS'').''Smoking is also harmful to the unborn fetus. If a ''pregnant'' woman smokes, her fetus is at an increased risk of ''miscarriage'', early delivery (prematurity), ''stillbirth'', infant death, and low birth weight. In fact, it has been estimated that if all women quit ''smoking during pregnancy'', about 4,000 new ''babies'' would not die each year.''Exposure to passive smoke can also cause ''cancer''. Research has shown that non-smokers who reside with a smoker have a 24% increase in risk for developing lung ''cancer'' when compared with other non-smokers. An estimated 3,000 lung ''cancer'' deaths occur each year in the U.S. that are attributable to ''passive smoking'', and an estimated 49,000 deaths each year in total from all smoking-related conditions occur as a result of secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke also increases the risk of ''stroke'' and ''heart disease''. If both parents smoke, a teenager is more than twice as likely to smoke as a teenager whose parents are both nonsmokers. Even in households where only one parent smokes, young people are more likely to start smoking.'""The term addictive disease or addiction describes a persistent habit that is harmful to the person. Thus, addiction is a chronic (long duration) disease with reliance on the substance causing the addiction. The addictive substance also causes the accompanying deterioration of a person's physical and psychological health.""""Psychologically, an individual's behavior pattern establishes how the addictive substance is used. One type of behavior is compulsive behavior, which is an overwhelming and irresistible interest in use of the substance. For example, the compulsive addict makes sure that the substance is always available. Another type of behavior is habitual behavior, which is using the substance regularly or occasionally for the desirable effects. Physically, continuous use of the substance leads to dependence on the drug by the body. This dependence means that when the drug is discontinued, symptoms of withdrawal or distress occur.""'Nicotine is the component of cigarettes that addicts. Almost immediately upon ''inhalation'', the body responds to the nicotine. An individual feels relaxed, calmer, and happier than before the inhalation. These pleasant feelings reflect the physical side of addiction, but then, not smoking cigarettes causes a craving for more cigarettes, irritability, impatience, ''anxiety'', and other unpleasant symptoms. Indeed, these symptoms are the symptoms of withdrawal from cigarettes. Moreover, with time, more and more nicotine is desired to produce the favorable effects and to avoid the symptoms of withdrawal.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of cigarette addiction?,"'The signs of addiction to cigarettes include:''Quitting smoking makes a difference right away in the way you feel. You can taste and smell food better. Your breath smells better. Your ''cough'' goes away. These benefits happen for men and women of all ages, even those who are older. They happen for healthy people as well as those who already have a disease or condition caused by smoking.''Even more importantly, in the long run, quitting smoking cuts the risk of lung cancer, many other cancers (including laryngeal, oral ''cavity'', stomach, esophageal, cervical, kidney, bladder, and colon cancers), ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and other lung or breathing (respiratory) diseases (for example, chronic ''bronchitis'', ''pneumonia'', and ''emphysema''). Smoking also increases the risk of ''peripheral vascular disease'' and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Moreover, ex-smokers have better health than current smokers. For example, ex-smokers have fewer days of illness, fewer health complaints, and less frequent bouts with chronic ''bronchitis'' and ''pneumonia'' than current smokers. People who quit smoking can actually reduce their risk of developing lung cancer or other smoking-related diseases.''Finally, quitting smoking saves money. The average cost of a pack of cigarettes is approximately $6.28 a pack (depending on where you live). A smoker with a pack a day habit spends approximately $44.00 per week ($2,288 per year).'

What are the steps in quitting?,"'First, one can do certain things to get ready to quit. Then, there are other things to do on the day of quitting. Finally, one can do things to help oneself to remain abstinent. (This is the hardest part.) ' "
Getting ready to quit smoking," Set a date for quitting. If possible, plan to have a 
  friend quit smoking with you. 
 It's best to pick a day within the next month. A date too far off in the future 
 will give you a chance to procrastinate and postpone, while a date too soon may 
 not allow you to make a plan for medications or support systems. Notice when and why you smoke. Try to find the things 
  in your daily life that you often do while smoking (such as drinking your 
  morning cup of coffee or driving a car). 
  Change your smoking routines: Keep your cigarettes in 
  a different place. Smoke with your other hand. Don't do anything else when you 
  are smoking. Think about how you feel when you smoke. 
  Smoke only in certain places, such as outdoors. 
 When you want a cigarette, wait a few minutes. Try to 
  think of something to do instead of smoking. For example, you might chew gum 
  or drink a glass of water. 
  Buy one pack of cigarettes at a time. Switch to a 
brand of cigarettes that you don't like. "
On the day you quit smoking,"   Get rid of all your cigarettes. Put away your 
  ashtrays.  Change your morning routine. When you eat breakfast, 
  don't sit in the same place at the kitchen table. Stay busy. 
  When you get the urge to smoke, do something else 
  instead. 
  Carry other things to put in your mouth, such as gum, 
  hard candy, or a toothpick. 
  Reward yourself at the end of the day for not 
smoking. See a movie or go out and enjoy your favorite meal.  Tell your friends and family members about your decision to quit 
	smoking, and ask for their support."
Staying quit,"   The expected consequences of quitting are 
  irritability, difficulty concentrating, increased appetite, and of course, 
  urges to smoke. So, if you feel more short-tempered or distracted or sleepier 
  than usual, don't worry because these feelings will pass. 
  Try to exercise. For example,
	go for a walk,
	ride a 
  bike, if you have access to a pool
 swim, take a
	yoga or
	Pilates class. 
  Consider the positive things about quitting. For 
  example, think about how much you like yourself as a non-smoker, the health 
  benefits for you and your family, and the example you set for others around 
  you. A positive attitude will help you through the tough times. 
  When you feel tense, try to keep busy and think about 
  ways to ease the tenseness. Tell yourself that smoking won't make it any 
  better, and go do something else. 
  Eat regular meals because feeling hungry is sometimes 
  mistaken for the desire to smoke. 
  Start putting the money you save by not 
  buying cigarettes in a ""money jar."" 
  Let others know that you have quit smoking. You will 
  find that most people will support you. Many of your smoking friends may want 
  to know how you quit. It's good to talk to others about your quitting. In 
  fact, people who stay off smoking for at least one year often have had very 
  strong support from a companion or co-worker. 
  If you slip-up and smoke, don't be discouraged or give up and return to 
 your smoking habit. Many 
  former smokers have tried to quit several times before they finally 
succeed. "
What methods can help a person quit smoking?,"'Several methods are available to assist those who decide to quit smoking. The main categories of methods are:''Each method actually offers several different options. Moreover, combinations of the methods usually are necessary, and no one combination will work for everyone. In fact, it may be necessary to try several different methods or combinations of methods before success is achieved. ''Due to the addictive nature of nicotine, some form of behavioral modification is often necessary for successful cessation of smoking. Educational programs, hypnosis, and aversion therapy (learning how to avoid cigarettes) are a few options. Smokers may be counseled to avoid specific triggers or situations that lead to smoking. For example, instead of awakening and grabbing a cigarette at the bedside or smoking immediately after a meal, people may be encouraged to replace the urge to smoke with another activity, such as, taking a walk or reading a book. ''Numerous medical associations and societies, for example, the American Cancer Society, American ''Heart'' Association, and the American Lung Association, have developed brochures to help smokers quit smoking.

Nicotine replacement therapy to quit smoking,"""Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) became available over the counter in the 1990's. The purpose of nicotine replacement therapy is to substitute another source of nicotine while cigarettes are discontinued. By this means, the habit of smoking is eliminated, even though the addiction to nicotine remains intact. But at the same time, nicotine replacement therapy eliminates the symptoms of withdrawal that can trigger more smoking. In addition, behavioral counseling to change smoking-related behavior usually is necessary. Once cigarettes have been replaced during nicotine replacement therapy, the amount of nicotine is then gradually reduced. ""'Currently, there are different forms of nicotine replacement therapy available ''over-the-counter'' and include: ' nicotine transdermal systems or patches (Nicoderm CQ and Nicotrol), 
	 nicotine 
polacrilex resin or gum (Nicorette), and  nicotine lozenges (Commit). "
Nicotine patches,"'The ''nicotine patch'' (Nicoderm CQ and Nicotrol) contains nicotine that is stored within a specially designed support or matrix. Once applied, the nicotine transdermal system steadily releases nicotine that is absorbed across the skin and into the blood stream. The gum contains nicotine that is released slowly upon chewing and ""parking"". Parking refers to the action of shifting the gum to one side of the cheek after chewing in order to speed the absorption of nicotine. Nicotine lozenges contain nicotine within a hard candy that allows for slow release of nicotine as the candy dissolves in the mouth. A program for slowly weaning users from nicotine replacement products is provided by each product\'s manufacturer. ''The nicotine patch, Nicoderm CQ, is available in three strengths; 21, 14, and 7 mg. People are advised to begin with the 21 mg patch if they smoke more than 10 cigarettes per day or the 14 mg patch if they smoke less than 10 cigarettes per day. After six weeks of wearing the initial patch strength, the next lowest patch strength is worn for two weeks. If therapy was started with the 21 mg patch, an additional two weeks is required for the 7mg patch. A maximum of eight or 10 weeks, depending upon the strength of the first patch used, is recommended for a successful quitting program. The Nicoderm CQ patch can be worn for 16 hours (from awakening until bedtime) or 24 hours if the urge to smoke is great upon awakening. ''Nicotrol is available as a 15 mg patch, and should be worn no more than 16 hours per day. Nicotrol may be worn for up to six weeks. ''The ''side effects commonly seen with patches'' are:' burning,  
itching, or redness at 
the site of the patch,  
headache, 
	 
insomnia, 
	 nervousness,  
dizziness, 
	 
cough, 
	 
rash, 
	 joint 
aches,  
	painful menstruation, 
and  changes in taste. "
Nicorette gum,"'The gum, Nicorette, is available in a variety of flavors in 2 strengths; 4 and 2 mg. Patients are advised to begin with the 4 mg piece of gum if they smoke more than 25 cigarettes per day or the 2 mg piece if they smoke fewer than 7 cigarettes per day. No more than 20 pieces of the 4 mg strength or 30 pieces of the 2 mg strength should be chewed in one day. Initial weaning from treatment should begin after 2 to 3 months and be completed by 4 to 6 months. The most ''common side effects'' with ''Nicorette gum'' are:' aching jaws or soreness of the gums,  changes in taste,  abdominal 
 (gastrointestinal) 
discomfort,  
hiccups,  
	 
nausea, 
	 
vomiting, and 
	 
belching. 
	"
Nicotine lozenges,"""Commit nicotine lozenges are available in 2 or 4 mg doses. One dose consists of one lozenge, and no more than 20 doses should be consumed in one day. The manufacturers of Commit recommend choosing the proper dosage based upon when you usually have the first cigarette of your day. According to the manufacturer's instructions, if you smoke within 30 minutes of getting up in the morning, you should use the stronger 4 mg dose. If not, you should use the 2 mg lozenges. ""'Biting or chewing nicotine lozenges instead of allowing them to dissolve can lead to ''indigestion'' or  ''heartburn''. You should not eat or drink anything while the lozenge is in your mouth. The lozenges will last for about 20-30 minutes when allowed to dissolve in the mouth. The most ''commonly reported side effects with nicotine lozenges'' are:''How effective is nicotine replacement therapy?'' ''Approximately 25% of patients successfully stop smoking with nicotine patch therapy. The success rate with nicotine gum is similar. There have not yet been studies to compare the effectiveness of nicotine lozenges to the patch or gum. The rate of success for nicotine replacement therapy increases 35% to 40% when intensive behavioral counseling is added. ' indigestion,  throat 
 irritation,  soreness of the teeth or gums,  insomnia,  nausea, 
 hiccups,  coughing,  heartburn,  headache, and 
 
flatulence."
"What 
prescription products are available for smoking cessation?","'There are products for cessation of smoking that are available by prescription only. Nicotine for nicotine replacement therapy is available by prescription as an inhaler or nasal spray (Nicotrol Inhaler and ''Nicotrol NS'').These other forms of delivery of nicotine seem to work as well as the nicotine patches or gum. Prescription nicotine replacement products are more expensive than''over-the-counter products''.''Varenicline (Chantix) is a prescription drug approved by the U.S. FDA to help adults quit smoking. Chantix does not contain nicotine, but is believed to act on the same receptors (the sites where nicotine acts to produce its effects) in the brain as nicotine, resulting in activation (stimulation) of these receptors and blocking the ability of nicotine to attach to these receptors. Chantix should be taken seven days prior to the date an individual desires to quit smoking, and most people will keep taking Chantix for up to 12 weeks. ''Side effects of the Chantix may include:''Chantix is not appropriate for use by pregnant and breast-feeding women and people with certain chronic medical conditions.''Bupropion (Zyban) is a medication that is used primarily for treating ''depression''. This drug, however, also has been found to be effective in helping people to quit smoking, and has been approved by the U.S. FDA for use in smoking cessation in adults. ''Other agents that have been tried for cessation of smoking include serotonin reuptake antagonists (''drugs'' also used for ''depression'') and the anti-hypertensive drugs ''clonidine'' (''Catapres'') and calcium channel blockers. Although these agents appear to be less effective than nicotine replacement therapy, they may be effective for some people. '   nausea,  vomiting,  gas,  
constipation, and 
	 changes in dreaming. "
How can nicotine-containing products be used safely?,"'Users of nicotine-containing products should understand that all of these products have side effects as well as effects on other underlying medical conditions such as ''diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'', ''asthma'', and heart disease. Furthermore, these products can have interactions with other prescribed medications such as ''pain'' relievers, blood thinners, and ''high blood pressure'' medications. And finally, they do have their limitations. The following guidelines are to help you safely use these products to achieve your goal of quitting smoking. ' Always read the labels and know the ingredients in 
  the products. Never take more than the recommended dose without checking with 
  your doctor first. 
  If you are pregnant or 
 nursing a baby, seek the 
  advice of a health professional before using any nicotine-containing product. 
  Do not use a nicotine-containing product if you 
  continue to smoke, chew tobacco, use snuff, or other nicotine-containing 
  products. 
  Consult a physician before using nicotine-containing products if you are under 18 years of age 
 and: Have heart disease, an irregular heartbeat, or have 
    had a recent heart attack (Nicotine can 
increase your heart rate.) 
  Have high blood pressure that is not controlled

What are e-cigarettes?,"'e-Cigarettes are smokable, refillable containers or cartridges that contain fluid consisting of solvents, flavors, and varying amounts of nicotine. Inhaling from the devices is known as ""vaping.""  Negative pressure on the cartridge created by inhaling triggers a battery-powered heating and vaporization of the solution. The composition of the fluid in e-cigarettes varies depending upon the manufacturer.' "
Is an e-cigarette harmful?,"'There is little scientific information that determines how safe or unsafe e-cigarettes may be. Nicotine in any form is known to be addictive, and nicotine addiction can develop from using e-cigarettes. Nicotine has been shown to cause adverse health effects including:''More serious effects can occur with high doses of nicotine, such as:''The US Food and Drug Administration has reported that cancer-causing nitrosamines have been detected in some e-cigarettes. Further, poison centers have reported numerous cases of poisonings of small children from consuming the liquid in the cartridges of e-cigarettes.'

	vomiting, 
	 
abdominal pain, and 
	 eye irritation.  increased heart rate,  
high blood pressure, 
	 seizures,  
coma, and 
	 even death. "
Is secondhand smoke from e-cigarettes harmful?,"'e-Cigarettes expel vapors that contain nicotine, which is known to be addictive. Depending on the composition of the fluid in the cartridge, nitrosamines or other dangerous chemicals may also be expelled. It is not known at this time how significant the risk is to the health of those who breathe secondhand vapors from e-cigarettes.''Little is known about the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes, but nicotine has been shown to be harmful to the developing fetus. Nicotine narrows blood vessels and interferes with circulation of blood to the fetus. It can interfere with development of the fetal brain and may harm fetal lung function. It also increases the risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Doctors recommend that pregnant women abstain from both smoking and e-cigarette use. ' "
What is the latest research on smoking?,"'Health care workers have become extremely active in publicizing the negative effects of smoking. In fact, health care workers have been instrumental in passing various legislation to limit smoking in public. As a result, the proportion of people in the US who smoke has dropped from 40.4% in 1965 to around 17% in 2013 (data from the US Department of Health).''This reduction in the percent of people who smoke has been significantly less in women than in men. From 1965 to 2010, smoking among men dropped from 50.2% to 20.5% while during the same period, smoking among women dropped from 31.9% to 15.3%. So, in the future, efforts need to be made to understand and eliminate this difference between the genders.'""One interesting area of the current research on smoking is the study of the population distribution of the genes for smoking (genetic epidemiology). (Genes determine an individual's ""'inherited'' characteristics.) Only a small fraction of individuals who start smoking as an adolescent will actually become nicotine dependent. So, what determines which individuals will become nicotine-dependent? Investigators have found that smoking initiation (the obligatory first step) and the development of nicotine dependence are both influenced by genetic factors. The genetic factors appear to play a larger role in nicotine dependence than in smoking initiation. The next step will be to identify these genes and learn how they work in order to facilitate the development of effective ''prevention'' and treatment strategies for tobacco addiction.''Teen smoking rates remain of concern. In 2011 19% of high school girls and 28% of boys had used some form of tobacco in the prior month.. According to the American Cancer Society, the majority of cigarette use- in almost 90% of people who smoke- begins before a person reaches 18 years of age. Very few people start smoking after age 25. Statistics show that 99% of adult smokers had started by age 26. Education of the at-risk teen population is therefore critical for prevention of tobacco use. Various celebrities and activist groups actively promote campaigns aimed at a teen audience that educate about the consequences of smoking and offer advice on smoking cessation and prevention. While teen smoking rates increased during the 1990s (36% of ''teens'' smoked in 1997), prevention and education campaigns have brought about a decrease in teen smoking in recent years.' "
