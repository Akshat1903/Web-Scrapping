Questions,Answer
What is Fabry disease?,"""Fabry disease is a rare genetic disease a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (a-Gal A) that causes a buildup of a type of fat called globotriaosylceramide (Gb3, or GL-3) in the body. Fabry disease is classified as a type of lysosomal storage disorder. Lysosomes are isolated areas of cells that contain enzymes. In a lysosomal storage disorder these enzymes do not properly metabolize certain fatty molecules. As a result, the undigested fat molecules accumulate and impair a cell's ability to function. In Fabry disease, the alpha-galactosidase A enzymes are deficient and globotriaosylceramide accumulates, which can affect the function of the skin, eyes, gastrointestinal system, kidney, heart, brain, and nervous system.""'Fabry disease is the result of a mutation of the gene responsible for making alpha-galactosidase enzyme, which is located on the X chromosome. Fabry affects mostly males though rarely females may inherit the disease.''Fabry disease is a progressive disorder and symptoms that affect the kidneys, heart, or brain most often occur when patients are age 30 to 45 years.' "
What causes Fabry disease; is it genetic?,"  Fabry disease is a genetic disorder. A genetic disorder is caused by a mutation, or change, in a part of a person's DNA. In Fabry disease, the defective gene is on the X-chromosome, which is one of two sex chromosomes. Sex chromosomes determine a person's gender at birth. Everyone inherits one sex chromosome from each parent. Mothers pass on only X chromosomes while fathers can pass on either an X or a Y chromosome. The chromosome passed on by the father then determines the sex of the offspring: females have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (XY). Fabry disease affects mostly males, who receive one X chromosome with the abnormal gene. Females with Fabry disease also receive one X chromosome with the defective gene, however; since females have two X chromosomes, the normal X chromosome can offer some protection against developing the disorder. Fabry disease is caused by a genetic mutation resulting in a deficiency of an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A (a-Gal A). The genetic defect causes the body to not make enough of this enzyme leading to a buildup of a type of fat called globotriaosylceramide (Gb3, or GL-3) in the body cause the symptoms of Fabry disease. Fabry disease is the result of what is called an X-linked inheritance, that is, the disease is caused by a defect on the X chromosome. X-linked genetic mutations tend to occur mostly in males and rarely in females. If a mother is carrying the defective gene for Fabry disease, both male and female children have a 50% chance of inheriting it from their mother. If the father is carrying the Fabry gene, the female children will inherit the defective gene because the father passes along an X chromosome to them, but the male children, who get a Y chromosome, will not. Females who inherit a defective X chromosome are called carriers and they may pass the genetic mutation on to their male children."
What are the signs and symptoms of Fabry disease?,"'Signs and symptoms include:''Complications of Fabry disease include kidney damage, ''heart disease'' and ''heart attack'', and ''strokes''.'   Episodes of pain and burning sensations in the hands and feet (acroparesthesias) that can be triggered by exercise, stress, fatigue, fever, or changes in weather Small, dark red spots on the skin (angiokeratomas), mostly in clusters from the belly button to the knees Decreased ability to sweat Cloudiness of the front part of the eye Problems with the gastrointestinal system Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) Hearing loss Mitral valve prolapse Abdominal discomfort Frequent bowel movements after eating Joint pain Back pain in the kidney area"
What is the prevalence of Fabry disease?,"'It is estimated that Fabry disease affects 1 in 40,000 males. The prevalence of Fabry disease in females is unknown. It can affect all ethnicities, but it predominantly affects Caucasians. Late-onset forms of Fabry disease, which tend to be milder, are more common than the classic severe form diagnosed earlier in life.' "
Which procedures and tests diagnose Fabry disease?,"'Fabry disease can be difficult to diagnose because it is so rare. The standard test to diagnose Fabry disease is a measurement of leukocyte alpha-Gal A enzyme activity. This test can detect the presence of the mutation for Fabry disease in males, however, it will only identify about 50% of the female carriers.' "
What is the treatment for Fabry disease; is there a cure?,"'Fabry disease may be treated using enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase-alpha (Replagal) or agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme) to help normalize kidney function, ''heart function'', and blood supply to the brain.''Other treatments for Fabry disease are aimed at relieving individual symptoms.''Because Fabry disease can affect many different organs many specialists may be consulted:''Patients may also wish to consult with genetic counselors.'   phenytoin (Dilantin), carbamazepine (Tegretol), or gabapentin (Neurontin) may help prevent episodes of pain and burning sensations (acroparesthesias). Opioids may be prescribed for severe pain. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel (Plavix), and aspirin-dipyridamole (Aggrenox) are prescribed to prevent recurrent ischemic strokes. Warfarin (Coumadin) may be prescribed to prevent cardioembolic strokes. In severe Fabry disease that has progressed to kidney failure, hemodialysis and kidney transplantation may be necessary. Pancrelipase (Ultrase), metoclopramide (Reglan), H2 blockers, such as ranitidine (Zantac), cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), and others, and loperamide (Immodium) can help and soothe relieve gastrointestinal symptoms. ACE inhibitors and/or blockers are prescribed for high levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria) due to kidney damage. Hearing loss may be treated with hearing aids. Patients with high blood pressure (hypertension) may be prescribed antihypertensive medications and they should keep blood pressure under control. High cholesterol should also be treated. In addition to medications, patients should eat a balanced diet, exercise, and avoid smoking. Nephrologist for kidney problems Cardiologist for heart problems Neurologist or neurosurgeon for brain and nervous system symptoms Ophthalmologist for eye problems Gastroenterologist for digestive problems Otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist, or ENT) for hearing problems Additionally, patients may benefit from working with physical therapists, nutritionists, and psychologists to help manage symptoms."
What is the life expectancy for a person with Fabry disease?,"'The life expectancy of males with Fabry disease is about 58 years, and the life expectancy of females with Fabry disease is just over 75 years. The most common cause of death in both genders is ''cardiovascular disease''.' "
What is prosopagnosia?,"'Prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterized by the inability to recognize faces. Prosopagnosia is also known as face blindness or facial agnosia. The term prosopagnosia comes from the Greek words for “face” and “lack of knowledge.” Depending upon the degree of impairment, some people with prosopagnosia may only have difficulty recognizing a familiar face; others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces, while still others may not even be able to distinguish a face as being different from an object. Some people with the disorder are unable to recognize their own face. Prosopagnosia is not related to memory dysfunction, ''memory loss'', impaired vision, or ''learning disabilities''. Prosopagnosia is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus, a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate the neural systems that control facial perception and memory. Prosopagnosia can result from ''stroke'', traumatic ''brain injury'', or certain neurodegenerative diseases. In some cases it is a congenital disorder, present at birth in the absence of any ''brain damage''. Congenital prosopagnosia appears to run in families, which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion. Some degree of prosopagnosia is often present in children with ''autism'' and ''Asperger’s syndrome'', and may be the cause of their impaired social development.\xa0'  "
Is there any treatment?,'The focus of any treatment should be to help the individual with prosopagnosia develop compensatory strategies. Adults who have the condition as a result of ''stroke'' or brain trauma can be retrained to use other clues to identify individuals.'  
What is the prognosis?,"'Prosopagnosia can be socially crippling. Individuals with the disorder often have difficulty recognizing family members and close friends. They often use other ways to identify people, such as relying on voice, clothing, or unique physical attributes, but these are not as effective as recognizing a face. Children with congenital prosopagnosia are born with the disability and have never had a time when they could recognize faces. Greater awareness of ''autism'', and the ''autism'' spectrum disorders, which involve communication impairments such as prosopagnosia, is likely to make the disorder less overlooked in the future.' "
What research is being done?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) conducts research related to prosopagnosia in its laboratories at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and also supports additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure disorders, such as prosopagnosia.' "
What is facelift surgery,"'A facelift is a surgical method that removes excess facial skin to make the face appear younger.  However, the ''aging'' face not only loses skin elasticity and develops looser skin, but also loses fat and muscle tone.  Additional procedures that may be necessary to achieve the best results include: necklift, ''blepharoplasty'' (''eyelid surgery''), ''liposuction'', autologous fat injection, removal of buccal (cheek) fat pad, forehead lift, browlift, chemical or laser peel, and malar (cheek), submalar or ''chin implants''.'  "
How is facelift surgery performed?,"'A traditional facelift procedure is performed through an incision starting in the hair or hairline above and in front of the ear (the temporal region).  The incision is extended downward in front of the ear, comes under the ear and then upward behind the ear ending in the hair or hairline behind the ear. The skin and fatty tissues are then lifted off the underlying muscle and fascia (connective tissue) as far forward as is necessary to correct the loose skin problem.  The underlying muscle and fascia can be tightened with ''sutures'' if the surgeon feels it is necessary. The skin is pulled back and upward and the excess skin removed. The ''wound'' is then closed with sutures and skin staples. Some surgeons leave a drain in the wounds to remove excess blood. Bandages are then applied.  There are surgical techniques which go into deeper tissues rather than under the skin and fat. The results are similar.' "
What are complications of facelift surgery?,"'Although infrequent, the risks and complications of facelift surgery include:'   Bleeding, hematoma, bruising Infection Neurological dysfunction (loss of muscle function or sensation), which is usually temporary Widened or thickened scar Loss of hair (around the incision site) Asymmetry (unevenness between two sides) Skin necrosis (loss of skin from tissue death)"
Summary,"""Facelift is very satisfying to most patients. It achieves a youthful appearance which lasts approximately 10 years. The surgery is performed in an outpatient setting.  This can be done in the outpatient surgi-center or even in a well-equipped physician's office.  ""'Pain'' and discomfort after surgery are minimal. Once the dressings are removed after approximately 3-5 days, the patient can resume social activities using ''makeup'' to cover ''bruising'' and hair over the ears to hide the sutures.' "
What is the facial nerve?,"'The facial nerve is a nerve that controls the muscles on the side of the face. It allows us to show expression, smile, cry, and wink. Injury to the facial nerve can cause a socially and psychologically devastating physical defect; although most cases resolve spontaneously, treatment may ultimately require extensive rehabilitation or multiple procedures.''The facial nerve is the seventh of the twelve cranial nerves. Everyone has two facial nerves, one for each side of the face. The facial nerve travels with the ''hearing'' nerve (the eighth cranial nerve) as it travels in and around the structures of the middle ear. It exits the front of the ear at the stylomastoid foramen (a hole in the skull base), where it then travels through the parotid gland. In the parotid gland it divides into many branches that provide motor function for the various muscles and glands of the head and neck.'  "
What are symptoms of a facial nerve problem?,"'Facial nerve problems may result in facial muscle ''paralysis'', ''weakness'', or twitching of the face. Dryness of the eye or the mouth, alteration of taste on the affected side, or even excessive tearing or salivation can be seen as well. However, the finding of one of these symptoms does not necessarily imply a specific facial nerve problem; the physician needs to make a careful investigation in order to make a precise diagnosis. Symptoms of a facial nerve problem can vary in severity depending upon the extent of the injury to the nerve. Symptoms may range from mild twitching to full paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face.'  "
What conditions affect the facial nerve?,"'There are numerous causes of facial nerve disorder:' Trauma such as birth trauma, skull base fractures, facial injuries, middle ear injuries, or surgical trauma Nervous system disease including stroke involving the brain stem Infection of the ear or face, or herpes zoster of the facial nerve (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) Tumors including acoustic neuroma, schwannoma, cholesteatoma, parotid tumors, and glomus tumors Toxins due to alcoholism or carbon monoxide poisoning Bell's palsy, which is also called idiopathic facial nerve paralysis (see below); this condition is sometimes associated with diabetes mellitus or pregnancy"
How are the causes of facial nerve dysfunction diagnosed?,"'Causes of facial nerve disorder vary from unknown to life threatening. Sometimes, there is a specific treatment for the problem. Accordingly, it is important to investigate why the problem has occurred. The specific tests used for diagnosis will vary from patient to patient, but include:' Hearing tests: Hearing tests are done to assess the status of the auditory nerve. The stapedial reflex test can evaluate the branch of the facial nerve that supplies motor fibers to one of the muscles in the middle ear. Balance tests: Will help find out if part of the auditory nerve is involved. Tear tests: The loss of the ability to form tears may help to locate the site and severity of a facial nerve lesion. Taste tests: The loss of taste in the front of the tongue may help locate the site and severity of a facial nerve lesion. Salivation test: Decreased flow of saliva may help locate the site and severity of a facial nerve lesion. Imaging studies: These tests help determine if there is infection, a tumor, a bone fracture, or any other abnormality. These studies usually include a CT scan and/or a MRI scan. Electrical nerve stimulation tests: Stimulation of the nerve by an electrical current tests whether the nerve can still cause muscles to contract. It can be used to evaluate progression of the disease. For example, if testing indicates equal muscle response on both sides of the face, the patient can be expected to have complete return of facial function in three to six weeks without significant deformity."
What is Bell's palsy?,"'Bell\'s palsy (sometimes referred to as Bell palsy) is paralysis of the facial nerve of unknown cause. The diagnosis is made when no other cause can be identified. Although Bell\'s palsy is thought to be caused by a viral infection of the facial nerve, this hasn\'t been proven. Other names for this condition are ""idiopathic facial palsy"" or Antoni\'s palsy.' "
How does a person get Bell's palsy? ,"""While the actual mechanism of injury of the facial nerve in Bell's palsy is unknown, one proposed mechanism of injury includes:"" Primary viral infection (herpes) sometime in the past. The virus lives in the nerve (geniculate ganglion) from months to years. The virus becomes reactivated at a later date. The virus reproduces and travels along the nerve. The virus infects the cells surrounding the nerve (Schwann cells) resulting in inflammation. The immune system responds to the damaged Schwann cells, which causes inflammation of the nerve and subsequent weakness or paralysis of the face. The course of the paralysis and the recovery will depend upon the degree and amount of damage to the nerve."
Bell's palsy symptoms,"""The typical symptoms of Bell's palsy include:"" Acute unilateral paralysis of facial muscles is present; the paralysis involves all muscles, including the forehead. About half the time, there is numbness or pain in the ear, face, neck or tongue. There is a preceding viral illness in a majority of patients. There is a family history of Bell's palsy in some of patients. Very few patients have bilateral problems. There may be a change in hearing sensitivity (often increased sensitivity)."
Who gets Bell's palsy? How long does it last?,"""Bell's palsy is usually a self-limiting, non-life-threatening condition that resolves spontaneously, usually within six weeks. There is no predominant age or racial predilection; however, it is more common during pregnancy and slightly more common in menstruating females. In general, the incidence increases with advancing age. Children under the age of 13 seem less at risk of developing Bell's palsy than older individuals."" "
How is Bell's palsy treated? How is facial nerve paralysis treated?,"""There are no medications specifically approved to treat Bell's palsy. Underlying medical conditions that lead to facial nerve disorder are treated specifically according to the specific condition that is responsible for the damage to the nerve. Steroid medications (""'corticosteroids'"") are the best treatment for Bell's palsy, and it is recommended that all patients be treated. The usual amount is one milligram per kilogram body weight of ""'prednisone'' (or steroid alternative) per day for 7 to 14 days. Recently, antiviral medications like ''acyclovir'' (''Zovirax'') given in conjunction with steroids have been demonstrated to increase recovery. Doses of the antiviral agent will vary with the drug chosen.'""Although physical therapy and electrotherapy probably have no significant benefit, facial exercises can help prevent contractures of affected muscles. Surgical facial nerve decompression is controversial in Bell's palsy. Some physicians recommend surgical decompression during the first two weeks in patients showing the most severe nerve degeneration; however, there can be a substantial risk of ""'hearing loss'' with this surgery.'  "
Treatment options for eye problems,"'Patients with facial nerve paralysis have difficulty keeping their eye closed because the muscles which close the eye cannot work. Serious complications can occur if the ''cornea'' of the eye becomes too dry. Treatment consists of:' protective glasses which can prevent dust from entering the eye; manual closure of the eye with a finger to keep it moist -- patients should use the back of their finger rather than the tip to insure that the eye is not injured; artificial tears or ointments to help keep the eye lubricated; taping or patching the eye closed with paper tape while asleep; and in cases in which recovery is incomplete, a temporary or permanent narrowing of the eye opening (tarsorrhaphy) may be necessary."
Surgical reconstruction options,"'Reconstructive options for patients with facial muscle weakness or paralysis include one or more of the following:' Nerve repair or nerve grafts: Facial nerve regeneration occurs at a rate of one millimeter per day. If a nerve has been cut or removed, direct microscopic repair is the best option. Nerve transposition: Often the tongue nerve (hypoglossal nerve) or the other facial nerve can be connected to the existing facial nerve. For example, the patient can then train themselves to move their face by moving their tongue. Muscle transposition or sling procedures: The temporalis muscle or masseter muscle (some of the only muscles on the face not supplied by the facial nerve), can be moved down and connected to the corner of the mouth to allow movement of the face. Muscle transfers: Free muscles from the leg (gracilis) can be used to provide both muscle bulk and function. Often a cross facial nerve transposition is done to provide similar nerve supply to the donor muscle flap. Ancillary eyelid or oral procedures: In addition to one of the above, often it is necessary to include a brow lift or facelift, partial lip resection, eyelid repositioning, lower eyelid shortening, upper eyelid weights, or eyelid springs in reconstructive surgery following severe facial nerve palsies."
Is there a cure for Bell's palsy? What is the prognosis for other facial nerve problems?,"""The prognosis for facial nerve damage depends on the underlying cause. Many patients who have required surgery to remove tumors may have unavoidable permanent injury to the facial nerve, whereas a majority of persons who experience Bell's palsy will have complete recovery. The best outcomes occur with rapid diagnosis and treatment."" "
Can Bell's palsy and other facial nerve problems be prevented?,"'At one time it was thought that exposure to ''cold'"" air or a strong wind were predisposing factors leading to idiopathic facial nerve palsy (Bell's palsy); we now know that these ideas were incorrect. As the majority of causes for idiopathic facial nerve problems are unknown, it is difficult to predict with any accuracy specific items to avoid. Choosing a healthy lifestyle to decrease the risk of ""'diabetes'', ''cancer'', or infection may help prevent some cases of facial nerve palsy.' "
Types of Factitious Disorders,"'There are four main types of factitious disorders, including:' Factitious disorder with mostly psychological symptoms: As the 
	description implies, people with this disorder mimic behavior that is 
	typical of a mental illness, such as schizophrenia. They may appear 
	confused, make absurd statements and report hallucinations, the experience 
	of sensing things that are not there; for example, hearing voices. Ganser 
	syndrome, sometimes called prison psychosis, is a factitious disorder that 
	was first observed in prisoners. People with Ganser syndrome have short-term 
	episodes of bizarre behavior similar to that shown by people with serious 
	mental illnesses. Factitious disorder with mostly physical symptoms: People with 
	this disorder claim to have symptoms related to a physical illness, such as 
	symptoms of chest pain, stomach problems, or fever. This disorder is 
	sometimes referred to as Munchausen syndrome, named for Baron von 
	Munchausen, an 18th century German officer who was known for embellishing 
	the stories of his life and experiences. Factitious disorder with both psychological and physical symptoms: 
	People with this disorder produce symptoms of both physical and mental 
	illness. Factitious disorder not otherwise specified: This type includes a 
	disorder called factitious disorder by proxy (also called 
	Munchausen 
	syndrome by proxy). People with this disorder produce or fabricate symptoms 
	of illness in another person under their care. It most often occurs in 
	mothers (although it can occur in fathers) who intentionally harm their 
	children in order to receive attention."
What Are the Symptoms of Factitious Disorders?,"'Possible warning signs of factitious disorders include:' Dramatic but inconsistent medical history Unclear symptoms that are not controllable and that become more 
		severe or change once treatment has begun  Predictable relapses following improvement in the condition Extensive knowledge of hospitals and/or medical terminology, as well 
		as the textbook descriptions of illness  Presence of many surgical scars Appearance of new or additional symptoms following negative test 
		results Presence of symptoms only when the patient is with others or being 
		observed Willingness or eagerness to have medical tests, operations, or other 
		procedures History of seeking treatment at many hospitals, clinics, and doctors 
		offices, possibly even in different cities  Reluctance by the patient to allow health care professionals to meet 
		with or talk to family members, friends, and prior doctors"
What Causes Factitious Disorders?,"'The exact cause of factitious disorders is not known, but researchers are looking at the roles of biological and psychological factors in the development of these disorders. Some theories suggest that a history of abuse or neglect as a child, or a history of frequent illnesses that required hospitalization might be factors in the development of the disorder. ' "
How Common Are Factitious Disorders?,"'There are no reliable statistics regarding the number of people in \t\tthe U.S. who suffer from factitious disorders. Obtaining accurate \t\tstatistics is difficult because dishonesty is common with this \t\tcondition. In addition, people with factitious disorders tend to seek \t\ttreatment at many different health care facilities, which can lead to \t\tstatistics that are misleading. ''In general, factitious disorders are more common in men than in \t\twomen. However, factitious disorder by proxy tends to be more common in \t\twomen than in men. ' "
How Are Factitious Disorders Diagnosed?,"'Diagnosing factitious disorders is very difficult because of, again, \t\tthe dishonesty that is involved. Doctors must rule out other possible \t\tphysical and mental illnesses before a diagnosis of factitious disorder \t\tcan be considered. ''If the doctor finds no physical reason for the symptoms, he or she \t\tmay refer the person to a psychiatrist or psychologist, ''mental health'"" \t\tprofessionals who are specially trained to diagnose and treat mental \t\tillnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use specially designed \t\tinterview and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a factitious \t\tdisorder. The doctor bases his or her diagnosis on the exclusion of \t\tactual physical or mental illness, and his or her observation of the \t\tperson's attitude and behavior. "" "
How Are Factitious Disorders Treated?,""" The first goal of treatment for a factitious disorder is to modify the person's behavior and reduce his or her misuse or overuse of medical resources. In the case of factitious disorder by proxy, the main goal is to ensure the safety and protection of any real or potential victims. Once the initial goal is met, treatment aims to work out any underlying psychological issues that may be causing the person's behavior. \t\t""'The primary treatment for factitious disorders is ''psychotherapy'' (a \t\ttype of counseling). Treatment likely will focus on changing the \t\tthinking and behavior of the individual with the disorder \t\t(cognitive-behavioral therapy). Family therapy may also be helpful in \t\tteaching family members not to reward or reinforce the behavior of the \t\tperson with the disorder. ''There are no medications to treat factitious disorders themselves. \t\tMedication may be used, however, to treat any related disorder -- such \t\tas ''depression'', ''anxiety'', or a personality disorder. The use of \t\tmedications must be carefully monitored in people with factitious \t\tdisorders due to the risk that the ''drugs'' may be used in a harmful way.' "
What Is the Outlook for People with Factitious Disorders?,"'People with factitious disorders are at risk for health problems (or \t\teven death) associated with hurting themselves or otherwise causing \t\tsymptoms. In addition, they may suffer from reactions or health problems \t\trelated to multiple tests, procedures, and treatments; and are at high \t\trisk for ''substance abuse'' and attempts at ''suicide''. A complication of \t\tfactitious disorder by proxy is the abuse and potential death of the \t\tvictims. ''Because many people with factitious disorders deny they are faking \t\tsymptoms and will not seek or follow treatment, recovery is dependent on \t\ta doctor or loved one identifying or suspecting the condition in the \t\tperson and encouraging them to receive proper medical care for their \t\tdisorder and stick with it. ''Some people with factitious disorders suffer one or two brief \t\tepisodes of symptoms and then get better. In most cases, however, the \t\tfactitious disorder is a chronic, or long-term, condition that can be \t\tvery difficult to treat. ' "
Can Factitious Disorders Be Prevented?,'There is no known way to prevent factitious disorders.''WebMD Medical Reference' 
Anal anatomy,"'The anus is the lowest end of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It is the opening through which ''stool'', or fecal matter, normally passes. The anal canal extends from the lower end of the rectum to the skin; this is where anal cancer occurs while ''colorectal cancer'' occurs in the rectum and colon. This canal is surrounded by muscles forming the internal and external anal sphincters that allow us to control when we defecate, or have a bowel movement. The perianal skin surrounds the anus in the perineal region behind either the vaginal orifice or the scrotum.' "
What is anal cancer?,"'The cancer cells arise in areas of the body when some of the cells of a tissue become abnormal in both their gross and microscopic appearance and in their behavior. These ''malignant'' cells can damage adjacent healthy tissue cells by directly invading them. Cancer cells also have the ability to invade blood vessels and lymphatic channels and spread, or ''metastasize'', to other parts of the body.''While anal cancer begins in the anus, people sometime confuse it with ''colorectal'' cancer, which occurs in the colon and/or rectum.'  "
What are the different types of anal cancer?,"'The majority of primary ''cancer of the anus'' are squamous cell carcinomas. Other types of anal cancers include' cloacogenic (also called basaloid or transitional anal cancer), adenocarcinoma of the anal glands, and melanoma (rare)."
What are other types of anal masses or growths?,'Not all growths in the anal region are cancers. A benign growth of tissue on a short stalk is called a pedunculated polyp. A flat-bottomed growth is called a sessile polyp. The sessile polyps are more likely to show ''precancerous'' or cancerous change microscopically.' 
What is fainting?,"'Fainting, ""blacking out,"" or syncope is the temporary loss of consciousness followed by the return to full wakefulness. This loss of consciousness may be accompanied by loss of muscle tone that can result in falling or slumping over. To better understand why fainting can occur; it is helpful to explain why somebody is awake.''The brain has multiple parts, including two hemispheres, the cerebellum, and the brain stem. The brain requires blood flow to provide oxygen and glucose (''sugar'') to its cells to sustain life. For the body to be awake, an area known as the reticular activating system located in the brain stem needs to be turned on, and at least one brain hemisphere needs to be functioning. For fainting or syncope to occur, either the reticular activating system loses its blood supply, or both hemispheres of the brain are deprived of blood, oxygen, or glucose. If blood ''sugar'' levels are normal blood flow must be briefly disrupted to the whole brain or to the reticular activating system for fainting to occur.''Fainting is not caused by head ''trauma'', since loss of consciousness after a head injury is considered a ''concussion''. However, fainting can cause injury if the person falls and hurts themselves, or if the faint occurs while participating in an activity like driving a car.''Fainting is differentiated from ''seizure'', during which the person may lose consciousness.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of fainting?,"'When a person faints they don’t know that they have passed out and fallen to the ground. Afterward, they understand what has happened.''Before the fainting episode the person ''may feel'':'""Pre-syncope or near fainting have the same symptoms, but they don't quite lose consciousness. During the fainting episode, the person may lose conscious, and there may a few twitches, which can be confused with a ""'seizure''.''The person may become confused after waking up, but it should resolve within a few seconds.''After a syncopal episode, the person should return to normal mental function. However, there may be other signs and symptoms of fainting depending on the underlying cause of fainting. For example, if the person is having a ''heart attack'', may complain of ''chest pain'' or pressure.'   Lightheaded Nausea Sweaty Weak Dizzy or the is room spinning (vertigo) Vision may fade or becomes blurred Hearing may be muffled Tingling sensations in the body"
What causes fainting?,"'Fainting causes a decrease in blood flow to the brain because'   The heart fails to pump the blood. The blood vessels don't have enough tone to maintain blood pressure to deliver the blood to the brain. There is not enough blood or fluid within the blood vessels. A combination of reasons one, two, or all three."
Vasovagal (vagal nerve) syncope,"'Vasovagal syncope is one of the most common causes of fainting. In this situation, the balance between the chemicals adrenaline and acetylcholine is disrupted. Adrenaline stimulates the body, including making the heart beat faster and blood vessels narrower, thereby increasing blood pressure. Acetylcholine does the opposite. When the vagus nerve is stimulated, excess acetylcholine is released, the heart rate slows and the blood vessels dilate, making it harder for blood to defeat gravity and be pumped to the brain. This temporary decrease in blood flow to the brain causes the fainting episode.''Pain'' can stimulate the vagus nerve and is a common cause of fainting (vasovagal syncope). Other noxious stimuli can do the same thing, including situational stressors. Commonly, medical and ''nursing'' students faint when observing their first operation, ''autopsy'', or when a person or someone else is bleeding. Some people pass out when they hear bad news; others pass out when they experience the sight of blood or needles. In the Victorian age this was known as a ""swoon.""''Other situations commonly cause the heart rate to temporarily slow and cause a faint. Straining with urination, bowel movement, or ''coughing'' can cause a vagal response, increase acetylcholine levels and decrease blood flow to the brain.' "
"Low blood pressure (postural hypotension), dehydration, and anemia","'Fainting is related to ''pregnancy''. Likely explanations include compression of the inferior vena cava (the large vein that returns blood to the heart) by the enlarging uterus and by ''orthostatic hypotension''.''Low blood pressure'' (orthostatic ''hypotension'')''Blood vessels need to maintain their tone so that the body can withstand the effects of gravity with changes in position. When the body position changes from lying down to standing, the autonomic nervous system (the part of the brain not under conscious control), increases tone in the blood vessel walls, making them constrict, and at the same time increases the heart rate so that blood can be pumped upward to the brain. As people age, blood vessels may become less resilient, and orthostatic ''hypotension'' (relative ''low blood pressure'' with standing) may occur and cause syncope.''Anemia'' (''low red blood cell count'""), whether it occurs acutely from bleeding or gradually for a variety of reasons, can cause fainting because there aren't enough ""'red blood cells'' to deliver oxygen to the brain.''Dehydration'', or lack of water in the body can similarly cause fainting or syncope. This can be caused by excessive ''loss of water'' from ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', ''sweating'', or by inadequate fluid intake. Some illnesses like ''diabetes'' can cause ''dehydration'' by excess loss of water in the urine.' "
Sudden cardiac arrest and heart valve and structural conditions,"'In young people, especially athletes, fainting or syncope can occur because of abnormal thickening of parts of the heart muscle (''hypertrophic cardiomyopathy''). This may obstruct blood when it tries to leave the heart, especially when the heart is asked to beat harder during ''exercise''. Sudden death in athletes may be foreshadowed by episodes of syncope.''Abnormalities with the heart valves can also cause fainting or syncope. The valves allow blood to go in the proper direction when the heart pumps. Valve diseases may include abnormal narrowing (stenosis) or leakage (insufficiency or regurgitation). Either situation can cause issues with maintaining adequate blood flow to the body.'""Structural problems with the heart can cause fainting or syncope, either because there is a problem with the ability of the heart to adequately pump blood or because of valve problems. When the heart muscle becomes damaged or inflamed it may not have the ability to pump blood to meet the body's needs. Examples include a heart attack (""'myocardial infarction'') or ''cardiomyopathy'', in which the heart muscle weakens.' "
Heart rhythm changes (rapid heartbeat and tachycardia) ," Heart rhythm changes are the most common causes of passing out, fainting, or syncope. Frequently, fainting episodes are caused by a temporary change in normal body function. Heart rhythm changes like tachycardia are more dangerous and potentially life-threatening causes of fainting. A rapid heart rate or tachycardia (tachy = fast + cardia = heart) is an abnormal heart rhythm that is generated in either the upper or lower chambers of the heart, and can be life-threatening because the heart beats too fast and may not be enough time for it to fill with blood in between heart beats, which then causes a decrease in the amount of blood that can be delivered to the body. Tachycardias can occur at any age and may not be related to atherosclerotic heart disease."
Vertebrobasilar artery disease,"'Blood vessels to the brain are no different than any other blood vessels in the body and are at risk for narrowing with age, ''smoking'', ''high blood pressure'', ''high cholesterol'', and ''diabetes''. While most people are aware of the carotid arteries that supply the thinking parts of the brain, another set of arteries supply the base of the brain. This vertebrobasilar system is also at risk for narrowing, and should there be a temporary disruption in the blood flow to the midbrain and the reticular activating system, fainting or syncope may occur. The vertebral arteries run to the brain in the back of the neck and are encased in bony tunnels. If blood flow in these arteries is disrupted, the brain stem and reticular activating system may turn off, causing syncope.''Electrolyte'' and hormone abnormalities may also be responsible for syncope; however, these causes are due to their effects on the heart and blood vessels.''Other medications or ''drugs'' may also be potential causes of fainting or syncope including those with ''high blood pressure'' that can dilate blood vessels, ''antidepressants'' that can affect heart electrical activity, and those that affect mental status like ''pain'' medications, ''alcohol'', and ''cocaine''.' "
How are the causes of fainting diagnosed?,"'Many conditions and events cause fainting, for example:' Physical exam Diagnostic tests Heart monitor, for example, a Holter monitor) Electrocardiogram (EKG, ECG) CBC (complete blood count) Glucose levels Kidney function blood tests Thyroid blood tests Tilt-table test CT (computerized tomography) MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)"
"Heart monitors, tilt-table tests, and imaging to diagnose causes of fainting","'Abnormal heart rhythm symptoms may go away shortly, and it is not always evident at time of the examination. Occasionally, a heart monitor (Holter monitor) can be worn as an outpatient for 24 or 48 hours or for up to 30 days (event monitor). ''Abnormal heart rhythms'' and rates may be uncovered as the potential cause of fainting.''A tilt-table test can be used to uncover orthostatic ''hypotension'' and usually is performed on an outpatient basis. The patient is placed at an angle on a table for 30-45 minutes (every institution has its own protocol) and blood pressure and pulse rate are measured with the patient in different positions.''Depending on the suspicions that the doctor and the healthcare team have for the cause of a fainting episode, imaging of the brain may be using computerized tomography (''CT scan'') or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).''Often these tests are normal so a healthcare team presumes that the cause fainting is not life-threatening. However, the doctor and patient will decide whether more testing is needed in the hospital or as an outpatient. In some people, a watchful waiting to decide whether further testing is needed.' "
"Medical history, exams, and heart monitoring to diagnose the causes of fainting","""Patient's medical history: """"As with most medical conditions, the history is the key in finding out why a person faints. Most fainting episodes don't happen when a person is wearing a heart monitor in front of the doctor. Often, people nearby often witness the fainting episode.""'Physical exam: ''The doctor will look for signs or symptoms to help diagnose the cause of the fainting episode.''Causes of fainting can be diagnosed with:''Heart monitoring:'' Heart monitoring may be done to look for heart rhythm disturbances.'   Electrocardiogram (EKG) Screening blood tests, for example: Complete blood count (CBC) Electrolytes Glucose Kidney function tests Thyroid blood tests Low blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension) Blood pressure may be checked both lying and standing to see if the episode was caused by orthostatic hypotension. The heart, lung, and neurologic system may diagnose potential causes if they are abnormal."
What is the treatment for fainting?,"'Fainting is not normal, although the cause may not be serious. If the person is not ''breathing'' or has no pulse, call 911 or go to the nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department. ''If an AED (automated external ''defibrillator'') is available, have a bystander begin CPR.'   If the fainting episode is resolves quickly, and the person returns to normal function with no evidence of injury, it may be appropriate to contact a primary care doctor to discuss care options. Often, if the fainting episode does not go away quickly, the person will be placed on a heart monitor, have intravenous line (IV) fluids, and oxygen supplied. A fingerstick blood sugar may be checked to test for low blood (sugar hypoglycemia). Treatment for the cause of fainting will be tailored to each person."
Can fainting be prevented?,"'Depending upon the cause, there may be opportunity to prevent fainting spells. For example:' People who have had a vasovagal episode may be aware of the warning signs and be able to sit or lie down before passing out and prevent the fainting episode. Older people with orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when sitting or lying down) can be prevented by waiting a few seconds after changing positions, which may be all that is needed to allow the body's reflexes to react. If the episodes are caused by medications, they may be adjusted if they are thought to be the potential cause of fainting. If dehydration is the cause, drinking plenty of fluids may be enough to prevent dehydration. There is an increased awareness of syncope and sudden death in younger athletes due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A variety of screening tests are available to assess potential risk for sudden death, but no consensus yet as to who and when to screen athletes has emerged."
What is a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure whereby the uterus (womb) is removed. This surgery for women is the most common non-obstetrical surgical procedure in the United States.''Approximately 300 out of every 100,000 women will undergo a hysterectomy.'  "
What are the three types of prolapse?,"'A hysterectomy is performed for the treatment of ''uterine cancer'' or very severe pre-''cancers'' (called dysplasia, ''carcinoma in situ'', or CIN III or microinvasive ''carcinoma'' of the cervix). A hysterectomy for ''endometrial cancer'' (uterine lining ''cancer'') is the removal of the ''cancer'' from the body. Hysterectomy is the foundation of treatment for uterine ''cancer''.''The most common reason hysterectomy is performed is for ''uterine fibroids''.''Other common reasons are:''Only 10% of hysterectomies are performed for cancer. This article will primarily focus on the use of hysterectomy for non-cancerous, non-emergency reasons, which can involve even more challenging decisions for women and their doctors.''The most common reason for a hysterecotmy are ''uterine fibroids'' (also known as uterine leiomyomata). ''Uterine fibroids'"" are benign (non-cancerous) growths of the uterus, the cause of which is unknown. Although the majority of them don't cause or turn into uterine cancer""'Uterine fibroids can cause medical problems. Reasons for a hysterectomy in women with uterine fibroids are:''Pelvic relaxation'' is another condition that can require treatment with a hysterectomy. In this condition, a woman experiences a loosening of the support muscles and tissues in the pelvic floor area. Mild relaxation can cause first degree prolapse''There are three types of prolapse:''Second and third degree uterine prolapse must be treated with hysterectomy.''A ''cystocele'', rectocele, or urethrocele can lead to symptoms of, for example:''Urine loss tends to be aggravated by:''Risk factors for pelvic relaxation'':The most common risk factor for pelvic relaxation is childbearing; although, there may be other causes. Avoiding birth and having a caesarean section (''C-section'"") doesn't necessarily eliminate the risk of developing pelvic relaxation."" Abnormal uterine bleeding (vaginal bleeding), Cervical dysplasia (pre-cancerous conditions of the cervix), Endometriosis Urerine prolapse (including pelvic relaxation). Excessive size (usually greater than the size of a two-month pregnancy). Pressure or pain. Bleeding severe enough to cause anemia. First degree prolapse: Mild relaxation can cause, in which the cervix (the uterine opening) is about halfway down into the vagina. Second degree prolapse: In second degree prolapse the cervix or leading edge of the uterus has moved to the vaginal opening. Third degree prolapse: In third degree prolapse, the cervix and uterus protrude past the vaginal opening. Urinary incontinence (unintentional loss of urine) Pelvic heaviness Impaired sexual performance. Sneezing Coughing Jumping Laughing"
What tests or treatments are performed prior to a hysterectomy?,"'A woman must have a pelvic examination, ''Pap smear'', and a diagnosis prior to proceeding with a hysterectomy.''Therefore, a premenopausal (still having regular menstrual periods) woman whose uterine fibroids are causing bleeding but no pain is generally first offered medical therapy with hormones. Non-hormonal treatments are also available, such as ''tranexamic acid'' and more moderate surgical procedures, such as ablations (removal of the lining of the uterus). If she still has significant bleeding that causes major impairment to her daily life, or the bleeding continues to cause ''anemia'' (''low red blood cell count'' due to blood loss), and she has no abnormality on endometrial sampling, she may be considered for a hysterectomy.''A ''postmenopausal'' woman (whose menstrual periods have ceased permanently) who has no abnormalities in the samples of her uterus (endometrial sampling) and still has persistent abnormal bleeding after trying ''hormone therapy'', may be considered for a hysterectomy. Several dose adjustments or different types of hormones may be required to decide on the optimal medical treatment for an individual woman.' Prior to having a hysterectomy for pelvic pain, women might undergo more limited (less extensive) exploratory surgery procedures (such as laparoscopy) to rule out other causes of pain. Prior to having a hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding, women require some type of sampling of the lining of the uterus (biopsy of the endometrium) to rule out cancer or pre-cancer of the uterus. This procedure is called endometrial sampling. Also, pelvic ultrasounds and/or pelvic computerized tomography (CT) tests can be done to confirm a diagnosis. In a woman with pelvic pain or bleeding, a trial of medication treatment is often given before a hysterectomy is considered."
How is a hysterectomy performed?,"   In the past the most common hysterectomy was done by an incision (cut) through the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy). Now most surgeries can utilize laparoscopic assisted or vaginal hysterectomies (performed through the vagina rather than through the abdomen) for quicker and easier recovery. The hospital stay generally tends to be longer with an abdominal hysterectomy than with a vaginal hysterectomy, and hospital charges tend to be higher. The procedures seem to take comparable lengths of time (about two hours), unless the uterus is of a very large size, in which case a vaginal hysterectomy may take longer."
What are the types of hysterectomies?,"'There are now a variety of surgical techniques for performing hysterectomies. The ideal surgical procedure for each woman depends on her particular medical condition. Below, the different types of hysterectomy are discussed with general guidelines about which technique is considered for which type of medical situation. However, the final decision must be made after an individualized discussion between the woman and physician who best understands her individual situation.''Remember, as a general rule, before any type of hysterectomy, women should have the following tests in order to select the optimal procedure:' Complete pelvic exam including manually examining the ovaries and uterus. Up-to-date Pap smear. Pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate, depending on what the physician finds on examination. A decision regarding whether or not to remove the ovaries at the time of hysterectomy. A complete blood count and an attempt to correct anemia if possible. Total abdominal hysterectomy Vaginal hysterectomy Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy Supracervical hysterectomy Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy Radical hysterectomy Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy"
"Total abdominal hysterectomy, the most common type","'The total abdominal hysterectomy\xa0is the most common type of hysterectomy. During a total abdominal hysterectomy, the doctor removes the uterus, including the cervix. The ''scar'' on the abdomen may be horizontal or vertical, depending on the reason the procedure is performed, and the size of the area being treated.' Cancer of the ovary(s) and uterus, endometriosis, and large uterine fibroids are treated with total abdominal hysterectomy. Total abdominal hysterectomy may also be done in some unusual cases of very severe pelvic pain, after a very thorough evaluation to identify the cause of the pain, and only after attempts at non-surgical treatments. Clearly a woman cannot bear children after this procedure, so it is not generally performed on women who desire childbearing unless there is a serious condition, such as cancer. Total abdominal hysterectomy allows the whole abdomen and pelvis to be examined, which is an advantage in women with cancer or investigating growths of unclear cause."
Vaginal hysterectomy procedure,"'During this procedure, the uterus is removed through the vagina. A vaginal hysterectomy is appropriate for conditions such as uterine prolapse, endometrial hyperplasia, or cervical dysplasia.' These are conditions in which the uterus is not too large, and in which the whole abdomen does not require examination using a more extensive surgical procedure. The woman will need to have her legs raised up in a stirrup device throughout the procedure. Women who have not had children may not have a large enough vaginal canal for this type of procedure. If a woman has too large a uterus, cannot have her legs raised in the stirrup device for prolonged periods, or has other reasons why the whole upper abdomen must be further examined, the doctor will usually recommend an abdominal hysterectomy."
Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy,"'Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (''LAVH'') is similar to the vaginal hysterectomy procedure described above, but it adds the use of a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a very thin viewing tube used to visualize structures within the abdomen. Certain women would be best served by having laparoscopy used during vaginal hysterectomy because it allows the upper abdomen to be carefully inspected during surgery. Examples of uses of the laparoscope would be for early endometrial cancer (to verify lack of spread of cancer), or if oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is planned. Just as with simple vaginal hysterectomy without a laparoscope, the uterus must not be excessively large. The physician will also review the medical situation to be sure there are no special risks prohibiting use of the procedure, such as prior surgery that could have increased the risk for abnormal scarring (adhesions). If a woman has such a history of prior surgery, or if she has a large pelvic mass, a regular abdominal hysterectomy might be considered.' "
Supracervical hysterectomy,"'A supracervical hysterectomy is used to remove the uterus while sparing the cervix, leaving it as a ""stump."" The cervix is the area that forms the very bottom of the uterus, and sits at the very end (top) of the vaginal canal (see illustration above). The procedure probably does not totally rule out the possibility of developing cancer in this remnant ""stump."" Women who have had abnormal Pap smears or ''cervical cancer'' clearly are not appropriate candidates for this procedure. Other women may be able to have the procedure if there is no reason to have the cervix removed. In some cases the cervix is actually better left in place, such as some cases of severe ''endometriosis''. It is a simpler procedure and requires less time to perform. It may give some added support of the vagina, decreasing the risk for the development of protrusion of the vaginal contents through the vaginal opening (vaginal prolapse).' "
Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy,"'The laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy procedure is performed like the LAVH procedure, but the uterus is separated from the cervix, and the uterine tissue is removed through the laparoscopic incision. Recovery is generally faster than with other types of hysterectomy. Cervical preservation is less likely to result in menses (''menstruation'') as the inner lining of the cervix is usually cauterized.' "
Radical hysterectomy,'The radical hysterectomy procedure involves more extensive surgery than a total abdominal hysterectomy because it also includes removing tissues surrounding the uterus and removal of the upper vagina. Radical hysterectomy is most commonly performed for early ''cervical cancer''. There are more complications with radical hysterectomy compared to abdominal hysterectomy. These include injury to the bowels and urinary system.' 
Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes),"'Oophorectomy is the surgical removal of the ovary(s), while oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes)is the removal of the ovary and its adjacent Fallopian tube. These two procedures are performed for ''ovarian cancer'', removal of suspicious ovarian tumors, or Fallopian tube cancer (which is very rare). They may also be performed due to complications of infection, or in combination with hysterectomy for cancer. Occasionally, women with ''inherited'' types of cancer of the ovary or breast will have an oophorectomy as preventive (prophylactic) surgery in order to reduce the risk of future cancer of the ovary or breast. Current recommendations are that the fallopian tubes should be removed during hysterectomy even if the ovaries are preserved. This is done to decrease the lifetime risk of ''ovarian cancer'', which can arise from the fallopian tubes in up to 25% of case.' "
What are complications of a hysterectomy?,"'Complications of a hysterectomy include''An abdominal hysterectomy has a higher rate of post-operative infection and pain than does a vaginal hysterectomy.'   infection, pain, and bleeding in the surgical area."
What are the alternatives to a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy for conditions other than cancer generally are not considered until after other less invasive treatments are unsuccessful.' Newer procedures, for example, uterine artery embolization (UAE) or surgical removal of a portion of the uterus (myomectomy), are being used to treat excessive uterine bleeding. Endometrial ablation and newer medications are alternatives."
Should women who have had a hysterectomy continue to have Pap smears?,"'Any woman with a history of abnormal Pap smears should have Pap smears for the remainder of her life. This is because of the low, but real, chance that cervical cancer can recur at the surgical site where the cervix was removed.''In addition, women with a history of abnormal Pap smears, other women who require continued. Pap smears are women with supracervical hysterectomy, where the cervix was left in place. In this situation, in contrast to the woman who has had hysterectomy for reasons of cervical cancer, the woman who has had supracervical hysterectomy will be able to follow the same screening guidelines as for other women who have not had surgery. For example, the physician may stop doing Pap smears at age 65 if the woman has been well-screened and has always had normal Pap smears.''Women who do not need to continue having Pap smears are those who have had vaginal hysterectomy or abdominal hysterectomy for benign (not cancer) reasons, such as uterine fibroids. If they have had normal Pap smears prior to the procedure, they need not continue to have Pap smears after their surgery.' "
What are antinuclear antibodies?,"'We normally have antibodies in our blood that repel invaders in our bodies, such as virus and bacteria microbes. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are unusual antibodies, detectable in the blood, that have the capability of binding to certain structures within the nucleus of the cells. The nucleus is the innermost core within the body\'s cells and contains the DNA, the primary genetic material. ANAs are found in patients whose immune system may be predisposed to cause inflammation against their own body tissues. Antibodies that are directed against one\'s own tissues are referred to as autoantibodies. The propensity for the immune system to work against its own body is referred to as autoimmunity. ANAs suggest the possible presence of autoimmunity. Therefore, when they are detected in a patient\'s blood (referred to as a ""positive"" result), doctors will consider the possibility that an autoimmune illness exists in that patient.''Autoimmune diseases are conditions in which there is a disorder of the immune system characterized by the abnormal production of antibodies (autoantibodies) directed against the tissues of the body. Autoimmune diseases typically feature inflammation of various tissues of the body. Frequently, ANAs are found in patients with a number of different autoimmune diseases, such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'"", Sjögren's syndrome, ""'rheumatoid arthritis'', ''polymyositis'', ''scleroderma'"", Hashimoto's ""'thyroiditis'', juvenile ''diabetes mellitus'', Addison disease, ''vitiligo'', ''pernicious anemia'', glomerulonephritis, and ''pulmonary fibrosis''. ANAs can also be found in patients with conditions that are not considered classic autoimmune diseases, such as chronic infections and ''cancer''.' "
Who created the ANA test? How do health care professionals perform the procedure?,"'The ANA test was designed by Dr. George Friou in 1957. The ANA test is performed using a blood sample. An ANA test is performed by testing the blood in the laboratory. The antibodies in the serum of the blood are exposed in the laboratory to cells. It is then determined whether or not antibodies are present that react to various parts of the nucleus of cells. Thus, the term anti-""nuclear"" antibody. Fluorescence techniques are frequently used to actually detect the antibodies in the cells, thus ANA testing is sometimes referred to as fluorescent antinuclear antibody test (FANA).' "
What is the interpretation of the ANA screen result?,"'The ANA test is a sensitive screening test used to detect autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases feature a misdirected immune system, and each of them has characteristic clinical manifestations that are used to make the precise diagnosis. The interpretation or identification of a positive ANA test does not make a diagnosis. It simply suggests to the doctor to consider the possibility that an autoimmune disease is present.'  "
What non-autoimmune conditions produce ANAs?,"'ANAs can be produced in patients with infections (virus or bacteria), lung diseases (primary ''pulmonary fibrosis'', ''pulmonary hypertension''), gastrointestinal diseases (''ulcerative colitis'"", Crohn's disease, ""'primary biliary cirrhosis'', alcoholic ''liver disease'""), hormonal diseases (Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroiditis, """"Grave's disease""'), blood diseases (''idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura'', hemolytic ''anemia''), ''cancers'' (''melanoma'', breast, lung, kidney, ovarian and others), skin diseases (''psoriasis'', pemphigus), as well as in the elderly and those people with a family history of rheumatic diseases.'  "
Can medications cause elevated ANAs?,"'Many medications can sometimes stimulate the production of ANAs, including ''procainamide'' (Procan SR), ''hydralazine'' (''Apresoline''), and ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin''). ANAs that are stimulated by medication are referred to as drug-induced ANAs. This does not necessarily mean that any disease is present when these ANAs are ""induced."" Sometimes diseases are associated with these ANAs, and they are referred to as drug-induced diseases.' "
ANAs are defined as having patterns. What does this mean?,"'ANAs present different ""patterns"" depending on the staining of the cell nucleus in the laboratory: homogeneous or diffuse pattern; speckled pattern; nucleolar pattern; and peripheral or rim pattern. While these patterns are not specific for any one illness, certain illnesses can more frequently be associated with one pattern or another. The patterns then can sometimes give the doctor further clues as to types of illnesses to look for in evaluating a patient. For example, the nucleolar pattern is more commonly seen in the disease ''scleroderma''. The speckled pattern is seen in many conditions and in people who do not have any autoimmune disease. These patterns are determined by technical experts who routinely interpret the tests.' "
Are ANAs always associated with illness? What is the normal range?,"""No. ANAs can be found in approximately 5% of the normal population, usually in low titers (low levels). These people usually have no disease. Titers of 1:80 or lower are less likely to be significant. (ANA titers of less than or equal to 1:40 are considered negative.) Even higher titers are often insignificant in patients over 60 years of age. Ultimately, the ANA result must be interpreted in the specific context of an individual patient's symptoms, underlying medical conditions, and other test results. It may or may not be significant, even if positive, in a given individual."" "
Introduction,"'About 1 in 4 people in the U.S. have ''hyperopia'' or ''farsightedness'', but fortunately there are more ways to correct this eye disorder than ever before.''People with hyperopia or ''farsightedness'' have difficulty focusing on objects close up, such as print in a book. More severe hyperopia would also cause problems with seeing objects in the distance clearly, such as highway signs.''The occurrence of hyperopia increases with age; At least half of all persons over the age of 65 have some degree of farsightedness.' "
What Causes Farsightedness?,"'Hyperopia is a refractive error, like ''astigmatism'' and ''nearsightedness'' (''myopia''). Having a refractive error means that light rays bend incorrectly into your eye to transmit images to the brain. Farsightedness occurs when light entering the eye focuses behind the retina, instead of directly on it. An abnormally flat ''cornea'' or short eye can cause the light to enter the eye this way.''Hyperopia often runs in families. It is often present at birth; however, many children outgrow it.' "
What Are the Symptoms of Farsightedness?,"'Symptoms of farsightedness may include:''If you experience these symptoms of hyperopia while wearing your glasses or ''contact lenses'', you may need a new prescription.' Headaches Eye strain Difficulty concentrating or focusing on nearby objects Fatigue or headache after performing a close task such as reading"
How Is Farsightedness Diagnosed?,'Farsightedness can be easily diagnosed by a basic eye exam given by your eye doctor.' 
How Is Farsightedness Corrected?,"'To correct hyperopia you must change the way the light rays bend when entering your eye. Glasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery can all be used to correct farsightedness.''Depending on the extent of your farsightedness, you may need to wear your glasses or contact lenses at all times, or only when you need to see objects up close, like when reading or sewing. With hyperopia, your prescription is a positive number, such as +3.00. The higher the number, the stronger your lenses will be.'""If wearing contacts or glasses isn't for you, refractive surgery can reduce or even eliminate your dependence on glasses or contact lenses. The most common procedures to correct hyperopia include:""'An even newer procedure for correcting mild hyperopia is the implantation of ''plastic'' corneal rings called Intacs, which also alter the shape of the cornea. One advantage of the rings is that they can be left in place permanently, or they may be removed in case of a problem or adjusted should a prescription change become necessary.''Talk to your eye doctor about which treatment is best for you.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.' PRK. During a photorefractive keratectomy a laser is used to flatten the cornea so that light rays can focus closer to, or even on the retina. LASIK. During laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, a flap is cut through the top of the cornea, a laser removes some corneal tissue, and then the flap is dropped back into place. LASIK is the most common surgery used to correct farsightedness."
What is fatigue? What does it feel like?,"'Fatigue can be described as the lack of energy and motivation (both physical and mental). This is different than drowsiness, a term that describes the need to ''sleep''. Often a person complains of feeling tired and it is up to the health care professional to distinguish between fatigue and drowsiness, though both can occur at the same time. Aside from drowsiness, other symptoms can be confused with fatigue including ''shortness of breath'' with activity and muscle ''weakness''. Again, all these symptoms can occur at the same time. Also, fatigue can be a normal response to physical and mental activity; in most normal individuals it is quickly relieved (usually in hours to about a day, depending on the intensity of the activity) by reducing the activity.''Fatigue is a very common complaint and it is important to remember that it is a symptom and not a disease. Many illnesses can result in the complaint of fatigue and they can be physical, psychological, or a combination of the two.''Often, the symptom of fatigue has a gradual onset and the person may not be aware of how much energy they have lost until they try to compare their ability to complete tasks from one time frame to another. They may presume that their fatigue is due to ''aging'' and ignore the symptom. This may lead to a delay in seeking care.''While it is true that ''depression'' and other psychiatric issues may be the reason for fatigue, it is reasonable to make certain that there is not an underlying physical illness that is the root cause.''Individuals with fatigue may have three primary complaints; however, it can vary in each person.''While fatigue can last for a prolonged period of time, the presence of ''chronic fatigue'' is different than ''chronic fatigue syndrome'', which has specific set of two criteria set for by the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' as follows:''Other words that a person might use to describe fatigue may include:' There may be lack of motivation or the ability to begin an activity; the person tires easily once the activity has begun; and the person has mental fatigue or difficulty with concentration and memory to start or complete an activity. Have severe chronic fatigue for at least six months or longer with other known medical conditions (whose manifestation includes fatigue) excluded by clinical diagnosis; and Concurrently have four or more of the following symptoms: post-exertional malaise impaired memory or concentration unrefreshing sleep muscle pain multi-joint pain without redness or swelling tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes sore throat headache lethargic, listless, lack of energy, tired, worn out, weary, exhausted, malaise, or feeling run down."
What causes fatigue?,"""There are numerous potential causes of fatigue as a major complaint. They range from those that cause poor blood supply to the body's tissues to illnesses that affect metabolism, from infections and inflammatory diseases to those that cause ""'sleep'' disturbances. Fatigue is a common side effect of many medications. While numerous patients with psychological conditions often complain of fatigue (physical and mental), there are also a group of patients where the cause of fatigue is never diagnosed.''The following table summarizes some common causes of fatigue but is not meant to be comprehensive:'

What are the signs and symptoms of fatigue?,"'Fatigue is a symptom of an underlying disease and is described in many ways from feeling weak to being constantly tired or lacking energy.''There may be other associated symptoms depending upon the underlying cause.''It is important that the health care professional consider the complaint of fatigue in the context of the whole patient to try to come to an accurate causative diagnosis.'   Individuals with heart disease, lung disease, or anemia may complain of associated shortness of breath or tiring easily with minimal activity. Persons with diabetes may complain of polyuria (excess urination), polydypsia (excess thirst), or change of vision. Those who have hypothyroidism may also have symptoms of feeling cold, dry skin and brittle hair."
Is there a test to diagnose fatigue?,"'The key to finding the cause of fatigue in a patient is the care the health care professional takes in compiling a medical history. It is important to ask questions not only about the loss of energy but also about other potential problems that the patient may be experiencing such as shortness of breath, ''sleep'' patterns, ''hair loss'', color of the stools, or any of the myriad of questions that might provide information as to what organ system may be involved.''Usually, a history is taken by the health care professional asking questions about the quality and quantity of fatigue. Examples of some of the questions the health care professional may ask include:''Other associated symptoms with fatigue include:'""It is also appropriate for the health care professional to ask questions about the patient's social situation and to also ask about their psychologic state of mind. ""'Alcohol'' and ''drug abuse'' screening questions should be expected as routine.''Because fatigue is such a non-specific symptom, each answer may direct the health care professional to explore a different potential cause.''A full physical examination is important to look for underlying signs of illness. The general appearance of the patient is important looking for hygiene, vital signs, and evidence of ''anxiety'' or agitation. Examination and evaluation of the different systems of the body (''heart'', ''lungs'', abdomen, neurological system, etc.) and combining any abnormal findings with the clues found in the history taking may help make the diagnosis.''Special attention may be taken to palpate (feel) for an abnormal thyroid gland, ''swollen lymph nodes'', listen for abnormal heart sounds including murmurs and to check for normal muscle tone and reflexes.''Depending on the findings in the history and physical examination, blood tests and other imaging studies may be ordered. Initial screening blood tests may include:''CPK and ESR screening tests are rarely done initially. The decision to obtain ''X-rays'', ''CT scans'', ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG'', ''EKG'"") and other imaging or testing will depend upon the individual patient's circumstances and what the health care practitioner suspects may be the underlying cause of the fatigue.""   Does the patient feel well in the morning when they wake? Does the fatigue progress through the day? Does the person nap unexpectedly or take excessive amounts of stimulants such as caffeine to complete daily activities? Does the fatigue come on gradually or abruptly? Is it a daily occurrence or intermittent/periodic? What makes it better and what makes it worse? How has the patient's life changed because of the fatigue? Is the fatigue more mental than physical? weight loss, chest pain and shortness of breath, vomiting and diarrhea, fevers and chills, muscle weakness or pain, and/or anxiety and depression. CBC (complete blood count that includes a red blood cell, white blood cell and platelet count); electrolytes (sodium potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, and sometimes calcium and magnesium); glucose (blood sugar); BUN/creatinine (to measure kidney function); TSH or thyroid stimulating hormone; monospot; ferritin; tests for deficiencies in vitamins B12, D, folic acid, and iron; CPK (elevated in illnesses that cause muscle inflammation); and/or ESR or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (non specific blood marker for inflammation in the body)."
What is the treatment for fatigue?,"'Since fatigue is a symptom of an underlying condition, the treatment depends upon the condition that is causing the fatigue, regardless of whether it is physical, psychological or a combination of the two.''There may be a lag time between when the illness has been treated and the intensity of fatigue symptoms; some symptoms may resolve as soon as the underlying condition is treated. For example, individuals who are ''anemic'' feel much better as soon as their red blood cell count increases, while those recovering from ''infectious mononucleosis'' may require weeks to have their energy levels return to normal.'  "
Can fatigue be prevented?,"'Fatigue as a symptom can occur as the result of many causes and therefore, prevention is not an issue. More importantly, the early recognition of fatigue will allow a person to seek medical care and potentially have an earlier diagnosis of the underlying cause made.''Sometimes, symptoms like fatigue arise gradually and it is difficult for the person to realize that there is a problem. It may take an outside perspective from a friend or family member to appreciate a difference in function. Self-awareness of gradual decline in body performance is often difficult as a person makes repeated small accommodations to complete daily activities.'  "
What is fatty liver disease? What is nonalcoholic liver disease (NASH)?,"'Fatty liver is a condition in which the cells of the liver accumulate abnormally increased amounts of fat. Although excessive consumption of ''alcohol'' is a very common cause of fatty liver (alcoholic fatty liver), there is another form of fatty liver, termed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), in which alcohol has been excluded as a cause. In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, other recognized causes of fatty liver that are less common causes than alcohol also are excluded.''Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a manifestation of an abnormality of metabolism within the liver. The liver is an important organ in the metabolism (handling) of fat. The liver makes and exports fat to other parts of the body. It also removes fat from the blood that has been released by other tissues in the body, for example, by fat cells, or absorbed from the food we eat. In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the handling of fat by liver cells is disturbed. Increased amounts of fat are removed from the blood and/or are produced by liver cells, and not enough is disposed of or exported by the cells. As a result, fat accumulates in the liver.''Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is classified as either fatty liver (sometimes referred to as isolated fatty liver or IFL) or steatohepatitis (NASH). In both isolated fatty liver and NASH there is an abnormal amount of fat in the liver cells, but, in addition, in NASH there is inflammation within the liver, and, as a result, the liver cells are damaged, they die, and are replaced by ''scar tissue''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of fatty liver disease?,"'Fatty liver disease rarely causes symptoms until the liver disease is far advanced. Doctors usually find or suspect fatty liver when ''abnormal liver tests'' appear in routine blood testing, fat is seen in the liver when ''ultrasonography'' of the abdomen is performed for other reasons, for example, the diagnosis of ''gallstones'', and infrequently when the liver is enlarged on physical examination of a patient.''When the liver disease is far advanced (cirrhosis), signs and symptoms of cirrhosis predominate. These include:'   Excessive bleeding due to the inability of the liver to make blood-clotting proteins Jaundice due to the inability of the liver to eliminate bilirubin from the blood Gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension that increases the pressure in intestinal blood vessels Fluid accumulation due to portal hypertension that causes fluid to leak from blood vessels and the inability of the liver to make the major blood protein, albumin Mental changes (encephalopathy) due to the liver's inability to eliminate chemicals from the body that are toxic to the brain. Coma may occur. Liver cancer"
What causes NASH?,"'The cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is complex and not completely understood. ''The most important factors appear to be the presence of obesity and ''diabetes''.'' It used to be thought that obesity was nothing more than the simple accumulation of fat in the body. Fat tissues were thought to be inert, that is, they served as simply storage sites for fat and had little activity or interactions with other tissues. We now know that fat tissue is very active metabolically and has interactions and effects on tissues throughout the body.''When large amounts of fat are present as they are in obesity, the fat becomes metabolically active (actually inflamed) and gives rise to the production of many hormones and proteins that are released into the blood and have effects on cells throughout the body. One of the many effects of these hormones and proteins is to promote ''insulin resistance'' in cells.''Insulin'' resistance is a state in which the cells of the body do not respond adequately to insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin is important because it is a major promoter of glucose (''sugar'') uptake from the blood by cells. At first, the pancreas compensates for the insensitivity to insulin by making and releasing more insulin, but eventually it can no longer produce sufficient quantities of insulin and, in fact, may begin to produce decreasing amounts. At this point, not enough ''sugar'' enters cells, and it begins to accumulate in the blood, a state known as diabetes. Although sugar in the blood is present in large amounts, the insensitivity to insulin prevents the cells from receiving enough sugar. Since sugar is an important source of energy for cells and allows them to carry out their specialized functions, the lack of sugar begins to alter the way in which the cells function.''In addition to releasing hormones and proteins, the fat cells also begin to release some of the fat that is being stored in them in the form of fatty acids. As a result, there is an increase in the blood levels of fatty acids. This is important because large amounts of certain types of fatty acids are toxic to cells.''The release of hormones, proteins, and fatty acids from fat cells affects cells throughout the body in different ways. Liver cells, like many other cells in the body, become insulin resistant, and their metabolic processes, including their handling of fat, become altered. The liver cells increase their uptake of fatty acids from the blood where fatty acids are in abundance. Within the liver cells, the fatty acids are changed into storage fat, and the fat accumulates. At the same time, the ability of the liver to dispose of or export the accumulated fat is reduced. In addition, the liver itself continues to produce fat and to receive fat from the ''diet''. The result is that fat accumulates to an even greater extent.'  "
Can obesity and diabetes cause NASH?,"'Obesity and diabetes have important roles in the development of fatty liver. Whereas one third of the general population (which includes obese and people with diabetes) may develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, more than two thirds of people with diabetes develop nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Among patients who are very obese and undergoing surgery for their obesity, the majority have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Moreover, whereas the risk of NASH is less than 5% among lean persons, the risk is more than a third among the obese. Fatty liver increases both in prevalence as well as severity as the degree of obesity increases. The increases begin at weights that are considered ''overweight'' - i.e., less than obese.' "
Can metabolic syndrome cause NASH?,"'Metabolic syndrome is a syndrome defined by the association of several metabolic abnormalities that are believed to have a common cause. These metabolic abnormalities result in obesity, elevated blood ''triglycerides'', low density lipoprotein (LDL or ""bad"" ''cholesterol'') and high density lipoprotein (''HDL'') cholesterol, ''high blood pressure'', and elevated blood sugar (diabetes).''Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is considered a manifestation of metabolic syndrome and thus occurs frequently with the other manifestations of the syndrome. Occasionally, it may occur without the other abnormalities of the syndrome.' "
Can alcohol or drug abuse cause NASH?,"'Several identifiable causes of fatty liver that are not nonalcoholic fatty liver disease so often causes ''confusion''. The most common causes of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are excessive alcohol consumption and ''hepatitis C'"". Other causes of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease include Wilson's disease, ""'lipodystrophy'' (a disease of fat storage), starvation, intravenous ''nutrition'', and abetalipoproteinemia (a disease of fat transport).''Several drugs also cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, for example cortilcosteroids, ''tamoxifen'' (''Nolvadex''), and ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall'').' "
Can NASH occur in children?,"'Since the current epidemic of obesity begins in childhood, it is not surprising to find that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease occurs in children. Only a few studies are available, but the estimated prevalence among children 2-19 years of age is approximately 10%, the prevalence increases with the degree of obesity, and there is progression to cirrhosis. Although there is concern about nonalcoholic fatty liver disease among children, there is not enough evidence of benefit of treatment, and, therefore, no general recommendation has been made to screen overweight and obese children for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It is recommended, however, that children with suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in whom the diagnosis is not clear should have a liver biopsy. Children should not be started on any drug treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease without a biopsy showing NASH. Although there have not been studies in children to support the recommendations, loss of weight and ''exercise'' are the recommended treatment for children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.' "
Is fatty liver disease serious?,"'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is important for several reasons, ''it is a common disease, and is increasing in prevalence, NASH is an important cause of serious liver disease, leading to cirrhosis and the complications of cirrhosis - liver failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and liver ''cancer''. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with other very common and serious non-liver diseases, perhaps the most important being cardiovascular disease that leads to ''heart disease'' and ''strokes''. Fatty liver probably is not the cause of these other diseases, but is a manifestation of an underlying cause that the diseases share. Fatty liver, therefore, is a clue to the presence of these other serious medical conditions, which need to be addressed.' "
What procedures and tests diagnose NASH?,"'Fatty liver generally does not cause symptoms or signs, and any symptoms and signs are more likely to be due to the accompanying diseases such as obesity, diabetes, ''vascular disease'', etc. In anyone with obesity or diabetes, fatty liver should be suspected. In a minority of patients, abnormal ''liver tests'' are found on routine blood testing although the abnormalities usually are mild. Probably the most common method by which nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is diagnosed is by imaging studies like ultrasonography, ''computerized tomography'' (CT), and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''); that are obtained for reasons other than diagnosing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease also may be discovered when patients develop complications of the liver disease - cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer - due to the presence of NASH.''It is not possible to distinguish between isolated fatty liver and NASH with imaging studies. Although a combination of several blood tests has been suggested as a means of separating the two, and tests are being developed to identify NASH, biopsy of the liver is the best means to differentiate between the presence of fat, or fat and inflammation (NASH). Although the majority of individuals will have isolated fatty liver and not NASH, it is important to identify patients with NASH, because of the need to look for complications of liver disease and to enter these patients into trials of treatment with the hope of preventing progression of the liver disease. Patients with the metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes are good candidates to undergo biopsy of the liver since the incidence of NASH is higher among these groups.''One of the difficulties in diagnosing NASH as the cause of severe scaring or cirrhosis is that as the scaring progresses to cirrhosis, the fat disappears. This results in a condition that is referred to as ''cryptogenic cirrhosis'', cirrhosis in which there is no clear cause. (Specifically, in cryptogenic cirrhosis the two most common causes of cirrhosis - alcohol and ''viral hepatitis'' - are not involved.) Cryptogenic cirrhosis has puzzled physicians for many years as to its cause. However, it now appears that half of cryptogenic cirrhosis occurs in patients with obesity and/or diabetes and probably is due to NASH.' "
What is the treatment for NASH?,"'Treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease includes lifestyle changes (exercise, ''weight loss'', diet), medications, ''supplements'' and antioxidantsOmega-3 fatty acids, surgery, and liver transplantation.' "
Which foods and supplements should be avoided? Can you drink alcohol?,"'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been associated in human or animal studies with reduced amounts of unsaturated ''fats'' (a diet high in saturated fat) and increased amounts of fructose (which is most commonly added to the diet as high-fructose ''corn'' syrup). Benefits of increasing unsaturated fat (a diet lower in saturated fat, and higher unsaturated fat) and reducing high fructose ''corn'' syrup on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease have not been demonstrated; however, there is little harm in doing so, especially since there may be benefits of these dietary modifications unrelated to the liver.''An interesting observation - though unexplained - is that there is less scarring (fibrosis) in the livers of patients with NASH who drink more than two cups of coffee per day. (Scarring or fibrosis is the process that ultimately leads to cirrhosis.) Similar benefits of coffee have been associated with lesser degrees of liver disease in both alcoholic cirrhosis and ''hepatitis C''. It is not unreasonable to recommend drinking coffee in moderate amounts in view of the lack of harmful side effects.''Vitamin D deficiency'' is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Although there is no reason to think that this deficiency contributes to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it is reasonable to measure ''vitamin D'' levels in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and treat them with ''vitamin D'' if they are deficient.''There is no evidence of harmful effects of light alcohol consumption (two or fewer ''drinks'' per day for men, one or fewer for women) on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease though there also is no evidence that it is safe. Everyone, including individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease should avoid drinking large amounts of alcohol.'  "
Weight loss and exercise for NASH,"'Since the serious complications of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are primarily seen in patients with NASH, treatment of NASH is of great importance. Unfortunately, there are no clearly effective treatments for these patients. One of the difficulties in identifying effective treatments is the need for long-term studies since the progression of NASH to cirrhosis and its complications occurs slowly. Several treatments have resulted in a reduction of fat in the liver, but few have shown that the progression of NASH is slowed.''Weight loss'' and exercise are among the most promising of treatments for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It does not take large amounts of weight loss to result in a decrease in liver fat. A less than 10% decrease in weight may be enough. Vigorous exercise results in a reduction of liver fat and may reduce the inflammation of NASH. The long-term effects of weight loss and exercise on the important development of cirrhosis and its complications are unknown. Nevertheless, now, the best theoretical approach to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is weight loss and vigorous exercise. Unfortunately, only a minority of patients are able to accomplish these.' "
Medications and other treatment options,"'There are no drugs that are approved for the treatment of fatty liver or NASH.''Metformin'' (''Glucophage'') is a drug used for treating diabetes. It works by increasing the insulin sensitivity of cells, directly counteracting the insulin resistance that accompanies nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as well as the metabolic syndrome. It has been studied but, unfortunately, has not been found clearly to improve the liver injury associated with NASH.''''Pioglitazone'' (''Actos'') and ''rosiglitazone'' (''Avandia'') are drugs that treat diabetes because they increase insulin sensitivity. They are most used among patients with diabetes for control of their diabetes. There has been a reduction in liver fat and signs of liver injury with both drugs, and pioglitazone might reduce the scarring that results from the inflammation of NASH. Two problems that occur with treatment are ''weight gain'' and, with rosiglitazone, an increase in ''heart attacks''. Pioglitazone may be used to treat NASH; however, it needs to be recognized that its long-term effectiveness and safety have not been well-established.''Vitamin E'' has been studied in NASH because of its general effects of opposing inflammation. It has been shown to reduce liver fat and inflammation and possibly fibrosis, but its long-term effectiveness and safety have not been well-studied. Moreover, treatment of patients with vitamin E who do not have NASH is associated with a higher mortality and ''prostate cancer''. Vitamin E can be used for treating NASH, but it should be used selectively (not in all patients), and patients should understand the potential risks.''Pentoxifylline'' (''Trental'') has been studied for the treatment of NASH in small groups of patients with encouraging results; however, there is not enough experience or knowledge of its effectiveness and safety to recommend treatment outside of research studies.''Small studies have shown some benefit with ''omega-3''-fatty acids in reducing liver fat in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and larger studies are underway. In large groups of individuals (not selected because of the presence or absence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), omega-3-fatty acids were shown to reduce cardiovascular events such as ''heart attacks'' and overall mortality. Therefore, omega-3-fatty acids may be appropriate treatment for patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and the metabolic syndrome because these patients have a high incidence of cardiovascular disease and death.''Lipid''-lowering drugs, specifically the ''statins'' and ''ezetimibe'' (''Zetia''), have been used to treat the abnormal blood ''lipids'' associated with the metabolic syndrome. Although there is evidence of beneficial effects of these drugs on the liver in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, there is not enough experience to recommend them in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease unless they are primarily being used for treating abnormal blood lipids.''Ursodeoxycholic acid (''Ursodiol'') has been studied in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease but has been abandoned because of its ineffectiveness and concerns about toxicity at very high doses.'  "
Bariatric surgery,"'Bariatric surgery is surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that results in loss of weight, and there are several different types of bariatric surgery. Since obesity is believed to be an important factor in the causation of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and loss of weight has been shown to have beneficial effects on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it is not surprising that bariatric surgery has been considered as a potential treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Only one study has reported the effects of bariatric surgery on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and has demonstrated that fat and inflammation decrease, and progression from mild fibrosis to more severe fibrosis is arrested. (Patients with more severe fibrosis were not studied and, therefore it is not known if the progression from more severe fibrosis also is arrested.) Nevertheless, because appropriate studies to determine both the benefits and risks of bariatric surgery have not been done, it is recommended that bariatric surgery should not be used as a treatment for NASH. Instead, patients should be selected for surgery irrespective of the presence or absence of NASH.' "
Liver transplantation,"'Once a liver has become cirrhotic and complications have developed, the options for treatment are either treating the complications as they arise or to replace the diseased liver with a transplanted liver. In fact, NASH has become the third most common cause of transplanting livers, only surpassed by alcoholic liver disease and ''hepatitis C'', but it is expected to climb to the number one position due to the epidemic of obesity and diabetes that is occurring in the U.S. Unfortunately, NASH recurs frequently in the transplanted liver and then progresses to cirrhosis, presumably because the underlying causes - obesity and diabetes continue.' "
What are the complications of NASH?,"'The complications of nonalcoholic liver disease are essentially those of NASH that has progressed to cirrhosis and include liver failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and liver cancer.' "
What diseases are associated with NASH?,"'The diseases of the metabolic syndrome that are associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease have already been discussed. Other associations exist including fatty pancreas, ''hypothyroidism'', ''colon polyps'', elevated blood uric acid, ''vitamin D'' deficiency, polycystic ovary disease (PCOD), and obstructive ''sleep apnea''.''For example, half of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease have obstructive ''sleep apnea'', and most patients with obstructive ''sleep'' apnea have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Associations do not prove causation, and in most cases, it is not clear why the associations exist--whether the associations are due to a causal relationship or they reflect an underlying common cause.' "
What is the relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and heart disease?,"'Cardiovascular disease, especially ''heart attacks'' and strokes, is commonly seen in patients with fatty liver. In fact, cardiovascular ''causes of death'' occur more frequently than liver-related deaths. Whereas the components of the metabolic syndrome are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been found to be a risk factor that is independent of the metabolic syndrome, increasing the risk two-fold. Since the means of treating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are limited, it is important that the manifestations of the metabolic syndrome - obesity, diabetes, ''high blood pressure'', dyslipidemia (abnormalities of fats or lipids in the blood) be aggressively treated.' "
What is the difference between nonalcoholic fatty liver and steatohepatitis (NASH)?,"'As discussed previously, the difference between isolated, nonalcoholic fatty liver and steatohepatitis (NASH) is the presence of inflammation and damage to the liver cells in NASH; in both, the liver has increased amounts of fat. Although about a third of the general population has fatty liver, approximately 10% have NASH. Approximately one third of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease have NASH. Although fatty liver and NASH appear to arise under the same conditions, it does not appear that fatty liver progresses to NASH. Thus, whether a patient is to develop fatty liver versus NASH is determined very early during the accumulation of fat, although it is unclear what factors determine this. It is believed that the inflammation and damage of liver cells are caused by the toxic effects of the fatty acids released by fat cells, but fatty acids in the blood are elevated in both fatty liver and NASH. Perhaps the difference is explained by genetic susceptibility as suggested by preliminary data.''The consequences of fat in the liver depend greatly on the presence or absence of inflammation and damage in the liver, i.e., whether there is fat alone or NASH is present. Isolated fatty liver does not progress to important liver disease. NASH, on the other hand, can progress through the formation of ''scar'' (fibrous tissue) to cirrhosis. The complications of cirrhosis, primarily gastrointestinal bleeding, liver failure, and liver cancer, then may occur.' "
Seizure symptoms: how to assist the victim,"'Seizures'' occur because the brain becomes irritated and an ""electrical storm"" occurs. This ""electrical storm"" occurs because the normal connections between the cells in the brain do not function properly. This causes the brain to try to shut down because of the electrical surge. The muscle shaking occurs because the brain is ending out signals to every muscle group, asking them to contract. Most ''seizures'' are self-limiting and are followed by a so-called postictal period, in which the brain can be considered to ""reboot and restart"" all its programs, similar to a computer when it is rebooted.''Seizures are a common event, and 4% of people will experience one in their lifetime. The potential to have a ''seizure'' depends upon the threshold of the brain to withstand excess electrical activity. In infants and children, high ''fevers'' can cause this threshold to lower, resulting in febrile seizures. A blow to the head can cause an electrical spike causing a ''seizure'', and sometimes seizures just happen. ''The patient needs evaluation to look for the reason for the seizure. Is there an infection? Are there ''electrolyte'' abnormalities in the blood? Is there a structural problem in the brain? Often there is no obvious reason why the first seizure occurred, and CT or ''MRI'' scans of the brain as well as an ''EEG'' (''electroencephalogram'') may be ordered to look for a cause. ''Most people get a ""freebie"" seizure before requiring medication (medication should not necessarily be prescribed for every person who has had one seizure), but that doesn\'t mean that the event should be ignored. The chance of having another seizure sometime in the future is approximately 20%, and that is the reason why it is required that people need to be seizure free for 3-6 months before being allowed to drive a vehicle (the required time varies between states), scuba dive, sky dive, or participate in other potentially risky situations in which a seizure could put the individual or others in danger.''Generalized seizures are frightening to witness. There is ''loss of consciousness''; the body stiffens, arches, and may shake; and grunting sounds may be heard. But most seizures stop themselves and the role of the Good Samaritan, bystander, friend, or family is to protect the individual from themselves. ''Steps to take if you witness an individual having a seizure include:' The first step is to take a deep breath and try to stay calm. Make certain that there is nothing nearby that can be struck by the person having the seizure. Don't hold the person down. A seizure is a violent and forceful event, and bystander injury is a possibility. Do not put anything in the victim's mouth. A person who is seizing can't swallow their tongue and usually are breathing adequately. Forcing open the jaw can break teeth or get fingers bitten. If the individual's seizure lasts more than 3-5 minutes, call 911 immediately. After the seizure stops, lay the person on their side and stay with them until they are awake or until medical assistance arrives."
NIH on what are febrile seizures?,'Febrile seizures are convulsions brought on by a ''fever'' in infants or small children.' 
How common are febrile seizures?,"'Approximately one in every 25 children will have at least one febrile seizure, and more than one-third of these children will have additional febrile seizures before they outgrow the tendency to have them. Febrile seizures usually occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years and are particularly common in toddlers. Children rarely develop their first febrile seizure before the age of 6 months or after 3 years of age. The older a child is when the first febrile seizure occurs, the less likely that child is to have more. '  "
What are the symptoms of a febrile seizure?,"'During a febrile seizure, a child often loses consciousness and shakes, moving limbs on both sides of the body. Less commonly, the child becomes rigid or has twitches in only a portion of the body, such as an arm or a leg, or on the right or the left side only. Most febrile seizures last a minute or two, although some can be as brief as a few seconds while others last for more than 15 minutes.''The majority of children with febrile seizures have rectal temperatures greater than 102 degrees F. Most febrile seizures occur during the first day of a '""child's fever""'. Children prone to febrile seizures are not considered to have ''epilepsy'', since ''epilepsy'' is characterized by recurrent seizures that are not triggered by ''fever''.'  "
What makes a child prone to recurrent febrile seizures?,"""A few factors appear to boost a child's risk of having recurrent febrile seizures, including young age (less than 15 months) during the first seizure, frequent ""'fevers'', and having immediate family members with a history of febrile seizures. If the seizure occurs soon after a fever has begun or when the temperature is relatively low, the risk of recurrence is higher. A long initial febrile seizure does not substantially boost the risk of recurrent febrile seizures, either brief or long. ' "
Are febrile seizures harmful?,"'Although they can be frightening to parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures are harmless. During a seizure, there is a small chance that the child may be injured by falling or may choke from food or saliva in the mouth. Using proper ''first aid for seizures'' can help avoid these hazards (see section entitled ""What should be done for a child having a febrile seizure?"").''There is no evidence that febrile seizures cause ''brain damage'"". Large studies have found that children with febrile seizures have normal school achievement and perform as well on intellectual tests as their siblings who don't have seizures. Even in the rare instances of very prolonged seizures (more than 1 hour), most children recover completely.""'Between 95 and 98 percent of children who have experienced febrile seizures do not go on to develop ''epilepsy''. However, although the absolute risk remains very small, certain children who have febrile seizures face an increased risk of developing epilepsy. These children include those who have febrile seizures that are lengthy, that affect only part of the body, or that recur within 24 hours, and children with ''cerebral palsy'"", delayed development, or other neurological abnormalities. Among children who don't have any of these risk factors, only one in 100 develops epilepsy after a febrile seizure."" "
What should be done for a child having a febrile seizure?,"'Parents and caregivers should stay calm and carefully observe the child. To prevent accidental injury, the child should be placed on a protected surface such as the floor or ground. The child should not be held or restrained during a ''convulsion'"". To prevent choking, the child should be placed on his or her side or stomach. When possible, the parent should gently remove all objects in the child's mouth. The parent should never place anything in the child's mouth during a convulsion. Objects placed in the mouth can be broken and obstruct the child's ""'airway''. If the seizure lasts longer than 10 minutes, the child should be taken immediately to the nearest medical facility. Once the seizure has ended, the child should be taken to his or her doctor to check for the source of the fever. This is especially urgent if the child shows symptoms of ''stiff neck'', extreme lethargy, or abundant ''vomiting''. ' "
How are febrile seizures diagnosed and treated?,"'Before diagnosing febrile seizures in infants and children, doctors sometimes perform tests to be sure that seizures are not caused by something other than simply the fever itself. For example, if a doctor suspects the child has ''meningitis'' (an infection of the membranes surrounding the brain), a ''spinal tap'' may be needed to check for signs of the infection in the cerebrospinal fluid (fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord). If there has been severe ''diarrhea'' or ''vomiting'', ''dehydration'"" could be responsible for seizures. Also, doctors often perform other tests such as examining the blood and urine to pinpoint the cause of the child's fever.""""A child who has a febrile seizure usually doesn't need to be hospitalized. If the seizure is prolonged or is accompanied by a serious infection, or if the source of the infection cannot be determined, a doctor may recommend that the child be hospitalized for observation."" "
How are febrile seizures prevented?,"'If a child has a fever most parents will use fever-lowering ''drugs'' such as ''acetaminophen'' or ''ibuprofen'' to make the child more comfortable, although there are no studies that prove that this will reduce the risk of a seizure. One preventive measure would be to try to reduce the number of febrile illnesses, although this is often not a practical possibility.''Prolonged daily use of oral anticonvulsants, such as phenobarbital or valproate, to prevent febrile seizures is usually not recommended because of their potential for side effects and questionable effectiveness for preventing such seizures.''Children especially prone to febrile seizures may be treated with the drug ''diazepam'' orally or rectally, whenever they have a fever. The majority of children with febrile seizures do not need to be treated with medication, but in some cases a doctor may decide that medicine given only while the child has a fever may be the best alternative. This medication may lower the risk of having another febrile seizure. It is usually well tolerated, although it occasionally can cause drowsiness, a lack of coordination, or ''hyperactivity''. Children vary widely in their susceptibility to such side effects.' "
What research is being done on febrile seizures?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS), a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), sponsors research on all forms of febrile seizures in medical centers throughout the country. NINDS-supported scientists are exploring what environmental and genetic risk factors make children susceptible to febrile seizures. Some studies suggest that women who smoke or drink ''alcohol'' during their ''pregnancies'' are more likely to have children with febrile seizures, but more research needs to be done before this link can be clearly established. Scientists are also working to pinpoint factors that can help predict which children are likely to have recurrent or long-lasting febrile seizures.''Investigators continue to monitor the long-term impact that febrile seizures might have on intelligence, behavior, school achievement, and the development of epilepsy. For example, scientists conducting studies in animals are assessing the effects of seizures and anticonvulsant drugs on brain development.''Investigators also continue to explore which drugs can effectively treat or prevent febrile seizures and to check for side effects of these medicines.'

Bowel incontinence (fecal incontinence) definition,"'Fecal incontinence'' can be defined as the unintentional loss of ''stool'' (feces) or ''gas'' (flatus). It is often due to a failure of one or more of the components that allow the body to control the evacuation of feces, when it is socially appropriate.''A normal bowel movement requires a complex interaction and feedback system between the nerves and muscles of the rectum and anus. The anatomy of this area is complicated. The rectum is a reservoir for holding ''stool'"". Two sphincters or circular muscles separate the rectum from the anus and control when the anus should allow a bowel movement. The internal anal sphincter (IAS) is under involuntary control of the body's nervous system, while the external anal sphincter (EAS) can be actively controlled by the indivdiual. In addition, the puborectalis muscle tugs at the junction of the rectum and anus, creating a 90 degree angle, which makes it harder for stool to move involuntarily into the anus.""'When the rectum is full and for a normal bowel movement to occur, the IAS relaxes just a little. Cells in the anus can detect feces or flatus and if the brain says that it is an opportune social time to pass gas or have a bowel movement, the puborectalis muscle relaxes, straightening the path from the rectum to the anus. Squatting or sitting helps increase the pressure within the abdomen, and muscles that surround the rectum squeeze its contents, the EAS relaxes and a bowel movement occurs.''If it is not an appropriate time to open the bowel, the puborectalis muscle contracts, the EAS contracts, the rectum relaxes and stool is forced back into the upper part of the rectum, causing the urge to have a bowel movement to be temporarily quieted.' "
What causes bowel incontinence?,"'Fecal incontinence'' occurs because of an underlying disease or illness (it is not considered a ""disease""). There are numerous potential causes and many patients have more than one reason to cause loss of bowel control.'   Damage to muscles and nerves may occur directly at the time of vaginal childbirth or after anal or rectal surgery. Neurologic diseases such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and spina bifida can be potential causes of fecal incontinence. Complications of diabetes can also cause peripheral nerve damage leading to incontinence. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) and irritable bowel disease may develop fecal incontinence. Stool seepage is different than fecal incontinence. Minor staining can occur in people who have hemorrhoids, rectal fistula, rectal prolapse and poor hygiene. Other causes include chronic diarrhea, parasite infections, and laxative abuse. Paradoxical diarrhea or overflow incontinence may occur is a a person who has chronic constipation. In paradoxical diarrhea, stool fills the rectum, hardens and becomes impacted. Liquid stool leaks around the fecal mass, imitating incontinence."
What are the symptoms of bowel incontinence?,"'Bowel incontinence refers to the inability to control the passage of small amount of stool, liquid or solid, or control flatus.''People are sometimes reluctant to discuss their lack of bowel control because of the social stigma attached to it. Their initial complaint might be'   anal itching (pruritis ani), a buttock skin infection, or breakdown of the skin and ulcers."
How is bowel incontinence diagnosed?,"'Taking a history is very important and the health care professional will spend time learning about how often loss of bowel control occurs, in what situations and whether it is solid, liquid, or gas. Past medical and surgical history is important, especially obstetric history or surgery of the anus, including ''hemorrhoids''. It could be several years before the complication of a surgery or ''childbirth'' lead to fecal incontinence. Dietary habits and medications (including ''over-the-counter'' medications and ''laxative'') will also be considered and evaluated.''Physical examination will likely include a rectal examination to assess sphincter tone. In females, a ''pelvic exam'' will also be performed.''While blood tests are not usually needed to make the diagnosis, other tests may be helpful in deciding the potential cause of fecal incontinence. Anal manometry measures the pressure within the rectum, both at rest and when the patient squeezes the anal sphincter. Nerve and muscle conduction studies may be considered. ''Ultrasound'' can evaluate the anal sphincters and look for muscle damage.' "
What is the treatment for bowel incontinence?,"'The treatment approach for a patient with fecal incontinence is individualized based upon the underlying cause. The purpose is to regulate bowel movements, decrease their frequency, and increase stool firmness and consistency. Nonsurgical and surgincal treatments are often recommended for bowel incontinence, these include:'   DietEat 20 to 30 grams of fiber per day. This can make stool more bulky and easier to control.Avoid caffeine. This may help prevent diarrhea.Drink several glasses of water each day. This can prevent constipation. Eat 20 to 30 grams of fiber per day. This can make stool more bulky and easier to control. Avoid caffeine. This may help prevent diarrhea. Drink several glasses of water each day. This can prevent constipation. Medications such as Imodium, Lomotil, or Hyoscyamine should help make liquid stool more solid and easier to control. Increasing the strength of the muscles of the pelvic floor might be helpful. Kegel exercises and electrical stimulation may be recommended. Biofeedback is often used to help retrain the anal sphincters and have the patient appreciate the sensation of rectal fullness that comes just before the need to defecate. If the incontinence persists even after maximum medical therapy has been attempted, surgery may be an alternative. If damaged, attempts can be made to repair the muscles of the pelvic floor including the external anal sphincter. The internal anal sphincter function may be enhanced by injecting materials like silicone, carbon beads, or collagen. As a last resort, where all other options have failed, a colostomy may be performed, where the colon is diverted through the abdominal wall to empty into a removable bag."
What about bowel incontinence in children?,"'In children, fecal incontinence (also called ''encopresis'') is often due to chronic ''constipation'' and overflow incontinence or diarrhea. By definition, there should be at least one inappropriate bowel movement per month for at least three months in a child older than age 4 years. The incontinence usually happens during the day and not at night.'  Most often, the diagnosis is made by history and physical examination by the health care professional and further testing is not needed. Treatment is directed at developing a more routine bowel evacuation schedule and may require changes in diet, behavior modification, and the addition of stool bulking agents."
Can bowel incontinence be prevented?,"'Maintaining sphincter tone may prevent fecal incontinence. This might include preventing constipation by increasing fiber in the diet and keeping well hydrated and avoiding straining to promote a bowel movement.''Unfortunately, many times the cause of incontinence is ''childbirth'' anal surgery. It may be years until the symptoms of incontinence arise.' "
What is the prognosis for bowel incontinence?,"'The frequency of fecal incontinence increases with age. Once it occurs, the patient may be able to control the symptoms with diet, medication, and''exercise''. Many patients may initially benefit from surgery, but that benefit gradually decreases over the years and incontinence may recur.' "
What is a fecal occult blood test?,"'Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) is testing that is performed on samples of ''stool'' in order to detect occult blood (blood that is not visible to the naked eye) in otherwise normal-colored ''stool''. Fecal occult blood usually is a result of slow (often intermittent) bleeding from inside the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract. The slow bleed does not change the color of the stool or result in visible bright red blood. Therefore, the blood is found only by testing the stool for blood in the laboratory. Occult bleeding has many of the same causes as other forms of more rapid gastrointestinal bleeding, such as ''rectal bleeding'' (passage of red blood and/or ''blood clots'' rectally) and melena (black tarry stool as a result of bleeding from the upper ''intestines'' such as ulcers). Please read the ''Rectal Bleeding'' article for a more detailed explanation of different patterns of gastrointestinal bleeding. ' "
Why is fecal occult blood testing done?,"'A fecal occult blood test is done primarily to detect\xa0''colon cancer'' in people without intestinal symptoms. ''Cancers'' of the colon are common and frequently produce fecal occult blood long before they cause other symptoms such as ''abdominal pain'', rectal bleeding, or changes in bowel habits. In addition, some precursors of colon ''cancer'', specifically, some types of ''colon polyps'', also may bleed slowly and cause fecal occult blood. By finding the cancers early through fecal occult blood testing when the cancers are small and before they ''metastasize'' (spread to distant organs), patients may be cured of their cancers by removing them surgically. By removing ''precancerous'' polyps that are found through fecal occult blood testing, ''cancer'' may be prevented.'  "
How is a fecal blood test performed?,"'For fecal occult blood testing, several (usually three) samples of stool are collected for testing.  The reason for testing multiple samples is that bleeding from cancers and polyps often is intermittent and only one of the samples may show blood.''There are two types of fecal occult blood testing, 1) chemical and 2) immunologic.'  Chemical testing: For chemical testing, a solution containing the chemical guaiac and an oxidizing chemical is used.  If blood is present in the sample of stool, the mixing of the solution with blood causes the guaiac to turn visibly blue.  The blue color is caused by the interaction (promoted by the oxidizing agent) of the heme portion of the hemoglobin molecule, the oxygen carrying molecule in red blood cells, and the guaiac. Immunologic testing: For immunologic testing, a sample of stool is mixed with a solution that contains an antibody to globin, the protein part of the hemoglobin molecule.   The antibody is combined with a small amount of gold.  When the antibody/gold complex binds to the globin in stool, the antibody/gold/globin complex settles out of the solution as a visible line on the test strip."
How do the results of chemical fecal occult blood testing compare with immunologic fecal occult blood testing?,"'A chemical fecal occult blood test is inexpensive and easy, but it has several disadvantages.''The immunologic fecal occult blood test has additional advantages over the chemical fecal occult blood test.  First, it is more sensitive for blood.  This means that given the same amount of ''blood in the stool'', the immunologic fecal occult blood test will more frequently be abnormal.  In other words, it will more frequently detect cancers and precancerous polyps.  Second, it is more specific for blood.  That is, there will be fewer abnormal tests due to interfering substances in the ''diet'', and as a result, an abnormal immunologic fecal occult blood test will more commonly be due to ''cancer'' or a precancerous polyp.  As a result, less follow-up testing (for example, ''colonoscopy'') will be necessary to pursue a falsely abnormal fecal occult blood test.'  Substances in fruits and vegetables can mimic heme and cause chemical fecal occult blood tests to be falsely positive, that is, falsely abnormal.  Therefore, it is necessary to restrict certain fruits and vegetables before and during the collection of stool samples. Unlike heme which can travel intact from the stomach or small intestine and into the stool, globin is destroyed in the small intestine.  As a result, a positive chemical fecal occult blood test can be caused by bleeding anywhere in the stomach or intestines, but a positive immunologic fecal occult blood test only occurs when there is bleeding into the colon.  Therefore, it is necessary to restrict red meat containing hemoglobin before and during the collection of stool samples or the heme from the ingested meat will cause a falsely positive test. Some drugs commonly cause small amounts of bleeding into the stomach or small intestine.  Moreover, vitamin C and a few other drugs can cause an abnormal chemical fecal occult blood tests.  Therefore, these drugs must be stopped before and during the collection of samples."
How effective are fecal occult blood tests?,"'The true bottom line for a fecal occult blood test is how many cancers or precancerous polyps can be detected and, ultimately, how many cancer-related deaths can be prevented by fecal occult blood tests.  Large studies with chemical fecal occult blood tests have demonstrated at least a 15%-20% reduction in mortality due to colon cancer.  Similar studies are now underway with immunologic fecal occult blood tests, and, based on factors discussed previously, the results are expected to be better.  Nevertheless, the results of these ongoing studies are necessary to demonstrate what the bottom line truly is for immunologic fecal occult blood tests. ' "
How should fecal occult blood tests be used?,"'Fecal occult blood tests offer an important screening modality for colon cancer, but, because it detects only a minority of cancers and precancerous polyps, by itself it is not sufficient.  It needs to be complemented by endoscopic examination of the colon, either ''sigmoidoscopy'' and/or colonoscopy.  ''Recommendations for the age at which fecal occult blood tests and endoscopic examinations should be initiated, and the frequency with which they should be repeated depend on the risk for colon cancer.  Patients who are older, have relatives with colon cancer, have had polyps previously, or have diseases that are associated with a higher risk for colon cancer may have testing that begins earlier and is done more frequently.  '""The use of fecal occult blood tests has only one downside. Tests can be falsely positive, that is, tests that show blood in patients who don't have colon cancer or ""'premalignant'' polyps.  Every test showing blood requires the performance of colonoscopy, an expensive procedure that carries a small but definite risk of serious complications.  The more frequently tests are falsely positive, the more frequently unnecessary colonoscopies are performed.  If studies underway (discussed previously) demonstrate an increased ability to diagnose cancer and colon polyps with a reduced frequency of these falsely positive tests, there will be clear advantages for immunologic over chemical fecal occult blood tests. ''For this reason, immunologic fecal occult blood tests have advantages over chemical fecal occult blood tests since it has fewer false positive tests.''It is important to remember that having occult blood in the stool does not automatically imply that one has colon cancer or a polyp. There are many causes of occult  blood in the stomach, small intestine, or colon, most of which are benign. Some examples include bleeding from use of ''aspirin'' or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (for example, ''ibuprofen''), ulcers, ''esophagitis'', ''colitis'', and intestinal angiodysplasias (weakened clusters of blood vessels on the surface of intestinal linings). Therefore, patients with stools containing occult blood should be evaluated by physicians to exclude cancers and polyps, as well as to identify other causes of intestinal bleeding.' "
What is excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)?,"'The word ''hidrosis'' is derived from the Greek and simply means ""sweat."" Hyperhidrosis, excessive sweat or excessive sweating, produces a lot of embarrassment and unhappiness. Primary hyperhidrosis occurs in otherwise healthy individuals with no apparent cause. Secondary hyperhidrosis is much less common and can be due to certain ''drugs'', a variety of serious systemic diseases, neurological disorders, facial surgery, and ''anxiety''. Of the approximately 3% of Americans who suffer from excessive sweating, 50% involve the underarms (axillary hyperhidrosis). Underarm problems tend to start around ''puberty'', while palm and sole sweating may begin earlier, often during childhood. Untreated, these problems may continue throughout life.''Sweating is embarrassing, stains clothes, and may complicate business and social interactions. Excessive sweat can have serious practical consequences, like making it difficult to hold tools, grip a steering wheel, or shake hands.'  "
What is the cause of excessive sweating?,"'Otherwise healthy people with excessive sweating have primary hyperhidrosis. Heat and emotions may trigger hyperhidrosis in some, but many who suffer from hyperhidrosis perspire nearly all the time, regardless of their mood or the weather.''Secondary hyperhidrosis can be caused by medications such as ''dopamine'' agonists, ''antidepressants'', antipsychotics, ''alcohol'', and ''insulin''. Systemic disorders such as ''diabetes mellitus'', ''hyperthyroidism'', '""Parkinson's""' disease, and tumors such as ''pheochromocytoma'' and ''lymphoma'' have been associated with secondary hyperhidrosis.'  "
What signs and symptoms accompany hyperhidrosis?,"'Generally, the only sign of excessive sweating is the presence of abundant moisture in the anatomical area affected. The presence of this moisture can predispose to skin infections.''As stated above, there are a number of conditions and diseases that produce secondary hyperhidrosis. Treating the underlying condition can help relieve at least some of the excessive sweating.''The word ''hidrosis'' is derived from the Greek and simply means ""sweat."" Hyperhidrosis is excessive sweat.''Dermatologists are physicians specialized in diagnosing and treating ''skin conditions''. Dermatologists diagnose and treat this condition.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose hyperhidrosis?,"""The diagnosis is made clinically on the basis of a patient's history and physical examination. If the sweating is excessive and constant, then the diagnosis is obvious. It is not unusual that one must rely on the patient's history to determine the diagnosis. Research centers measure sweat production by comparing the weight of filter paper left on the skin for a specified interval before and after sweating.""'Dermatologists are physicians specialized in diagnosing and treating skin conditions. Dermatologists diagnose and treat this condition.' "
What are medical treatment options for hyperhidrosis?,"'Through a systematic evaluation of causes and triggers of excessive sweating, followed by a judicious, stepwise approach to medical treatment, many people with this annoying disorder can achieve improved quality of life. The decision on initial treatment depends upon the severity of the condition and the anatomical areas that are affected.''The approach to treating hyperhidrosis generally proceeds as follows:''When regular antiperspirants fail, as they often do, to remedy hyperhidrosis, most doctors start by recommending aluminum chloride hexahydrate (''Drysol'', various generics), a prescription-strength version of aluminum chloride. It is applied just before bedtime seven to 10 nights in a row, then roughly once a week as a maintenance medication. The aluminum salts in this preparation collect in the sweat ducts of the patient and block them. Over time, the excessive ''perspiration'"" may diminish to such an extent that no further treatment is needed. This method works reasonably well for many patients whose problem is excessive underarm sweating, but it's not satisfactory for most of those with clammy palms and sweating of the soles of the ""'feet''.''The main side effect with aluminum chloride is irritation, which can sometimes, but not always, be overcome by reducing the frequency of use or applying anti-inflammatory medications such as lotions containing hydrocortisone.'""Iontophoresis was introduced over 50 years ago to treat excessive sweating. Its exact mechanism of action is still unclear. The procedure uses water to conduct an electric current to the skin, which combats the production of sweat. The current is applied typically for 10-20 minutes per session, initially with two to three sessions per week followed by a maintenance program of treatments at one- to three-week intervals, depending upon the patient's response. Iontophoresis treatments sound painful but in fact are not.""""Patients purchase devices for this treatment through a doctor's prescription. There are three iontophoresis devices that are registered with and cleared by the U.S. FDA; the R.A. Fischer and the Hidrex USA devices require a prescription, whereas the Drionic device is available without a prescription. They work best on palms and soles but can be adapted for use in the underarms. Medical insurers sometimes cover the cost.""'Oral anticholinergic drugs such as ''glycopyrrolate'' (''Robinul''), ''oxybutynin'', and ''propantheline'' bromide can be quite effective for this condition, but they can produce side effects like ''dry mouth'', ''insomnia'', and ''blurred vision''. The dosage should be titrated carefully.''Topical anticholinergic pads''Recently, a new topical treatment using glycopyrronium tosylate impregnated gauze pads (Qbrexza) has received approval for the treatment of axillary (armpit) hyperhidrosis.''Botulinum toxin (Botox), a muscle poison much in the news as a cosmetic treatment for ''wrinkles'', has actually been used in many areas of medicine for some time, such as in the treatment of ''muscle spasms'' and certain types of ''headaches''. Its latest medical use is for treating excessive underarm sweating.''Botox is injected into tissues of the armpit or hand. The drug works by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, which is the chemical that activates sweat glands. This may produce approximately six months of relief from sweating. The injections are uncomfortable, but use of a very small needle minimizes discomfort.''Now that this treatment option has received FDA approval, many health insurers are providing coverage for the injections and the Botox itself, which is quite costly.''Currently, the FDA has not approved Botox for treating sweating of the palms and soles of the feet, though some physicians are administering it as an off-label use, with some success. Drawbacks of using this treatment for the palms and soles are ''pain'', requiring ''nerve blocks'' to numb the hands in order to make the injections tolerable, and the potential for temporary muscle ''weakness''.'""These new techniques produce energy that presumably destroys sweat glands while preserving other tissues. Currently, only the armpits seem to be appropriate treatment sites. Treatments occur in a doctor's office and in recent studies have been accompanied by local swelling and irritation as well as a variety of other relatively minor side effects. Sweating seems to be significantly decreased for a time with these treatments. How these would be used in other anatomical areas aside from the armpits is not clear.""   Over-the-counter antiperspirants: Patients usually try home remedies like these first because they are readily available. Antiperspirants containing aluminum chloride (for example, Certain-Dri) may be more effective when other antiperspirants have failed. So-called ""natural"" antiperspirants are often not very helpful for patients. Prescription-strength antiperspirants: those containing aluminum chloride hexahydrate Iontophoresis: a device that uses a direct current to drive ions into the sweat gland using tap water occasionally mixed with aluminum ions or other substances Oral medications: from the group of medications known as anticholinergics, which reduce sweating Topical medicated pads: pads impregnated with anticholinergic medications for use in the armpits Botox (botulinum toxin): approved in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating excessive axillary sweating Microwave destruction: a device destroys the sweat glands, purportedly causing minimal damage to other tissues Surgery: paraspinal sympathectomy, or interruption of certain nerve pathways, as a last resort"
Are there home remedies for hyperhidrosis?,"'Over-the-counter antiperspirants may be effective, but usually the patient has already tried these.' "
Can surgery treat hyperhidrosis? What are potential side effects of surgery for hyperhidrosis?,"'Localized axillary hyperhidrosis has been treated by surgical removal of a substantial portion of axillary skin. Another approach is the use of ''liposuction'' curettage, although how this effectively damages the dermal sweat glands is hard to visualize.''Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) refers to surgical interruption of the sympathetic nerves responsible for sweating. Sympathectomy is an operation intended to destroy part of the nerve supply to the sweat glands in the skin. The surgeon inserts a special endoscopic instrument into the chest between two ribs just below the armpit. The lung is briefly deflated to better visualize and destroy the nerves. Sympathectomy is both effective and risky. Even with newer endoscopic techniques, complications of the procedure can include compensatory, excessive sweating in other parts of the body as well as lung and nerve problems. As many of these complications are serious and not reversible, this option is rarely used, and then only as a last resort.'  "
Is it possible to prevent hyperhidrosis?,"'No, it is not possible to prevent hyperhidrosis.''Most hyperhidrosis patients can be effective and safely treated.' "

What are the signs and symptoms of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'The symptoms of swollen feet and swollen ankles depend on the underlying causes mentioned above.'   In general, swelling caused by dependent edema, pregnancy, medications, and most diseases produce swelling that is bilateral (present in both feet or ankles ) and usually begins as a soft, puffy skin enlargement in the feet that spreads rapidly (often within hours) to the ankles. The skin is easily indented when pressed down with a finger and slowly returns to its more puffy state when the finger pressure is removed. Indentations seen in the puffy skin when shoes or socks are removed are classic signs of swelling. The skin color with this swelling is often normal or slightly pale; indentation marks are slightly darker than the surrounding swollen tissue. Many individuals can simply position themselves on their backs, elevate their feet and ankles higher than their hearts, and after some time (often a few hours), the swelling may resolve completely. However, in some chronic diseases and with some medications taken for long time periods, the swelling becomes chronic and the skin becomes more rigid, reddish and sometimes mildly discolored or mottled and will not return to normal after a few hours of elevation. For example, many people with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) will have chronic bilateral swelling of feet and ankles with skin changes."
What are common causes of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'Swollen ankles and swollen feet have numerous causes. Medically, the word ""swollen"" means protuberant or abnormally distended. Thus, if an ankle or foot is swollen, means it is increased in size. In most common situations, when the word swollen is used in reference to feet and ankles, the user implies the distention or size increase is due to an increase of fluid in the tissues (also termed edema). However, the broad definition includes any factors that increase ankle or foot size (for example increased or excess fluids, increased inflammatory cells or both). Because the majority of factors that cause foot swelling also may cause ankle swelling, this article will discuss swelling as a general topic to cover both foot and ankle swelling. Some of the few exceptions where only foot or ankle swelling occur without both being involved will be discussed. Swollen feet and ankles usually are a symptom or sign of some underlying problem, the majority of which are not a major cause for concern. However, in some instances, foot, ankle, and toes swelling may warn a person that an underlying problem needs immediate medical attention.''The causes of swollen feet and ankles are numerous; examples of the most of the major causes include:''Picture of ''pitting edema'   Dependent swelling (or edema): swelling due to standing or walking (usually over some time period that varies from person to person) Pregnancy: the normal swelling that most pregnant women experience during pregnancy Medications (side effects): Many medications have the side effects of fluid retention that manifests as swelling. Although the reader is advised to check their individual medications for side effects of swelling, general drug categories that may cause swelling include anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids and NSAIDs), hormones, medications for people with diabetes, antidepressants, and many calcium channel blockers (anti-hypertensive and cardiac medications). Injury: Any trauma to the foot or ankle (usually sprains or fractures) can result in swelling. Diseases: heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease (all of these diseases can influence fluid mobilization in the body by physical, metabolic and electrolyte-water interactions) Infection: any infection, either localized (abscess) or diffuse (cellulitis) Lymphedema: swelling due to lymph vessel or lymph node blockage of lymph fluid Blood clot(s): blockage of blood vessels (usually venous) that cause fluid to leak out of vessels into tissue"
Who is at risk for swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'A large number of people are at risk for swollen ankles and feet. Below are listed the causes and those people at risk:' Dependent swelling (or edema): people who are standing or walking for long periods like salespersons, mothers with children, construction workers, obese individuals, and individuals with underlying health problems (see below) Pregnancy: most normal pregnant females, especially in the last trimester. Medications (side effects): people taking anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids and NSAIDs), hormones, medications for people with diabetes, antidepressants, and many calcium channel blockers (anti-hypertensive and cardiac medications). Injury: any person with trauma to the foot or ankle Diseases: Patients with heart disease (especially congestive heart failure), liver disease, kidney disease (all of these diseases can influence fluid mobilization in the body by physical, metabolic and electrolyte-water interactions) Infection: any person infected, either localized (abscess) or diffuse (cellulitis)of the foot or ankle Lymphedema: Persons with lymph vessel or lymph node blockage of lymph fluid, due to infections, trauma or surgical procedures Blood clot(s): People with blockage of blood vessels (usually venous) that cause fluid to leak out of vessels into tissue There are other causes that are less frequent and intermittent (for example, gout or hairline ankle fractures)."
What medical conditions cause symptoms of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'Occasionally, ''specific medical problems'' will show additional or relatively unique symptoms, for example:''Injury or infection'' of the ankle is usually unilateral, but can be bilateral. Injury or infection is often, in the early stages, limited to either the foot or the ankle, but may spread to each other. Swelling due to trauma usually is localized to the injured area (for example, ''ankle sprain'' or ''plantar fasciitis'' in the foot); in some instances, the swollen skin area may be damaged by ''abrasion'', ''laceration'', or ''bruised''. ''Pain'' usually accompanies traumatic foot or ankle injury. Some infections of the foot or ankle may show localized swelling due to abscess formation (tight smooth skin, warm, and sometimes oozing pus) while other infections (cellulitis) show generalized swelling and warm skin, often with redness of the skin. ''Pain'' often is present where infection is located.' Symptoms of gout include swelling of the big toe with redness, warmth and pain, arthritis with swelling and joint pain, or electrolyte imbalance with low magnesium causing foot and leg cramps. Sudden appearance of bilateral feet and ankle swelling during pregnancy (usually after 20 weeks) can be the first symptoms noticed in females with preeclampsia. Unilateral swelling of the foot or ankle usually has the same symptoms described above if the underlying cause is unilateral lymphedema, venous insufficiency or blood clots. However, with blood clots there is often pain generated when the swollen area has pressure applied to the area. Chronic venous insufficiency often has skin changes in color and texture as described above but may also develop skin ulcers or secondary infections."
How do medical professionals diagnose swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"""Clinical observation and examination is the way swollen feet and ankles are diagnosed. A health care professional will likely ask questions about the swelling to obtain specific information and gain insight into the underlying cause of the swelling; once the cause is determined, treatments can be designed to help the patient. Simple observation and a patient's verbal description of the swollen area may be enough to presumptively diagnose the cause. For example:""'Laboratory tests are usually not used to diagnose feet and ankle swelling; however, they may be needed to be ordered in some patients to help diagnose underlying causes of the swelling. ''X-rays'' may be used to determine underlying fractures while ''CTs'' or ''MRI''s may reveal the extent of tissue damage.''Some mild hand and/or foot swelling can resolve without treatment, while other patients can be treated by their primary care doctors. Depending on the underlying cause of the swelling, such specialists as internal medicine, orthopedics, sports medicine, infectious disease, OB/GYN and cardiologists are some examples of specialists that may be consulted.' a swollen ankle that the patient ""twisted"" a day ago is probably due a sprain; a swollen foot that is warm with reddish skin in a person with diabetes, with a small cut on the foot is likely caused by an infection; a bilateral foot and ankle swelling in a cardiac patient who did not take the prescribed diuretics is probably caused by a combination of dependent edema, poor fluid management and decreased cardiac function."
What is the treatment for swollen feet and swollen ankles?,"'The treatment for swollen feet and ankles depends on the underlying cause(s). For many people, simply raising their feet above their ''heart'' or simply getting off their feet regularly during the day will reduce or eliminate the swelling. However, for many other people, treatment of the underlying cause of the swelling may include antibiotics for infections, a splint or wrap for a sprain, taking appropriate medications for ''CHF'' or ''gout''.''Emergent and urgent treatment is infrequent for foot or ankle swelling itself, but does occur for certain underlying causes where feet and ankle swelling or localized swelling is an important symptom and sometimes the major symptom. Examples include''Anytime the swelling is accompanied by other major symptoms such as ''shortness of breath'', ''chest pain'' or ''fever'', a health care professional (emergency department or EMS) should be contacted immediately.'   preeclampsia in pregnancy, heart failure exacerbations, liver failure, kidney failure, foot and ankle fractures, abscesses, cellulitis, and gout exacerbations."
What home remedies help soothe symptoms of swollen ankles or feet?,"""One of the best home remedies for swollen ankles, feet, and toes is to elevate the swollen extremity slightly above the level of the heart. This is easily done by having the person lie down face up on a bed or couch, and then place pillows under the heels so the feet and ankles so they are higher than the person's chest.""'Sitting on a plane seat or on the office chair (or for hours at a time anywhere!) may cause lower extremity swelling. Periodic leg muscle movement by extension and contraction by simply by occasionally walking will help. Some physicians also recommend wearing support hose or compression stockings. Other suggestions are listed in the prevention section below.'  "
What are the complications of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'Swollen feet and ankles can lead to discomfort and pain when walking or ''running'' is attempted. Chronic swelling can lead to skin color changes and skin ulcers. The skin ulcers can occasionally become infected. The skin infections can be further complicated by abscess formation, cellulitis, ''necrotizing fasciitis'', and death.' "
Is it possible to prevent swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'In many situations, the swelling in feet and ankles can be reduced or prevented. The following is a list of ways to reduce or prevent ankle and feet swelling:''Because there are so many underlying causes of feet and ankle swelling, there are numerous ways to avoid or reduce the chances for their development. The reader is urged to follow up on this article by reading about ways to prevent underlying causes of swelling.' Exercise to improve circulation and fluid distribution Eat a healthy diet; too much salt may cause fluid retention, high blood pressure (hypertension), and swelling Interrupt sitting or standing several times a day and elevate the feet and ankles above the heart Lose excess weight to lessen water retention and decrease the build-up of pressure on muscles and joints Consider using support stockings or hose Examine prescription and other medications; consult with the doctor if medication may be responsible for fluid retention Avoid smoking, alcohol and other substances that can lead to underlying causes of swelling"
What is the prognosis for swollen feet and swollen ankles?,"'The majority of people with swollen feet and ankles have a good to excellent outcome because the swelling is usually reversible and has no lasting complications. However, a significant number of patients who have underlying causes that are chronic and refractory to treatment have a wider range of prognosis (good to poor) depending on how well the patient responds to both lifestyle changes and medications.'

What is Felty's syndrome?,"""Felty's syndrome is a complication of long-standing ""'rheumatoid arthritis'"". Felty's syndrome is defined by the presence of three conditions: ""'rheumatoid arthritis'', an enlarged spleen (''splenomegaly'""), and an abnormally low white blood cell count. Felty's syndrome is uncommon. It affects less than 1% of patients with rheumatoid ""'arthritis''.' "
What causes Felty's syndrome?,"""The cause of Felty's syndrome is not known. Some patients with rheumatoid arthritis develop Felty's syndrome, but most do not. White blood cells are produced in the bone marrow. There seems to be an active bone marrow function in patients with Felty's syndrome, producing white cells, despite the low numbers of circulating white blood cells (""'neutropenia'""). White cells may be stored excessively in the spleen of a patient with Felty's syndrome. This is especially true in patients with Felty's syndrome that have antibodies against the particular type of white blood cells usually affected (cells called granulocytes or neutrophils)."" "
What are risk factors for Felty's syndrome?,"""The risk factor for Felty's syndrome is having rheumatoid arthritis."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of Felty's syndrome?,"""Some patients with Felty's syndrome have more infections, such as ""'pneumonia'"" or skin infections, than the average person.

What causes Felty's syndrome?,"""The cause of Felty's syndrome is not known. Some patients with rheumatoid arthritis develop Felty's syndrome, but most do not. White blood cells are produced in the bone marrow. There seems to be an active bone marrow function in patients with Felty's syndrome, producing white cells, despite the low numbers of circulating white blood cells (""'neutropenia'"").

What are barrier methods of birth control (contraception)?,"'Barrier methods of contraception work by creating a physical barrier between sperm and egg cells so that fertilization cannot occur. The most common forms of barrier contraception are:''Spermicides, a form of chemical contraceptive that work by killing sperm, are often combined with barrier methods of contraception for greater effectiveness.''Barrier methods of contraception generally do not have the side effects of hormonal contraceptives, and some forms of barrier contraception (contraceptive sponges and condoms) may be obtained without a prescription and easily purchased over the counter at pharmacies.''The only medical contraindication to the use of barrier contraception is ''latex allergy'' (when using latex condoms). However, with the exception of male and female condoms that can provide some protection against infection with sexually-transmitted diseases (''STDs''), most methods of barrier contraception are not effective in preventing STDs.'  condoms (male and female), diaphragm, cervical cap, and contraceptive sponge."
Spermicides,"""During sexual intercourse, hundreds of millions of sperm are normally released into a woman's vagina. The large majority of these sperm die. They die because of the vagina's unfriendly environment, which is acidic, and because the ""'mucus'"" in the cervix above the vagina acts as a selective filter for the sperm. Only about 1% of all the sperm released in an ejaculation successfully pass through the woman's vagina and cervix to reach the uterus (the womb). However, it only takes one sperm to fertilize the ovum (the egg) and to achieve ""'conception''.''Spermicides are a type of contraceptive agent that work by killing sperm.'""Spermicides need to be placed in a woman's vagina prior to intercourse if they are to prevent viable sperm from reaching her uterus. Spermicides come in a wide variety of forms, including jellies, creams, foams, films, and suppositories. The active ingredient in essentially all spermicides is Nonoxynol-9. This is a detergent-like chemical that kills sperm (i.e. spermicidal).""'Once placed inside the vagina, the spermicide melts into a liquid that coats the vagina in order to provide a chemical barrier between the sperm and the cervix. Spermicidal foams are more effective than creams or jellies. Not only is it possible to achieve a better distribution with foam, but foam adheres better to the vaginal walls and cervix.''Suppositories are solid or semi-solid inserts which must be inserted in the vagina 15 minutes before intercourse in order to bind with vaginal moisture and liquefy.''Vaginal contraceptive film needs to be in place in the vagina about 5 minutes prior to sexual intercourse in order to liquefy and become effective.'""Spermicides resemble other methods of birth control in that they must be used properly in order to prevent pregnancy. Each type of spermicide has a unique method of use. For example, spermicidal creams, gels, and foams need to be deposited high up in the vagina near the cervix. Spermicidal suppositories must be unwrapped and inserted in the vagina. Squares of spermicidal film should be inserted into the vagina with the user's finger. It is important to follow the package's exact instructions.""""A spermicide should be placed in the vagina prior to the man's penis entering the vagina. It is a common mistake for a couple to wait too long before using the spermicide.""'There are two basic concerns with any given spermicide. 1) How long the spermicide stays in the desired place; and 2) how long the spermicide is active in killing sperm. Therefore, the timing of spermicide use must take into account both of these factors.''In general, spermicides tend to be effective soon after their application. They can be inserted 15 minutes or more before intercourse. However, if there is a significant delay before intercourse (for example an hour), more spermicide must be added.''A fresh application of spermicide must also be used for each act of intercourse.''Douching'' should be avoided for at least 8 hours after the last intercourse.''The effectiveness of spermicides in preventing pregnancy varies from 70 to 90%. This depends on the amount of spermicide and how it is used, the timing of use prior to intercourse, and how well the instructions on the package are followed.''Spermicides should not be used as protection for the woman or man against sexually transmitted infections (sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs). While spermicides may be partially protective against certain organisms that cause sexually transmitted infections, (e.g. ''Chlamydia'' and ''gonorrhea''), they also do not protect against the ''human Immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV'') infection.''The main objection voiced concerning spermicides is that they are ""messy."" A small percent (2% to 4%) of people may have an adverse reaction to Nonoxynol-9, which is experienced as an irritation or a burning sensation within the vagina or on the external genitalia.''Spermicides have some positive features. They are relatively inexpensive and they are available over-the- counter (OTC) without a prescription.''Note that some lubricating jellies available ''over-the-counter'' do not contain spermicide and are not meant to be used as a form of birth control. It is important to check the information on the package to be sure that the product contains spermicide or that the word ""contraceptive"" appears on the label.' "
Male condom,"'Male condoms are far more common than female condoms. A ''male condom'"" is a thin sheath that is worn over the man's penis during sexual intercourse. The ""'condom'' collects sperm so that it is not released into the vagina. Condoms are known as rubbers, sheaths, prophylactics, and many other names.''Condoms are made from a variety of materials including latex, rubber, ''plastic'' polyurethane, and animal tissue. They are also available in a variety of sizes, colors, styles, and thicknesses. They may be dry, lubricated, or treated with a spermicide. Although convenient, a wallet is not the best place to store condoms. Condoms last longer when they are stored under less moist conditions. In general, condoms have a shelf life of about five years if stored unopened in a cool, dry place.'""A condom must be the correct size and fit the man's erect penis properly. There should be 1/2 inch (about 1.25 cm) at the tip of the condom to provide a space for the sperm-filled semen to collect. Some condoms have this feature built in.""'Prior to any contact between the penis and the vagina, the condom is unrolled over the erect penis, ensuring the condom is not turned backwards or inside out. Some condoms come pre-lubricated. If additional lubrication is desired, a water-based product should be used. Spermicides may be used as lubricants with condoms and may thus increase the efficacy of the condom. Oil-based products such as Vaseline, vaginal creams, or mineral oil, may damage the condom and should never be used.''There is an obvious problem of lack of barrier protection if the condom breaks, slips, or comes off the penis. Condoms are quality controlled in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for manufacturing defects that could result in breakage. Condom failure can also be caused by the user and/or his partner. For example, long fingernails or jewelry can tear condoms.''Immediately after ejaculation, the condom should be removed from the vagina. It should be held firmly in place at the base of his penis, as it is withdrawn from the vagina. Care must be taken not to spill any of the ejaculate from the condom.''Each condom must be discarded after a single use. A new condom must be used for the next act of intercourse. Male condoms are not reusable.''Condoms can be purchased over-the-counter (OTC) without a prescription. Most of those on the market are made of latex. The estimated effectiveness of the latex condom is 87% to 90% or 10 to 13 ''pregnancies''/100 women per year of sexual activity.''About 1% to 3% of people are ''allergic'' to latex. In such cases, they may be able to use condoms made of polyurethane, a type of plastic, can often be used. However, polyurethane condoms may break more easily than latex condoms and they do not protect against sexually transmitted infections (sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs).''Latex condoms afford the maximum protection against sexually transmitted infections including ''HIV'' (human immunodeficiency virus) and ''herpes'' virus. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), consistent and correct usage of latex condoms:''Animal membrane condoms, made from the ''intestines'' of sheep, when used with contraceptive foam, can be effective in preventing pregnancy, but they may not provide adequate protection against all sexually transmitted infections. This is because the pores in the animal tissue permit small organisms such as ''viruses'' to pass through.''The most frequent complaint lodged regarding condoms is that their usage decreases sexual pleasure for the male. This is an unfortunate attitude because male condoms are an effective, acceptable, inexpensive, and safe method of birth control.' is highly effective in preventing sexual transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. reduces the risk for many STDs that are transmitted by genital fluids (STDs such as Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis). reduces the risk for genital ulcer diseases, such as genital herpes, syphilis, and chancroid, only when the infected area or site of potential exposure is protected. may reduce the risk for genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-associated diseases (for example, genital warts and cervical cancer)."
Female condom,"""The female condom is not well known in the United States. It is essentially a cylindrical vaginal pouch made of soft polyurethane (a type of plastic) with a ring at either end. One end of the pouch is open. The other end is closed. A woman inserts the closed end high up in her vagina over her cervix. The open end remains on the outside of her vagina. The vagina is now lined with the condom. When she has intercourse, the man inserts his penis into the open end of the woman's condom. Once intercourse is over and the man withdraws his penis, the condom containing the semen can now be removed and discarded.""'The female condom can be put in up to 8 hours before intercourse. A significant amount of practice may be necessary before a woman can properly insert and position a female condom. The sides of the internal ring can be folded together and inserted into the vagina much like a diaphragm is inserted. The female condom is thinner than the male condom and is resistant to degradation by oil-based lubricants.''A female condom should never be used when the man is also wearing a condom. The two condoms can stick together and tear, resulting in a total loss of protection.''The female condom (Reality) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1993. The Reality Condom is made of polyurethane, but other types of female condoms are available in other areas of the world. Its estimated effectiveness is 85% (15 pregnancies/100 women per year) as compared to 87% to 90% for the male condom.''Problems associated with the female condom include irritation and allergic reactions to the polyurethane. Other concerns are that the female condom is cumbersome, difficult to insert, may not remain in place, and is unattractive. It may also produce unpleasant noises if there is not enough lubrication. For this reason, most female condoms are now generously pre-lubricated with silicone and packets of additional lubricant are included. The lubricant does not contain spermicide.''The female condom (Reality) can be purchased over-the counter (OTC) without a prescription, but it may cost more than a male condom. Package instructions currently advise single use but studies are underway to determine if the female condom can be safely washed and reused up to five times.''The main disadvantage of the female condom is that it is not as effective as its male latex counterpart.''The main disadvantage of the female condom is that it is not as effective as the male latex condom in preventing pregnancy.' "
Contraceptive sponge,"'The contraceptive sponge is a doughnut-shaped ring of polyurethane foam and is impregnated with the spermicide Nonoxynol-9. This chemical confers most of the contraceptive efficacy of this product.''Before intercourse, a woman inserts the sponge high into the vagina in the manner similar to the insertion of a tampon. The spermicidal sponge should then act as a barrier in order to prevent sperm from reaching the cervix. Once in place, the sponge provides protection for up to 24 hours without the need for additional spermicide.''The sponge must remain in the vagina for at least 6 hours following intercourse in order to provide optimum contraception. However, the same sponge should never remain in the vagina for more than a total of 30 hours because of the risk of ''toxic shock syndrome''. (''Toxic shock syndrome'' is an uncommon and potentially very serious illness that is caused by a type of bacteria. This illness occurs when certain types of products, such as tampons,are left in place for excessive periods of time. Package inserts for these products are careful to specify how long they may be safely kept in place. Each sponge is discarded after a single use.''The sponge is generally an effective birth control. Some users of the contraceptive sponge may experience irritation and allergic reactions. The sponge can also be difficult to remove from the vagina. Removal has been made easier by the addition of a woven polyester loop which can be more easily grasped with the fingers.''The estimated contraceptive efficacy of the sponge is estimated to be between 64% and 82%. The spermicide may provide some protection against ''Chlamydia'' and gonorrhea, but otherwise, the degree of this protection is unknown.' "
Diaphragm,"'The diaphragm is a soft, flexible, dome-shaped latex cup which is inserted into the vagina prior to intercourse. The rim of the cup contains a coil spring of metal which serves to hold it in place. The diaphragm blocks access to the cervix so that sperm cannot pass from the vagina into the uterus. The diaphragm must be covered on both sides and especially around its rim with spermicidal jelly, cream, or foam in order to form a tight seal with the vaginal walls.''A woman should insert the diaphragm into her vagina no more than 4 hours prior to intercourse. Following ''coitus'', she should check the diaphragm should be checked to ensure that it was not mechanically dislodged. The diaphragm must be left in place for at least 6-8 hours following intercourse, at which time it should be removed. Additional spermicidal jelly or foam must be inserted into the vagina each act of intercourse.''Since diaphragms are only available with a prescription, a woman must see a health care practitioner to have a diaphragm properly fitted (they come in a range of sizes), and to learn proper insertion techniques. There are no known long-term health risks associated with using the diaphragm and spermicide method of birth control. Some women may find spermicides to be irritating, but changing brands of spermicides may help. There is also an increased risk of ''urinary tract infections'' with diaphragm use. One possible reason is that the diaphragm puts increased pressure on the urethra or the spermicide may contribute to irritation leading to infection. (The cervical cap is not associated with increases in ''urinary tract infections''.)''The diaphragm may be appealing to women because it offers a safe temporary (not permanent) birth control that is under her control.''When the diaphragm and spermicide are used correctly, they are thought to have over an 82% success rate (18 pregnancies/100 women per year). To ensure protection, it is important to check the diaphragm after every use for rips or holes after each usage. This is best accomplished by filling the diaphragm with water and then holding it up to the light to observe for leakage. Also, the fit of the diaphragm should be checked annually, following pregnancy, and after significant ''weight loss''.''Using a diaphragm does not confer protection against sexually transmitted infections, although the spermicide does give partial protection against gonorrhea and Chlamydia. It can, however, be used with condoms in order to confer some protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).' "
Cervical cap,"'The cervical cap is a small (1-1/2 inches or about 3 cm.), thimble-shaped dome made of latex or silicone rubber (it is much smaller than a diaphragm) which fits directly over the cervix. The cervical cap is used in conjunction with a spermicide. One small application of spermicide is placed inside the cap at the time of insertion. The cap plus spermicide prevent sperm from going through the cervix and entering the uterus.''The cervical cap is gently inserted into the vagina and positioned over her cervix. It can be inserted as long as 8 hours prior to intercourse, and can be allowed to remain in place for up to 48 hours. Unlike the diaphragm, fresh spermicidal jelly or foam does not need to be added with each act of intercourse as long as the cervical cap is correctly positioned over the cervix.''As with the diaphragm, a cervical cap requires a prescription. A woman must see a health care practitioner to determine the correct size and to ensure that she understands the proper insertion and removal techniques.''There are no known significant health risks associated with using the cervical cap and spermicide. The cervical cap can be difficult to insert, but it may be helpful for women who are unable to use a diaphragm because of poor muscle tone. Women who suffer from recurring urinary tract infections related to diaphragm usage may also want to elect to try the cervical cap.''It is important to remember that using a cervical cap does not protect from sexually transmitted infections, although spermicides may give some protection against Chlamydia and gonorrhea.''When the cervical cap and spermicide are used properly, they are more than 80% effective in achieving reliable contraception.'

Female reproductive system definition,'The female reproductive system is made up of internal organs and external structures. Its function is to enable reproduction of the species. Sexual maturation is the process that this system undergoes in order to carry out its role in the process of ''pregnancy'' and birth.' 
What do the reproductive organs look like (picture)?,"'The uterus, or womb, is a hollow organ located centrally in the pelvis. It houses the developing fetus during pregnancy. The lower portion of the uterus is called the cervix and opens into the vagina, or birth canal. An opening in the cervix allows for the passage of sperm into the uterus and the exit of menstrual blood. This same opening dilates during ''labor'' to allow passage of the baby through the birth canal. Arising from the upper portion of the uterus on each side are the Fallopian tubes. These are channels that allow eggs from the ovaries to enter the uterus. The process of ''fertilization'"" of an egg by a sperm cell typically happens in the Fallopian tubes, and the fertilized egg moves into the uterus where it is implanted. Beside the uterus on each side and near the opening of the Fallopian tubes are the small, oval ovaries. They produce hormones and contain eggs. At birth, a female has 1 to 2 million eggs already present in the ovaries, but only about 300 of them will mature during a woman's lifetime."" "
External reproductive organs,"'The labia majora are two fleshy protrusions that protect and envelop the other external reproductive organs. They are covered with hair after ''puberty''.\xa0They contain glands that produce sweat and oils. Inside the labia majora are the labia minora, smaller protrusions of flesh that surround the openings to the urethra (that allows passage or urine) and the vagina. Located next to the vaginal opening are glands that produce ''mucus'"" known as Bartholin's glands. At the junction of the labia minora is the clitoris, a small structure that is covered by a skin fold called the prepuce. The clitoris is comparable to the male penis and is highly sensitive."" "
The menstrual cycle,"'The ''menstrual cycle'' is the monthly cycle of follicle and egg maturation, release of an egg (''ovulation''), and preparation of the uterine lining for pregnancy. If a woman does not become ''pregnant'', the uterine lining tissue is shed as menstrual blood. Most menstrual cycles occur every 28 days. Menarche is the time during adolescence when menstrual periods begin. Menstrual periods continue to occur until a woman reaches ''menopause''.' "
Follicular phase,"'The follicular phase is the beginning of the menstrual cycle. It starts on the first day of menstrual bleeding and usually lasts about 14 days. The hormones ''follicle-stimulating hormone'' (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are released from the ''pituitary gland'' to stimulate the ovaries. In turn, the ovaries produce estrogen and stimulate the maturation of about 15 to 20 eggs in the ovaries inside small cystic areas known as follicles. Once estrogen levels begin to rise, the secretion of FSH is reduced by a feedback system so that follicle stimulation ceases at the appropriate time. With time, one of the egg follicles (or rarely, two or more) becomes dominant, and maturation of the other follicles is interrupted. The dominant follicle continues to make estrogen.' "
Ovulation,"'Ovulation occurs at the midpoint of the menstrual cycle. Estrogen production from the dominant follicle leads to a sharp rise in LH secretion, causing the dominant follicle to release its egg. The egg is swept into the Fallopian tube by thin structures on the ends of the tubes known as fimbriae. At this time, the cervix produces an increased amount of thin mucus that assists sperm in the passage into the uterus.' "
Luteal phase,"'The luteal phase of the menstrual cycle begins at ovulation (egg release). After the egg is released, the empty follicle turns into a cystic mass of cells called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum then produces ''progesterone'', a hormone that readies the lining of the uterus for implantation of a fertilized egg. If an egg has been fertilized, the fertilized egg travels down one of the Fallopian tubes into the uterus and implants in the uterine lining tissue. If fertilization of an egg has not occurred, the lining of the uterus eventually breaks down and is shed resulting in menstrual bleeding.' "
Menopause,"'Menopause'' is defined at the point in time at which a woman has not had a ''menstrual period'"" for 12 consecutive months. It signals the end of a woman's ""'fertility'' and occurs, on average, at 51 years of age, though the time of ''menopause'' can vary widely.

What is ferritin?,'Ferritin is the major iron storage protein of the body. Ferritin levels can be used to indirectly measure how much iron is in the body. Ferritin has the shape of a hollow sphere that permits the entry of a variable amount of iron for storage (as ferric hydroxide phosphate complexes).' 
What is the ferritin blood test?,"""The ferritin test uses venous blood to measure ferritin levels. The test is sometimes ordered together with other tests to help evaluate the body's iron stores, such as an iron level or a total iron binding capacity (TIBC) test."" "
How does one prepare for a ferritin blood test?,'The ferritin test uses venous blood that is withdrawn as for any routine blood test. No special preparation for the test is necessary. Fasting is not necessary.' 
How is the test performed?,"'A needle attached to a vacuum collection device is inserted into a vein, often a vein in the antecubital fossa (crease of the elbow), after the area has been cleaned. Venous blood can also be taken from other sites.' "
What are the potential side effects of a ferritin blood test?,'The ferritin blood test is a routine blood test and typically does not cause side effects. Mild ''bruising'' at the venipuncture site can occur infrequently.' 
What are normal results for a ferritin test?,"'The results may vary slightly among laboratories, but in general, normal ferritin levels range from 12 to 300 nanograms per milliliter of blood (ng/mL) for males and 12 to 150 ng/mL for females.' "
What does an elevated ferritin level mean?,"'Higher-than-normal levels of ferritin can be indicative of an iron storage disorder such as ''hemochromatosis''.''Hereditary ''hemochromatosis'' is an ''inherited'' (genetic) disorder in which there is excessive accumulation of iron in the body (''iron overload''). In individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, the daily absorption of iron from the ''intestines'' is greater than the amount needed to replace losses. Since the normal body cannot increase iron excretion, the absorbed iron accumulates in the body.''People with hereditary hemochromatosis may have no symptoms or signs (and have normal longevity), or they can have severe symptoms and signs of ''iron overload'' that include:''The symptoms arise because iron accumulates in the organs and leads to destruction and loss of normal function.''Other causes of a high ferritin level are chronic inflammatory medical conditions such as ''liver disease'' or ''rheumatoid arthritis'', or some types of ''cancer''.'   A man with hemochromatosis can accumulate 20 grams of total body iron by age 40 to 50 (the normal iron content for the body is 3 to 4 grams). The excess iron deposits in the joints, liver, testicles, and heart, which causes damage to these organs, and causes signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis. Women with hemochromatosis accumulate iron at a slower rate than men because they lose more iron than men due to iron loss from menstruation. Therefore, they typically develop signs and symptoms of organ damage due to excess iron 10 years later than men. sexual dysfunction, heart failure, joint pains, liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, weight loss, fatigue, and darkening of skin."
What does a low ferritin level mean?,"'Lower-than-normal serum ferritin levels are seen in ''iron deficiency''. Without enough iron, the body cannot produce sufficient levels of ''hemoglobin'', a component of ''red blood cells'' that allows them to carry oxygen. ''Iron deficiency anemia'' is the result. Mild ''anemia'' may not produce symptoms at all. More serious cases of ''iron deficiency anemia'' can produce symptoms such as:' shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, feeling lightheaded, pale skin, and fast heartbeat."
What is fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'In 1996, the Institute of Medicine defined fetal alcohol syndrome as ""a pattern of physical, behavioral and cognitive abnormalities in individuals exposed to alcohol while in the womb. The association between these findings and maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy is well documented. To establish the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome, specific criteria must be met. These include (1) documentation of three characteristic facial abnormalities, (2) documentation of smaller than expected ''prenatal'' and/or postnatal length, weight, and head circumference growth parameters, and (3) documentation of central nervous system abnormalities including measurable reduction in brain growth and function and behavioral/academic abnormalities, (4) other ''congenital malformations'' of the ''heart'', kidneys, eyes, and ''hearing loss''. These criteria will be further described later in this article.' "
What causes fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'Alcohol is rapidly transported via placental blood flow from mother to fetus and is known to cause ''miscarriage'' and birth defects. Within two hours of maternal ingestion, fetal alcohol blood levels are similar to maternal alcohol blood levels. There is no established relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and side effects sustained by the infant. This puzzling observation may reflect the maternal rate of alcohol breakdown via her ''liver''.''It has been observed that alcohol consumed at any time during pregnancy may be associated with severe and permanent consequences. First trimester pregnancy alcohol ingestion is linked to the characteristic facial abnormalities of FAS as well as a reduction of intrauterine growth rate. Alcohol consumption during the ''second trimester'' also contributes to lower IQ, growth retardation in length and birth weight, as well as cognitive deficits of reading, spelling, and math. ''Third trimester'' alcohol consumption amplifies retardation in birth length and ultimate adult height potential.' "
What are risk factors for fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'The Surgeon General and the Secretary for Health and Human Services recommend total abstinence from alcohol for women planning pregnancy, at the time of ''conception'' and throughout the entire pregnancy. No safe level of prenatal alcohol consumption has been documented. Multiple other countries have established similar guidelines.''Other risk factors include the following:' Binge drinking (four or more drinks in one sitting) is more problematic than consumption of the same amount of alcohol spread out over time (such as four back-to-back drinks at one sitting vs. one drink per day for four days). Older maternal age (over 35 years old) African-American or Native-American ethnic groups and a listing of many varied background elements (lower socioeconomic status, smoking, unmarried, unemployed, use of illicit drugs, maternal history of sexual or physical abuse, history of incarceration, having a partner or family member who drinks heavily and experiencing psychological stress or having a mental health disorder)"
What are symptoms and signs of fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'Infants with the diagnostic criteria to establish fetal alcohol syndrome exhibit the following characteristic findings:'  Unique facial characteristics: a thin upper lip; a uniquely smooth ridge between the upper lip and nose (the ""philtrum""); and a smaller than normal space between the upper and lower eyelids (""palpebral fissure"") Growth delay: smaller than expected length, weight, and head circumference measurements during both intrauterine and post-birth growth Central nervous system abnormalities: (a) structural (small brain size and slower than expected growth); (b) functional (global developmental delay in motor skills, language acquisition and utilization, problems with attention/hyperactivity, social skill deficiencies, impaired memory and judgment, and poor impulse control, etc.) Children with fetal alcohol syndrome commonly have birth defects that include heart defects, as well as abnormalities of the kidneys, eyes, and hearing loss."
How do physicians diagnose fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'The risk for potential fetal alcohol syndrome is established during the first prenatal visit. Pregnant women are questioned regarding behavioral risk factors, including illicit drug usage, alcohol consumption, ''smoking'', and other high-risk behaviors. Several screening questionnaires may be utilized; these include (1) T-ACE, (2) TWEAK, and (3) AUDIT-C. There are several laboratory blood studies that may indicate recent use or repeated and excessive ''alcohol abuse''.''Prenatal indicators for potential alcohol use would note smaller than expected growth in length, weight, and head measurements. Slower than expected head growth is a reflection of subnormal brain growth. Once born, the above-noted facial changes will lead the pediatrician to consideration of the diagnosis of FAS. The myriad of developmental and cognitive delays discussed above will also stimulate consideration of FAS in children who are failing in cognitive advancement or with associated behavioral deficiencies.' "
"Are there other alcohol-related fetal abnormality patterns less severe than 
fetal alcohol syndrome?","'In addition to fetal alcohol syndrome, there are three other conditions associated with fetal exposure to alcohol. These include the following:' Requirements for partial FAS with confirmed maternal alcohol exposure: confirmed fetal alcohol exposure; characteristic facial abnormalities; either growth retardation, brain neurodevelopmental findings, other unexplained behavioral abnormalities and alcohol-related birth defects Requirements for alcohol-related birth defects: confirmed maternal alcohol exposure, birth defects and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders Requirements for alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder: confirmed maternal alcohol exposure and either neurodevelopmental abnormalities or other unexplained behavioral abnormalities"
What is the treatment for fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'While no cure exists for fetal alcohol syndrome, early intervention programs have been shown to lessen the impact of language, motor, and cognitive impairments. Such aggressive programs utilize physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and educational therapy to maximize benefit. Adolescents and adults may benefit from programs dealing with academic, legal, and psychiatric problems.' "
What are the complications and long-term effects of fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'Many of the issues faced by infants and children with FAS continue into adolescence and adulthood. These may include:''More unique to adolescents and adults are issues with sexual behavior, legal problems, and ''substance abuse''. It is often observed that the characteristic facial features noted in infancy and childhood seem to ""soften"" with age. A small-sized head and ''short stature'' do continue into adulthood.' problems with ""regulation"" (sleeping, attention, and arousal), learning disorders, impairment with vision and hearing, mental retardation, deficits in memory, reasoning, and judgment."
What is the prognosis of fetal alcohol syndrome?,"'As noted in the above discussion, an individual with FAS may experience a lifelong litany of both physical and intellectual challenges. Early intervention programs and multi-therapy programs (including physical therapy) may often lessen the impact of the diagnosis.' "
Is it possible to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome?,'Yes! Avoid all alcohol consumption while planning for conception and during pregnancy.' 
Is it safe to consume alcohol and breastfeed?,"'The concentration of alcohol in ''breast milk'' is very similar to maternal blood levels. Potential consequences include a reduction in breast milk consumption, alteration of ''newborn'' ''sleep'' and wake cycles, and possible delay of motor development at 1 year of age.' "

Fetal movement introduction,'One of the most exciting moments in your ''pregnancy'' is when you feel those first little flutters of your baby kicking. These tiny movements reassure you that your baby is developing and help you feel closer to the little life inside of you.' 
When Will I Feel My Baby Kicking?,"'You should feel your baby\'s first movements, called ""quickening,"" between weeks 16 and 25 of your ''pregnancy'"". If this is your first pregnancy, you may not feel your baby move until closer to 25 weeks. By the second pregnancy, some women start to feel movements as early as 13 weeks. You're more likely to feel baby move when you're in a quiet position, either sitting or lying down.""  "
What Does the Baby Kicking Feel Like?,"'''Pregnant'"" women describe their baby's movements as butterflies, nervous twitches, or a tumbling motion. At first, it may be hard to tell whether your baby has moved. Second- and third-time moms are more adept at distinguishing those first baby movements from ""'gas'' , hunger pangs, and other internal motions. ''By your second and third ''trimesters'"", the movements should be more distinct, and you'll be able to feel your baby's kicks, jabs, and elbows. ""  "
How Often Should I Feel My Baby Moving?,"'Early in your pregnancy, you may just feel a few flutters every now and then. But as your baby grows -- usually by the end of the ''second trimester'' -- the kicks should grow stronger and more frequent. Studies show that by the ''third trimester'', the baby moves about 30 times each hour.''''Babies'' tend to move more at certain times of the day as they alternate between alertness and ''sleep'"". They are usually most active between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m., right as you're trying to get to ""'sleep''. This surge in activity is due to your changing ''blood sugar'' levels. ''Babies'' also can respond to sounds or touch, and may even kick your partner in the back if you snuggle too close in bed.' "
Should I Monitor My Baby's Kicking?,"""Once your baby's movements are well established (usually by week 28), some doctors recommend keeping track of all those little punches, jabs, and kicks to make sure your baby is still developing normally. There isn't any real scientific evidence to prove whether this method is a good indicator of the baby's well-being, so check with your health care provider to see what he or she recommends.""""If you are counting, it helps to chart your baby's kicks so that you can keep track of your baby's normal patterns of movement. To count movements, pick a time when your baby is usually most active (often, this is right after you've eaten a meal). Get into a comfortable position either sitting down in a comfortable chair or lying on your side.""""Opinion varies as to how to count your baby's movements, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends noting the time it takes for your baby to make 10 movements. You should feel at least 10 movements within a two-hour period.""""If you don't feel your baby move 10 times by the end of two hours, try again later in the day. Then if you still can't feel 10 movements in two hours, or your baby is much less active than normal, call your health care provider, who can check your baby's ""'heart'' rate and movements.' "
If You Don't Feel Your Baby Moving?,"""If you haven't yet reached 25 weeks and don't feel your baby move, or you're not sure that what you're feeling is actually your baby, don't panic. As your baby grows, you'll be able to better distinguish his or her movements. You'll also figure out at what times of the day your baby is most active. Some babies just naturally move less often than others.""'A lack of movement also may mean that your baby is asleep. You may feel fewer kicks and jabs after the 32nd week as your baby gets bigger and has less room to move around in the uterus.'""If your baby has started to move regularly and you don't feel at least 10 movements within a two-hour period, or the movements have slowed significantly, it's time to call your doctor.""

Embryo vs. fetus week by week,"  The terms embryo and fetus both refer to the developing baby inside the mother’s womb (uterus). The distinction between embryo and fetus is made based on gestational age. An embryo is the early stage of human development in which organs are critical body structures are formed. An embryo is termed a fetus beginning in the 11th week of pregnancy, which is the 9th week of development after fertilization of the egg. A zygote is a single-celled organism resulting from a fertilized egg. The zygote divides to become a ball of cells that eventually implants in the wall of the uterus. This ball of cells, known as a blastocyst, develops into the embryo and placenta. Doctors date pregnancy from the first day of the last menstrual period."
What is an embryo?,"'Doctors define pregnancy according to the date of a woman’s last ''menstrual period''.' The first two weeks of pregnancy are counted as the time prior to ovulation, in which the body is preparing to release an egg. Week #3 begins with release of an egg, or ovulation. If the egg is fertilized by a sperm cell, it is known as a zygote. The zygote divides and becomes a collection of cells known as a blastocyst. In week #4 of pregnancy, the blastocyst implants in the wall of the uterus and develops into the placenta and embryo. The blastocyst is considered an embryo at the point when the amniotic sac develops (by about day 10 to 12 after fertilization, or at the start of week #5 of pregnancy). An embryo represents the early stage of human development, roughly corresponding to the 5th-10th weeks of pregnancy."
What is a fetus?,"'After the embryonic period has ended at the end of the 10th week of pregnancy, the embryo is now considered a fetus. A fetus is a developing baby beginning in the 11th week of pregnancy.' "
The developing embryo: Week #4 to Week #11,"'The embryonic period of development is the stage in which most organs are formed. Organs begin to form, and the embryo elongates and starts to assume a human-like shape. The ''heart'' and main blood vessels are formed, and the heart starts beating by the 6th week. The primitive brain and spinal cord (neural tube) also begin to form.''By 12 weeks of pregnancy almost all of the baby’s organs are formed, including the arms and legs. The brain and spinal cord, however, continue to develop throughout pregnancy. The baby is about 2 inches long at the end of the embryonic period.''Most ''birth defects'' occur during the embryonic period, the critical time when organs are forming. The embryonic period is the time of greatest susceptibility to the negative effects of ''drugs'', ''radiation'', and viral infections.' "
Fetal period: week #12 to week #40,"'The fetal period is a time of growth of the developing baby. The organs and structures formed in the embryonic period continue to grow and develop.''The ''second trimester'' begins in the 13th week. By about 14 weeks of pregnancy, the gender of the fetus can be identified. Women can begin to feel movement of the fetus somewhere between the 16th and 20th weeks of pregnancy. The baby grows to about 2 pounds during the ''second trimester''.''In the ''third trimester'', starting in the 27th week, the baby assumes the size and characteristics of a ''newborn'' and prepares for birth. The fetus will open its eyes and breathe in the ''amniotic fluid''.' "
Your first prenatal visit with your doctor or midwife,"'You should set up an appointment with your doctor or ''midwife'' as soon as you have a positive ''pregnancy test'' result. At the initial visit, your doctor or midwife will'  Discuss your medical history and any effect this may have on your pregnancy. Estimate your due date. Perform a physical examination. Order lab work to look for any infections and to determine your blood type, immunity against certain infections, and your red blood cell count Discuss any medications you are taking, and whether you will need to alter these during pregnancy and discuss the need for vitamins or supplements during pregnancy Discuss expected weight gain, activity level, and nutrition for a healthy pregnancy Provide contact information to call in case you have any questions, or are worried that something is wrong Answer any questions you may have Set up your next appointment and discuss how often you should visit your doctor or midwife."
Which stage has the most risk of miscarriage?,"'The greatest risks of ''miscarriage'' are in the very early ''stages of pregnancy''. An estimated 25% or more of ''pregnancies'' end in the very early stages, many before a woman even knows that she is ''pregnant'' or has missed a ''menstrual period''. Most other miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy when the embryo is developing.' "
What is a fever? What is a headache?,"'A ''fever'' is an elevated body temperature due to any cause. ''Fevers'"" occur as a result of the body's own defenses against disease. Although a ""'fever'' technically is any body temperature above the normal of 98.6 F (37 C), medical professionals usually do not consider a person to have a significant fever until the temperature is above 100.4 F (38 C).''A ''headache'' is any type of ''pain'' felt in the head. Many causes of ''headache'' can be associated with fever.''This article is not all-inclusive and is an introduction to fever and ''headache'' problems. If you are not sure if your condition is mild, contact your medical ''caregiver''. If you think you or a loved one has serious symptoms, go to an emergency department.' "
What are causes and risk factors for a fever with a headache?,"'There are a number of conditions that can cause both fever and ''headache''. Examples of conditions that can cause fever along with a headache include the following:' Influenza (flu) Colds, although the fever is generally mild and may not be present Meningitis Encephalitis Ear infection Bacterial infection, including sepsis, pneumonia, and others Fungal infections Heat stroke Chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis Certain cancers Rocky Mountain spotted fever"
What signs and symptoms may accompany a fever with a headache?,"'The signs and symptoms that accompany a fever with headache depend on the exact cause and are thus very variable. These can include the following:' Nausea and vomiting Joint pain and swelling Ear, eye, or facial pain Rash Low blood pressure Cough, nasal congestion, sneezing, or sore throat Cold, clammy skin Sweating Stiffness of the neck Sensitivity to light Vision changes Decreased appetite Mental status changes like confusion Seizure Coma"
When should you see a doctor for a fever with a headache?,"'You should seek medical attention if any of these conditions exists:' The temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or greater. Fever lasts more than seven days Fever symptoms get worse Confusion or excessive sleepiness Stiff neck Severe headache Rash with fever and headache Chest pain Trouble breathing Red, hot, or swollen area of skin Any unusual symptom that causes concern"
What are medications and treatments for a fever with a headache?,"'Treatments for fever with headache depend on the cause.'  Bacterial or fungal infections require treatment with antibiotics or antifungal drugs. Antiviral drugs may treat influenza and other viral infections. Medical professionals may administer supportive medications, such as pain control drugs, decongestants, cough suppressants, and medications to control nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, hospitalization and treatments to support breathing and circulation may be required."
Is it possible to prevent fevers and headaches?,"'It is not possible to prevent all causes of fever and headache, although you can take measures to help avoid infectious diseases and some other causes of headache and fever.' Always use good hand-washing hygiene. Do not share eating utensils, drinking glasses, toothbrushes, or towels with others. Avoid contact with ill people. Take appropriate precautions against mosquito and tick bites when outdoors. Stay hydrated in the sun or heat."
What is the prognosis for a fever with a headache?,"'The prognosis for fever with headache is highly variable. Some conditions that cause these symptoms have an excellent prognosis. For example, most people recover fully from colds and the flu without significant long-term complications. On the other hand, serious causes of fever and headache (such as ''encephalitis'' or meningitis) may be fatal especially if not properly treated.' "
What are fibrocystic breasts?,"'Fibrocystic breasts are characterized by lumpiness and usually discomfort in one or both breasts. The lumpiness is due to small breast masses or breast ''cysts''. The condition is very common and benign, meaning that fibrocystic breasts are ''not'' ''malignant'' (cancerous). Fibrocystic breast disease (FBD) is now referred to as fibrocystic changes or fibrocystic breast condition, is the most common cause of ""lumpy breasts"" and affects more than 60% of women. The condition primarily affects women between the ages of 30 and 50, and tends to resolve after ''menopause''.''The diagnosis of fibrocystic breasts is complicated by the fact that the condition can vary widely in its severity.'  "
"What are the symptoms of lumps, cysts, or fibrosis of the breasts?","'In some women, the symptoms of fibrocystic breast condition can be very mild with minimal breast tenderness or ''pain''. The symptoms can also be limited in time, usually occurring only premenstrually. It may not even be possible to feel any lumps when the breasts are examined by the woman herself or by her doctor. In other women with fibrocystic breasts, the painful breasts and tenderness are constant, and many lumpy or nodular areas can be felt throughout both breasts.' "
Which women develop fibrocystic breasts? Can you have the condition after menopause (postmenopause)?,"'Fibrocystic breast condition primarily affects women 30 years of age and older. The reason for this is that the condition likely results from a cumulative process of repeated monthly hormonal cycles and the accumulation of fluid, cells, and cellular debris within the breast. The process starts with ''puberty'' and continues through menopause. After menopause\xa0(postmenopause), fibrocystic breast condition becomes less of a problem.' "
Can fibrocystic breast condition occur in only one breast?,"'Not usually. As a rule, fibrocystic breast condition tends to be symmetrical (bilateral) and affects both breasts. A woman can have more fibrocystic involvement in one breast than in the other. The less affected breast, however, often ""catches up"" over the years, and eventually both breasts become almost equally fibrocystic.' "
Is there a difference between fibrocystic breast condition and fibrocystic breast disease?,"'No. In the past, fibrocystic breast condition was often called fibrocystic breast disease. However, it is not a disease, but a condition. Most women tend to have some lumpiness in their breasts. Therefore, it is now being more appropriately termed fibrocystic breast condition. The abbreviation is FCC (an acronym derived from FibroCystic breast Condition).''Other names that have been applied to fibrocystic breast condition include mammary dysplasia, chronic cystic ''mastitis'', diffuse cystic mastopathy, and benign breast disease (a term that includes other benign breast disorders, including infections).' "
"What causes cysts, fibrocystic, or ""lumpy"" breasts?","'Fibrocystic breast condition involves the glandular breast tissue. The sole known biologic function of these glands is the production, or secretion, of milk. Occupying a major portion of the breast, the glandular tissue is surrounded by fatty tissue and support elements. The glandular tissue is composed of different types of cells: (1) clusters of secretory cells (cells that produce milk) that are connected to the milk ducts (tiny tubes); and (2) the cells that line the surfaces of the secretory cells, called the epithelial cells.'""The most significant contributing factor to fibrocystic breast condition is a woman's normal hormonal variation during her monthly cycle. Many hormonal changes occur as a woman's body prepares each month for a possible ""'pregnancy''. The most important of these hormones are estrogen and ''progesterone''. They directly affect the breast tissues by causing cells to grow and multiply.''Many hormones aside from estrogen and progesterone also play an important role in causing fibrocystic breasts. ''Prolactin'', growth factor, ''insulin'', and ''thyroid hormone'' are some of the other major hormones that are produced outside of the breast tissue, yet act in important ways on the breast. In addition, the breast itself produces hormonal products from its glandular and fat cells. Signals that are released from these hormonal products are sent to neighboring breast cells. The signals from these hormone-like factors may, in fact, be the key contributors to the symptoms of fibrocystic breast condition. These substances may also enhance the effects of estrogen and progesterone and vice versa.'""The same cyclical hormones that prepare the glandular tissue in the breast for the possibility of milk production (lactation) are also responsible for a woman's ""'menstrual period''. However, there is a major difference between what happens in the breast and uterus.'""In the uterus (the womb), these hormones promote the growth and multiplication of the cells lining the uterus. If pregnancy does not occur, this uterine lining is sloughed off and discharged from a woman's body during ""'menstruation''.''In the breast, these same hormones stimulate the growth of glandular breast tissue. They also increase the activity of blood vessels, cell metabolism, and supporting tissue. All this activity may contribute to the feeling of breast fullness and fluid retention that women commonly experience before their menstrual period.''When the monthly cycle is over, however, these stimulated breast cells cannot simply slough away and pass out of the body like the lining of the uterus. Instead, many of these breast cells undergo a process of programed cell death, called apoptosis. During apoptosis, enzymes are activated that start digesting cells from within. These cells break down and the resulting cellular fragments are then further broken down by scavenger cells (inflammatory cells) and nearby glandular cells.''During this process, the fragments of broken cells and the inflammation may lead to scarring (fibrosis) that damages the ducts and the clusters (lobules) of glandular tissue within the breast. The inflammatory cells and some of the breakdown fragments may release hormone-like substances that in turn act on the nearby glandular, ductal, and structural support cells.''The amount of cellular breakdown products, the degree of inflammation, and the efficiency of the cellular cleanup process in the breast vary from woman to woman. These factors may also fluctuate from month to month in an individual woman. They may even vary in different areas of the same breast.' "
Can caffeine and other foods in the diet cause fibrocystic breasts?,"'Caffeine'' has been implicated as contributing to both the symptoms and scarring (fibrocystic) changes in fibrocystic breast condition. However, when the scientific evidence is reviewed, the results are conflicting, and no firm benefit of ''caffeine'' restriction has been scientifically established. Moreover, there appears to be no evidence that caffeine increases the risk of ''breast cancer''. However, in women with fibrocystic breast condition, a trial of caffeine restriction may be helpful. (Note that coffee is not the only source of caffeine. Tea, ''chocolate'', and certain soft ''drinks'' also contain caffeine.)''At this time, there is a great deal of circumstantial evidence that dietary and hormonal factors can affect fibrocystic breast condition. Still, a firm association between dietary factors and fibrocystic breast condition has not been established.' "
Cysts and fibrosis; Hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia,"'When biopsies (samples) of breast tissue are studied under the microscope, it is possible to identify different types of fibrocystic breast condition. Some cases of fibrocystic breast condition show little disturbance of the breast tissue. Other cases involve a large number of cysts, along with fibrous (''scar'') tissue, in the breast tissue. Additionally, in some cases of fibrocystic breast condition, the breast cells do not have a normal appearance.''Cysts and fibrosis:'' Usually, even when the breast is not stimulated to produce milk, some secretions are produced by the secretory glandular cells. These secretions are normally reabsorbed ""downstream"" in the ducts. However, when there has been tissue damage and scarring (fibrosis) in the breast, these secretions may be trapped in the glandular portions of the breasts, thereby leading to the formation of fluid-filled sacs called cysts. In some areas of the breasts, there may be excessive fluid secretions due to stimulation by hormone-like substances. The resulting cysts may remain microscopic or enlarge until they contain several teaspoons or even tablespoons of fluid. These larger cysts may be felt as palpable (capable of being detected by touching) ''breast lumps''. Even microscopic cysts may sometimes be felt as palpable lumps if many cysts are clustered together and there is a buildup of fibrous (scar) tissue around the cysts.''Hyperplasia and atypical hyperplasia of breast cells:'' With repeated stimulation from normal hormones, and possibly the effects of many of the hormone-like substances produced in the breast, a few of the epithelial cells (cells that line the ducts in the breast) may eventually lose some of their genetic controls, which normally limit their multiplication (cell division). When this happens, cells may proliferate, leading to an abnormal architectural pattern of the epithelial cells. This over-proliferation of cells is termed hyperplasia. Sometimes these proliferating cells begin to appear abnormal and to look different from one another. They are now described as ""atypical."" As other more normal cells continue to cycle, die and break down, these atypical cells can move in, spread out, and accumulate. This extensive overgrowth and accumulation of atypical cells is called atypical hyperplasia.' "
Are fibrocystic breasts associated with an increased risk of breast cancer?,"'Fibrocystic breast condition that involves hyperplasia is associated with a slightly elevated risk of breast ''cancer'', and atypical hyperplasia is associated with a moderately increased risk of breast ''cancer'' when compared to women without fibrocystic changes. This is because genetic errors (mutations) have begun to accumulate in cells that no longer respond normally to the signals that usually control cell growth and division. These cells may also have an impaired ability to repair any genetic damage. As the atypical cells increase in number, they accumulate additional genetic errors.'""Environmental, dietary, and metabolic toxins may also interact with a woman's complex hormonal system to increase the risk of mutations and thus increase the risk of breast ""'cancer''. It has been demonstrated that individuals differ significantly in their ability to break down and remove toxins from the body. Some of this varied response to toxins may be due to ''inherited'' differences. The potential for DNA damage (leading to genetic errors or mutations), which can be caused by a variety of damaging agents combined with the stimulation of cell division, is what ultimately leads to the risk of breast cancer that is associated with some cases of fibrocystic breast condition. The ability to recognize and repair DNA damage, a process that cells must continuously perform, varies from person to person.'  "
What are my chances of getting breast cancer? Is it genetic?,"'Only 5% of women with fibrocystic breast condition have the type of cellular changes, namely cellular hyperplasia, which represents a risk factor for breast cancer. When compared to a ""normal population"" of women, these patients have a two to six fold increased risk of breast cancer. The exact risk depends on the degree of the hyperplasia and whether atypical-appearing cells are also present.''Your doctor also can use a breast cancer risk assessment system called the ""Gail Breast Risk Assessment Tool,"" to calculate your risk. This system takes into account the following factors when calculating an individual woman\'s risk: age (the model is valid only for women aged >35 years), race, age at menarche (the beginning of ''menstruation''), age at first live birth, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, number of previous breast biopsies, and the presence of atypical hyperplasia on any previous breast biopsy.' "
How is fibrocystic breast condition diagnosed? Will I need a breast biopsy?,"'The basic problem with fibrocystic breast condition is the threat of breast cancer. Fibrocystic breast condition is itself benign (non-cancerous) and exceedingly common. Additionally, breast cancer is a common ''malignancy'"" in women. Both conditions, one benign and the other a leading cause of cancer deaths in women involve the same organ - the breast, and both can involve the presence of breast masses. Fibrocystic lumps in the breast can closely mimic those found in breast cancer. They can also sometimes make breast cancer difficult to detect. Therefore, fibrocystic breast condition often makes both the patient and her physician quite concerned about the possibility of breast cancer. If a woman's breasts are fibrocystic, other diagnostic tests in addition to screening ""'mammography'' may be necessary in order to rule out an underlying breast cancer.''A common indicator of fibrocystic breast condition is breast pain or discomfort, but women with fibrocystic breasts may also not have any symptoms. If discomfort is present, the discomfort may include a dull, heavy pain in the breasts, breast tenderness, ''nipple'' ''itching'', and/or a feeling of fullness in the breasts. These symptoms may be persistent or intermittent (coming and going), frequently appearing at the onset of each menstrual period and going away immediately afterwards.''The primary method of diagnosing fibrocystic breast condition is physically touching and feeling (palpation) the lumpy areas in the breast(s). These lumps may be detected by a woman on self-examination or by her physician. This lumpiness is most commonly found in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. (The breast is conventionally divided into quadrants or quarters. The upper outer quadrant is the one closest to the armpit.) The lumps in fibrocystic breast condition are typically mobile (they are not anchored to overlying or underlying tissue). They usually feel rounded, have smooth borders, and may feel rubbery or somewhat changeable in shape. Sometimes, the fibrocystic areas may feel irregular, ridge-like, or like tiny beads. These characteristics all vary from one woman to another.''Extremely fibrocystic breasts in women can be very difficult to examine by palpation (touching and feeling). Even mammograms of such extremely fibrocystic breasts may be difficult to interpret. In these cases, specialized breast ''ultrasound'' exams and other tests can be very helpful for ''cancer screening''. It may sometimes be necessary to obtain a sample (biopsy) of breast tissue with a needle or by surgery in order to make an accurate diagnosis and differentiate between fibrocystic breast condition and breast cancer.'""One reason to undergo a breast biopsy is to diagnose breast cancer. Another reason is to identify those women with fibrocystic breast condition who may have atypical hyperplasia and are at an increased risk of developing breast cancer in the future. However, it is important to note that the severity of a woman's symptoms and clinical signs of fibrocystic breast condition (pain and lumpiness) do not necessarily correlate with the severity or the cellular changes seen under the microscope. Therefore, it is difficult to single out every woman with fibrocystic breast condition for whom a breast biopsy would be useful.""'Additional reasons why breast biopsies are not done on every woman with fibrocystic breast condition include: (1) the invasive nature of the biopsy procedure; (2) the necessity of anesthesia; and (3) cost-benefit considerations. Instead, most women with fibrocystic breast condition are followed over time as if they all are at an increased risk for developing breast cancer. The woman herself must ensure that her clinician is appropriately monitoring her on a regular basis.'  "
"What are the treatments for breast lumps, cysts, and fibrosis?","'The treatments for fibrocystic breast condition are directed at the individual components of the condition, including the relief of symptoms (such as breast pain and tenderness) and the correction of hormonal irregularities:'   Relief of symptoms: Some simple measures, such as adequate support of the breasts and perhaps wearing a bra at night, may provide relief from many of the symptoms of fibrocystic breast condition. Anti-inflammatory medications, for example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen [Motrin, Aleve], and naproxen [Aleve, Naproxyn, Anaprox]), or acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), often reduce the breast pain significantly. There are reports suggesting that a variety of vitamins may be of benefit in relieving the symptoms of fibrocystic breast condition. These have included vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin B6, and vitamin A, among others. In general, the rationale for using these vitamins is unclear and is not based on duplicated, controlled clinical studies. The exception may be vitamin E where, at least in some studies, there appears to be a measurable benefit for some patients. Another food supplement that has been claimed to be of some benefit in clinical studies is Oil of Primrose. This substance contains certain essential fatty acids that allegedly benefit some fibrocystic breast condition patients by reducing their breast pain. There is no evidence showing any correction (resolution) of the microscopic cellular abnormalities with use of this substance, but some women experience symptom relief with this supplement. Hormonal irregularities: Some women with very irregular menstrual cycles progressively suffer more severe fibrocystic breast condition. This tendency is most likely due to the prolonged and irregular hormonal stimulation of the breasts. In these patients, it is sometimes helpful to establish menstrual cycle regularity with oral contraceptives. Regular cycles seem to allow the breast tissue to recover more completely at the end of each menstrual cycle. In patients who have had a hysterectomy and who are on hormone therapy, it may be helpful to be ""off estrogen"" for five days during each monthly cycle rather than remain on continuous estrogen. Again, this schedule is designed to avoid the continuous stimulation of the breast tissues by estrogen. It is important that any such hormone regulation be under the direct supervision of a physician. Certain common hormonal (endocrine) abnormalities, such as diabetes or thyroid dysfunction, may contribute to fibrocystic breast condition. Since these diseases may aggravate the symptoms of fibrocystic breast condition, they should be diagnosed and treated. Studies have shown some benefit from the short-term use of the antiestrogenic drug Tamoxifen in relieving breast pain. However, tamoxifen (Nolvadex) use may be associated with a number of adverse effects, especially in postmenopausal women, and its use should be limited to the short term. Likewise, the androgenic steroid drug danazol (Danocrine) has also been shown to reduce breast pain and nodule size in women with fibrocystic breast condition. Danazol is also associated with a number of serious side effects. Your doctor may consider tamoxifen or danazol if you have severe cyclical breast pain due to the condition."
Living with the pain of fibrocystic breasts,"'Generally, the following measures are recommended for women with fibrocystic breast condition:' Have regular breast examinations by a physician. Examinations may be as often as every four to six months for the highest risk patients, such as those with atypical hyperplasia and a strong family history of breast, ovarian, and/or prostate cancer. Follow an appropriate breast-imaging program. This usually includes yearly mammograms, sometimes with combined with an ultrasound examination. The mammograms should ideally be done under similar conditions (such as at the same point in the woman's menstrual cycle) so that the images on previous mammograms can be meaningfully compared with the newest mammogram. In certain cases, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging test) may be useful. For all women, screening recommendations for breast cancer from the American Cancer Society include having a baseline mammogram between the ages of 35 TO 40 years and subsequently every year from age 40 onwards. However, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that routine screening of women at average risk begin at age 50 rather than 40, and that screening mammograms should occur every two years up to age 74. Women should speak with their doctor about their own risk factors to determine an appropriate screening program. Understand the statistical risk of breast cancer based on all available information. Professional counseling may be necessary to help the woman with this goal. Most patients overestimate their personal and immediate risk. There should be some reassurance that, although it is necessary to be attentive, most women with fibrocystic breast condition will never develop breast cancer. There must be a balance between careful surveillance and quality of life. According to American Cancer Society recommendations, breast self-examination is an option for women starting during their 20s, but it has certain limitations. If you choose to do breast self-examination, it is important to learn the proper technique. The self-examination of the breast is best done when there is the least amount of hormonal stimulation of the breast. This occurs 7 to 10 days after the start of the last menstrual cycle (or three days after a period ends). At that time, the fluid retention in the breast and the cellular growth activity are minimal. An ideal setting in which to conduct the exam is the bath or shower. First, with the hand and breast wet with soap, the woman should begin with the fingers flat together and work sweeping from the outer part to the center of the breast. It helps to mentally divide the area into four sections (quadrants) and work around them in sequence. The upper outer quadrant should be mentally extended into the armpit (to examine the part of the breast that often reaches into the armpit). Second, the process is repeated in the same sequence with the fingers moving in a fluttering motion. These different motions, flat-fingered stroking and fluttering fingertips, allow detection of somewhat different types of tissue abnormalities. This examination by feeling the breast (palpation) should be accompanied by a brief visual exam. With the arms at the sides looking in a mirror, the woman should note the evenness (symmetry) of the breasts. Then the woman should raise her arms slowly overhead, checking for any areas 'tugging' the skin or any visible lumps or distortion. The entire examination process can be done in a few minutes."
Facts you should know about fibromyalgia,"  Fibromyalgia is a pain syndrome characterized by chronic pain, fatigue, and tenderness to touch. Fibromyalgia syndrome is the most common medical cause of chronic, widespread pain in the United States. Fibromyalgia affects 2%-4% of people, mostly women. Defining fibromyalgia symptoms and signs includechronic pain, which may be in the muscles, joints, and/or bones,fatigue,sleep problems, andtenderness throughout the body to light touch. chronic pain, which may be in the muscles, joints, and/or bones, fatigue, sleep problems, and tenderness throughout the body to light touch. Those with fibromyalgia may also experiencedepression and/or anxiety,cognitive difficulties, such as forgetfulness and lack of concentration (fibro fog),abdominal pain,dry eyes,chest wall pain,dry mouth,bladder symptoms,pelvic pain,heart palpitations,numbness and tingling,chemical sensitivities and multiple allergies, andweight gain. depression and/or anxiety, cognitive difficulties, such as forgetfulness and lack of concentration (fibro fog), abdominal pain, dry eyes, chest wall pain, dry mouth, bladder symptoms, pelvic pain, heart palpitations, numbness and tingling, chemical sensitivities and multiple allergies, and weight gain. Exercise and getting enough sleep are very important in the management of fibromyalgia. Taking medications can help relieve the pain. The fact is there is no test to detect fibromyalgia. When a health care professional suspects fibromyalgia, sometimes tests are necessary to exclude other medical conditions."
What is fibromyalgia?,'Fibromyalgia syndrome is a ''chronic pain'' condition (not a type of ''arthritis'') that affects 4% of people in the United States. The pain syndrome commonly affects the muscles and ligaments and usually has been present for years when a health care professional diagnoses the condition. Fibromyalgia was formerly known as fibrositis.' 
What causes fibromyalgia?,"'Fibromyalgia syndrome has been shown to be genetic. The disorder frequently becomes evident after stressful events. The stressful events may be emotional (such as a traumatic life event), physical (such as a motor-vehicle accident), or medical (such as certain infections). The chronic pain of ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', and other health conditions and autoimmune diseases can trigger the development of fibromyalgia.''The manner in which the brain and spinal cord process pain sensations is abnormal in fibromyalgia. The threshold at which stimuli cause pain or discomfort has been proven to be lower in fibromyalgia. The pain felt is more intense because the pain is amplified by the abnormalities in the central nervous system and in pain processing. Because of this, things that are not normally painful may be painful for someone with fibromyalgia. In addition, fibromyalgia causes the pain from any given cause to be worse. For example, a patient with fibromyalgia may find a ''massage'' painful instead of pleasant. In addition, ''back pain'' that someone without fibromyalgia experiences as moderate may be experienced as severe by someone with fibromyalgia, because the pain is amplified by abnormalities in pain processing by the central nervous system.' "
Is fibromyalgia hereditary?,"'Increasing evidence supports a strong genetic component to fibromyalgia. Siblings, parents, and children of people with fibromyalgia are eight times more likely to have the disorder than those who have no relatives with the health condition. Several genes that have been suspected to play a role in fibromyalgia syndrome. Studies in twins suggest that half the risk of fibromyalgia and related disorders is genetic and half is environmental.' "
What are risk factors for fibromyalgia?,"'Because it is in part hereditary, a family history of fibromyalgia syndrome is a risk factor for the development of fibromyalgia. Other risk factors include autoimmune diseases such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''lupus'', and ''ankylosing spondylitis'', as people with these diseases are more likely to have fibromyalgia than the general population. These patients are referred to as having ""secondary fibromyalgia"" because the autoimmune disease may trigger fibromyalgia.''Other emotional and physical stressors such as physical ''trauma'' (especially involving the spine and trunk), emotional ''stress'', and certain infections (''hepatitis C'', ''Epstein-Barr virus'', parvovirus, and ''Lyme disease'' but '' not'' the ''common cold'') are associated with the development of fibromyalgia in some.' "
What are fibromyalgia symptoms and signs? What are fibromyalgia tender points?,"'The defining feature of fibromyalgia syndrome is chronic widespread pain and tenderness. This means pain in multiple areas of the body, most commonly in muscles, tendons, and joints. ''Joint stiffness''\xa0and ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS'') are common, as well. The pain is generally above and below the waist, on the left side of the body and on the right side of the body but can be localized, often in the neck and shoulders or low back, initially. The pain is chronic, which means it is present for more than three months. People commonly feel as if they ""hurt all over"" with ''flu-like symptoms'', or are about to develop a ''cold'' or the ''flu''. It is common for some days to be worse than others are, and many patients report ""flare-ups"" where their pain and other symptoms are worse for several days in a row or longer.''Fatigue'' is the other universal symptom of fibromyalgia. It is most noticeable upon awakening, but it may also be marked in the mid-afternoon. It is very common to wake up in the morning not feeling refreshed, even after sleeping through the night. Patients commonly feel they sleep ""lightly"" and may have multiple nighttime awakenings with difficulty returning to sleep.''While widespread pain, fatigue, and ''sleep problems'' are the defining symptoms of the syndrome, fibromyalgia is associated with many other symptoms. ''Disordered thinking'' (cognitive disturbances) is often referred to as ""fibro fog."" Patients describe difficulty with attention and completing tasks, as well as a general sense of being in a fog.''Depression'' and ''anxiety'' co-occur in 30%-50% of patients at the time of diagnosis with fibromyalgia. ''Headaches'' are present in more than half of patients. Patients also may have a variety of poorly understood additional symptoms, including ''abdominal pain'', ''diarrhea'', ''constipation'', ''nausea'', ''dry eyes'', ''dry mouth'', chest wall pain, ''pelvic pain'', and bladder symptoms, heart ''palpitations'', numbness and tingling (pins and needles), multiple ''allergies'' and chemical sensitivities, weight gain, and others.''The physical examination is remarkable for tenderness, particularly in specific anatomic locations, such as the back of the neck where the neck muscles connect to the skull. There are 18 such locations, which are referred to as fibromyalgia tender points. In the past, studies required patients to have 11 out of a possible 18 fibromyalgia tender points in order to be included in a scientific study on fibromyalgia, but this definition of fibromyalgia has changed in the past few years.'  "
How do health care professionals test for and diagnose fibromyalgia?,"""Health care professionals diagnose fibromyalgia based on the patient's symptoms, primarily widespread pain. Chronic widespread pain in the muscles and joints, in combination with fatigue and poor sleep, lead to the consideration of fibromyalgia. A health care professional will perform a thorough history and physical exam to exclude other illnesses presenting with similar symptoms.""'There is no widely accepted blood test or X-ray test for fibromyalgia at this time. Any testing is done to exclude other conditions. Tests for inflammation are generally normal in isolated fibromyalgia.''Usually multiple soft-tissue areas (""fibromyalgia tender points"") are tender to palpation. However, not all patients are tender at the tender points. In general, females are more likely to be tender at the classic fibromyalgia tender points than males.''The American College of ''Rheumatology'' developed new guidelines and diagnostic criteria to help diagnose patients with fibromyalgia. The new guidelines no longer require a certain number of tender points to be present to be confident that a patient has fibromyalgia. The new guidelines use pain and other ''symptoms of fibromyalgia'' to aid diagnosis. Patient questionnaires to assist in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia can be found online.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat fibromyalgia?,"'Rheumatologists'', internists, family medicine doctors, pain-management doctors, physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors, and primary care providers all treat fibromyalgia. Health care practitioners other than physicians are also frequently involved in the treatment of fibromyalgia, including clinical psychologists, physical therapists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.' "
What is the treatment for fibromyalgia?,"'There are both medication and non-medication treatments for fibromyalgia. Medication treatments frequently help manage the pain and ''sleeplessness'' from which fibromyalgia patients suffer. However, the non-medication treatments are really the basis of treatment for fibromyalgia. The non-medication treatments for fibromyalgia include education, ''exercise'', and ''stress'' reduction. ''Sleep disorders'' may require both medication and non-medication treatments.''Education about fibromyalgia is very important. Often patients have suffered with symptoms for years, and simply knowing why they have pain can be a relief, as many patients become anxious not knowing what is causing their symptoms. Patients should also be educated about treatment approaches, good sleep hygiene, and the importance of treating conditions that may contribute to their symptoms. For example, when a patient with ''rheumatoid arthritis'' has fibromyalgia as well, poor control of their ''rheumatoid arthritis'' may lead to worsening of fibromyalgia pain and sleeplessness.''An exercise program is crucial in the treatment of fibromyalgia and should include stretching, strengthening, and ''aerobic exercise''. Many patients with fibromyalgia find it difficult to institute a regular exercise program because they feel they are too tired to exercise and they may perceive that their pain and fatigue worsen when they begin to exercise. However, numerous scientific studies have shown that exercise for fibromyalgia, especially aerobic exercise, can improve pain, physical function, and a sense of well-being. Starting slow and sticking with the exercise program is very important. Low-impact aerobic activities such as ''swimming'', water aerobics, ''walking'', and biking are activities that patients with fibromyalgia find helpful. Many patients find it helpful to exercise in the morning. Some patients find ''yoga'' helpful for strengthening and stretching. An aerobic exercise program should also accompany this.'""Stress reduction is important for the self-management of fibromyalgia symptoms. Many patients feel that their symptoms are triggered by stress. Stress reduction can be challenging. There are many stressors in life; some can be changed and others cannot. Stress reduction involves a combination of changing stressors that can be changed and learning to lessen the body's stress reaction to the stressors that cannot be changed.""'Cognitive behavioral therapy'' is a form of psychological therapy whereby a therapist and patient work together, to establish healthy patterns of behavior by replacing negative thoughts with more productive thoughts and actions. This has been proven to work in fibromyalgia. This form of therapy can be done one on one in an office setting, or even over the Internet.''The non-medication therapies are the cornerstone of treatment for fibromyalgia. With them, many people improve and may not require medications. Moreover, without focusing on sleep hygiene, stress reduction and exercise, it is difficult to improve, even with medication.''When used with non-medication therapies, medication treatments can help improve sleep, pain, and function in fibromyalgia. Administration of medications is most effective for pain relief when combined with ongoing non-medication treatments as discussed above. Medications often used in the treatment of fibromyalgia include medications in the ''antidepressant'' class (medications originally developed to treat ''anxiety'' and ''depression'') and anticonvulsants (medications originally developed to treat ''seizures'').''A few notes on other treatments for fibromyalgia: ''Acupuncture'' can be helpful for some patients with fibromyalgia but is not usually recommended as one of the first-line treatments for fibromyalgia because the scientific studies on ''acupuncture'' for fibromyalgia patients have not shown definite benefit. Likewise, trigger point injections help for some patients. Alternative medicines have not been proven to be helpful in fibromyalgia; in particular, scientific studies on ''guaifenesin'' (''Mucinex'') show that it does not work. Of note, patients with ''vitamin D deficiency'' can have widespread ''arthralgia'' and ''myalgia'', like fibromyalgia, which improves with ''vitamin D'' supplementation. While having a sufficient level of ''vitamin D'' is important to maintain bone health, a healthy immune system, and perhaps prevent certain types of ''cancer'', ''vitamin D'' supplementation does not improve fibromyalgia symptoms in patients who have sufficient levels of vitamin D. Narcotic pain medications should be avoided in fibromyalgia because they may worsen the underlying problem.'   Medications called ""tricyclic antidepressants"" have been used to treat fibromyalgia for many years. These medications include amitriptyline (Elavil), doxepin (Sinequan, Silenor), and desipramine (Norpramin). These medications are generally started in low doses and increased until adequate response is achieved. The advantage of these medications is that they are effective for sleep and pain, widely available, and less costly for most patients than some of the newer agents. Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) is a medication that is both a muscle relaxant and tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to help with sleep and pain in patients with fibromyalgia. Medications in the antidepressant class that affect the serotonin and the norepinephrine neurotransmitters (SNRI antidepressants) are frequently used in the treatment of fibromyalgia. These medications include duloxetine (Cymbalta), milnacipran (Savella), and venlafaxine (Effexor). Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter in the brain, and increasing the levels of norepinephrine with these medications decreases pain levels. Fluoxetine (Prozac) is an antidepressant that affects mainly serotonin at low doses but increases norepinephrine as well at higher doses. Higher doses of fluoxetine can be used to treat fibromyalgia pain. Pregabalin (Lyrica) and gabapentin (Neurontin) are anticonvulsants (medications initially developed to treat seizures). There are many scientific studies showing that pregabalin and gabapentin can be effective for fibromyalgia pain. Tramadol (Ultram) is an opioid pain reliever, which is helpful in some patients with fibromyalgia but should be used with caution as sometimes the use of opioids can worsen the pain cycle in fibromyalgia. Memantine (Namenda) is a medication commonly used for dementia. Preliminary studies show that memantine may be helpful with pain and other symptoms of fibromyalgia, but further studies are needed to confirm this. There have been small scientific studies of low-dose naltrexone (Revia, Vivitrol) in fibromyalgia. Naltrexone's main scientifically proven use is in treating narcotic addiction. In one small study, a very low dose of naltrexone was shown to benefit some patients with fibromyalgia. Further studies of low-dose naltrexone in fibromyalgia are needed to know if it really works."
Are there any home remedies for fibromyalgia?,"'The non-medication treatments for fibromyalgia are the cornerstone of treatment of the syndrome. These include lifestyle changes like education, stress reduction, improving sleep, and exercise.'  "
What is the prognosis of fibromyalgia?,"'The overall mortality is not increased in patients with fibromyalgia, and it is not an organ-threatening disease. However, many patients with fibromyalgia continue to suffer from long-term widespread pain. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, many fibromyalgia patients find their overall sense of well-being and their pain improves to pain levels that are more moderate\xa0 with the treatments discussed above. There are some patients who experience a dramatic reduction in pain with changes in their life to reduce stress. However, these patients are always at risk for worsening of their symptoms in the future and should maintain efforts for a healthy lifestyle, including sleep hygiene, ongoing exercise, and ''stress management''. Fibromyalgia patients have a higher rate of disability than the general population, but seeking permanent disability status is generally discouraged because it frequently leads to worsening of symptoms.' "
Is it possible to prevent fibromyalgia?,"'Fibromyalgia is a syndrome with a genetic predisposition. It can be triggered by certain events, but the exact events leading to the onset of fibromyalgia is unknown. Because of this, there is no known way to prevent fibromyalgia. However, leading a healthy lifestyle, including getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and exercising, is the best way to stay healthy.' "
Are there support groups for fibromyalgia?,"'Yes, there are support groups for fibromyalgia. Local support groups and further information can be found through the Arthritis Foundation (http://www.arthritis.org), National Fibromyalgia Association (http://www.fmaware.org), or the National Fibromyalgia Partnership, Inc. (http://www.fmpartnership.org).' "
What is the latest research on fibromyalgia?,"'There is ongoing medical research on fibromyalgia on many fronts. There is active research on the genes responsible for fibromyalgia, new medications, and new non-medication therapies to help pain. One recent study found that non-restorative sleep -- when one wakes up feeling tired after a full night of sleep -- is strongly tied to developing widespread pain. Medical researchers have linked ''anxiety'' to developing widespread pain.' "
What is rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' (''RA'"") is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the joints. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are mistakenly attacked by their own immune system by an abnormal, misdirected immune system response. Inflammation of the joints and tissue around the joints are characteristic features of ""'rheumatoid arthritis'' that are caused by the autoimmune process. Because it can affect multiple other organs of the body, ''RA'' is referred to as a systemic illness (in fact, sometimes it is referred to as ''rheumatoid disease'').' "
What is fibromyalgia?,"'Fibromyalgia'' syndrome is a ''chronic pain'' condition that affects 4% of people in the United States. Many patients experience ''pain'' all over their body. ''Sleep'' that is not restful is another hallmark of ''fibromyalgia'', causing ''chronic fatigue'"". While patients with fibromyalgia may feel as though their joints, muscles, tendons, and tissues are inflamed, measurable levels of inflammation in blood testing are normal. Fibromyalgia can be very painful and greatly affect a patient's quality of life in many ways, but it does not cause damage to organs or joints."" "
What are signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia?,"'The defining feature of ''rheumatoid arthritis symptoms'' are\xa0\xa0''The defining features of fibromyalgia are\xa0''fatigue'' with widespread ''pain'' and tenderness. Patients with fibromyalgia may have many other symptoms as well, including'   joint inflammation, which causes joint pain, swelling, and redness. The swelling is present for more than six weeks and is usually on both sides of the body in the same joint (for example in both wrists). brain fog (fibro fog), tingling or numbness in the feet or hands that comes and goes, anxiety, depression, bowel irritability, and many others."
What are home remedies and treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia?," The treatment of fibromyalgia always involves getting enough sleep, exercising, and stress reduction. Medications can be used to treat fibromyalgia pain as well as improve sleep. Getting enough sleep, exercising, and stress reduction are also very important in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, medications are necessary to reduce joint inflammation and prevent joint damage. Without treatment, RA grows progressively worse and damages joints. There are many medications that have been proven to slow or stop the course of rheumatoid arthritis."
What are causes and risk factors of rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia?,"'The causes of rheumatoid ''arthritis'' are partially genetic and partially environmental. Certain genes predispose people to developing ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and that is why it runs strongly in some families. Environmental risk factors for ''RA'' include ''cigarette smoking'' and female sex.''Fibromyalgia is in part genetic and can be triggered by stressful events. The stressful event can be physical, such as a car accident, or emotional. The ''chronic pain'' of autoimmune diseases such as ''RA'' and ''systemic lupus erythematosus'' can sometimes trigger fibromyalgia.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to make a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' is diagnosed based on persistent joint inflammation for more than 6 weeks. Blood tests are commonly abnormal in rheumatoid ''arthritis'', including the erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' (ESR) inflammation level, and ''rheumatoid factor'' (RF), and ''citrulline antibody'' (anti-CCP antibody).''The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is made based on symptoms of chronic widespread pain and ''fatigue'' and signs of widespread tenderness. Many people have both rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia, but fibromyalgia does not cause rheumatoid arthritis or progress into it.'  "
What is the prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia?,"'The prognosis of fibromyalgia is very good, in that people with fibromyalgia do not suffer damage to their joints, muscles, or organs. However, fibromyalgia pain is chronic and improves with lifestyle changes and medications to a manageable level.''There have been tremendous advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the past decade, and many medications are now available to stop or slow the disease. Currently, the goal of treatment is low disease activity or disease remission, where patients have few or no swollen and tender joints and low systemic inflammation blood levels.' "
Is it possible to prevent rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia?,"'There is no known ''prevention'' of rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia. Living a healthy lifestyle, eating healthy foods (including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean meats), getting plenty of sleep, not drinking excessive ''alcohol'', not ''smoking'' tobacco, and not using ''drugs'' may help the body function at its best.' "
What is fibromyalgia?,"'Fibromyalgia'' is a common neurologic health problem that causes widespread ''pain'' and tenderness in the body. It is accompanied by ''fatigue'', disturbances in thought and memory, low ''moods'', and extreme ''anxiety'' about the physical symptoms (somatic symptoms).''Fibromyalgia'' affects approximately five million Americans every year and mostly affects women, although some men may also be affected by it. ''Fibromyalgia'' commonly affects middle-aged individuals; however, children may also be affected at times.' "
What are the causes of fibromyalgia?,"'Causes of fibromyalgia are unclear; however, researchers have claimed that there’s an involvement of the nervous system, particularly the central nervous system. Fibromyalgia is not due to autoimmune, inflammation, joint, or muscle disorder. There may be some trigger factors that prompt fibromyalgia and other health problems, which include:' Genes Spine injuries Arthritis Physical stress Emotional stress Autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus Trauma Multiple surgeries Chronic stress"
What are the symptoms of fibromyalgia?,"'The core ''symptoms of fibromyalgia'' involve:''Other less common symptoms include:' Widespread pain throughout the body Fatigue Sleep disturbances Tenderness on touching Poor attention span or memory Depression or anxiety Headache Numbness, tingling, prickling, or burning sensation in both arms and legs Digestive problems such as irritable bowel syndrome or gastroesophageal reflux disease Pelvic pain Face or jaw pain Jaw clicking and ringing in the ears Joint stiffness Painful menstrual periods Painful bladder syndrome Dry eyes"
How is fibromyalgia diagnosed?,"'The physician may diagnose fibromyalgia based on the symptoms. The physician may examine for symptoms such as longstanding body pain and tenderness before confirming fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia does not show any abnormalities in the routine lab tests; hence, physicians may recommend tests only to rule out other health problems.''Criteria needed for diagnosing fibromyalgia are as follows:' Pain persists for more than three months Fatigue Chronic migraine and headache Waking unrefreshed Problems with thinking and memory Pain in more than one area throughout the body No other health problem that would explain the pain and symptoms"
How is fibromyalgia treated?,"'There’s no treatment for fibromyalgia as such, although symptoms may be managed with medications and alternative treatment.''Alternative treatment or nondrug therapies along with medications can treat the symptoms. The most common nondrug therapies include:''Complementary and alternative medicine'':''Trigger factors should also be addressed while treating fibromyalgia.''Medications such as ''Cymbalta'' (''duloxetine''), ''Savella'' (''milnacipran''), and ''Lyrica'' (''pregabalin'') have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for fibromyalgia. They alter brain chemicals (serotonin and norepinephrine) to control pain levels. The physician may also prescribe the following medications:' Physical exercise Regular aerobic exercise Tai chi Yoga Cognitive behavioral therapy Mindfulness-based stress reduction Acupuncture Chiropractic Massage therapy Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Motrin (ibuprofen), Aleve (naproxen), and Tylenol (acetaminophen) Opioid medication, such as Ultram (tramadol) for short-term use Antidepressants Sleep-inducing medications such as Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine), Elavil (amitriptyline), Neurontin (gabapentin), or Lyrica (pregabalin)"
What is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is defined as a specific form of progressive fibrosis that causes interstitial ''pneumonia'', usually in older adults and is limited to the ''lungs''. Fibrotic (''scar''-like) tissue develops in the airways of the lungs, making it difficult for the body to get the oxygen it needs. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis differs from pulmonary fibrosis in that the cause is unknown whereas there are known causes of pulmonary fibrosis. Though not very common, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is considered to be debilitating, incurable, and terminal, by many health-care professionals and researchers.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'The symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are not specific, and are similar to many other types of pulmonary cardiac diseases. The majority of people with the disease have about a 6-month or more history of ''shortness of breath'' and/or nonproductive ''cough''. About 5% of people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis do not have symptoms, and the disease is diagnosed when he or she is being examined for other medical problems.''The signs and symptoms that may occur in some people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are:'   Six months or greater history of shortness of breath and/or cough Fatigue Mild fevers Weight loss Joint discomfort Muscle pain Clubbing or enlargement of fingers Ankle swelling Heart murmur (tricuspid regurgitation)"
What causes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Inclusion of the word ""idiopathic"" means that this type of fibrosis has an unknown cause. Current hypotheses include exposure to some type of agent (for example, environmental dust, viral infection, reflux, aspiration of gastrointestinal contents, and others) that leads to the alveolar damage in the lungs. Researchers further hypothesize that in attempt to repair the alveolar damage, fibrosis and lung scarring occur to produce eventually clinical pulmonary fibrosis.' "
What are the stages of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Staging systems for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may help health-care professionals and researchers to better define the medical condition of their patients. However, for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, staging systems are constantly being redefined. For example, the first staging systems traditionally considered the disease as mild, moderate, or severe while others considered stages as early or advanced. The stages are relatively arbitrary and loosely based on pulmonary function tests. Unfortunately, there are no standardized definitions for mild, moderate, and severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Though arbitrary, these staging systems give health-care professionals a framework to diagnose and treat patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.''For example, some doctors consider treatment with ''pirfenidone'' for mild to moderate disease, and lung transplantation for severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. There are researchers that have developed novel idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis staging systems based on other criteria such as age, hospitalization, baseline lung function, and a 24-week change in function, while other researchers choose other parameters such as various physiological lung measurements. The patient and their physician(s) can discuss which staging system they choose to utilize.' "
Is there a test to diagnosis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is somewhat difficult. It is a diagnosis of exclusion of other known causes of ''interstitial lung disease'' including environmental and drug exposures. Currently, there are no laboratory studies that can ultimately diagnose idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; however, up to 30% of people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may have positive tests for antinuclear antibodies and/or ''rheumatoid factor''.''High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is somewhat more specific and sensitive for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diagnoses although not definitive, the same is true for pulmonary function tests. However, repeated pulmonary function tests that show declines over six months, when taken into account with other non-specific findings, add to the possible diagnosis. However, a pattern of usual interstitial ''pneumonia'' (UIP) on HRCT requires four features for diagnosis of interstitial ''pneumonia'':''Bronchoscopy'' and surgical lung biopsy are also used to help distinguish between UIP and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Consequently, the newest diagnostic criteria of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis requires the following:' Subplural, basal predominance of ground glass opacity Reticular abnormalities Honeycombing with or without traction bronchiectasis Absence of features listed as inconsistent with UIP Exclusion of other known causes of interstitial lung disease (environmental exposures, connective tissue disease, and/or drug toxicities) The presence of a UIP pattern, described above, on HRCT in patients not subjected to surgical biopsy Specific combinations of HRCT and surgical lung biopsy patterns in patients subjected to surgical lung biopsy"
Treatment guidelines for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"'The treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis depends upon the stage of the disease, and usually begins with medical treatment, supportive measures, and possibly surgical transplantation of the lungs. Often, during the mild to moderate disease medical care is initiated. However, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis sometimes progresses rapidly, so if idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is diagnosed, a transplant surgeon should be consulted early as the person with IPF may eventually require lung transplant.''Guidelines on the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have been published by several institutions including the American, European, Japanese, Latin American thoracic societies and/or associations. The following is an abbreviated summary of these guidelines:''Patients should discuss with their doctors on how this progressive disease is best treated on an individual basis.'  They conditionally recommend the use of pirfenidone and nintedanib, both approved by the FDA in 2014. They do not conditionally recommend the use of imatinib (Gleevec), warfarin (Warfarin, Jantoven), combination prednisone with N-acetylcysteine, and several other drugs. They conditionally recommend anti-acid medications even in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients without symptoms of reflux. Encourage the patient to quit any smoking. Encourage vaccination against influenza and pneumococcal infections. They suggest patients with hypoxemia (low oxygen in the blood, for example, pulse oximetry measured less than 88%) use oxygen therapies to maintain a saturation at least 90% during all activities, including sleeping."
Lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,"'Lung transplantation is considered when the patient develops severe stage (also termed end stage) idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Lung transplantation does show a survival benefit over medical therapy. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has now replaced ''chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (''COPD'') as the most common reason for lung transplantation in the US.''Any patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis should be referred to a transplant surgeon to determine early on if the patient may meet criteria for a lung transplant. Some people may qualify for a single or a double lung transplant. Reported five-year survival rates for lung transplantation are about 50% to 56%.''Criteria for a transplant vary somewhat so it is important to have the patient and the medical team (primary care physician, ''pulmonologist'', and transplant surgeon) all agree on the potential criteria for the individual patient.' "
"What is the life expectancy and prognosis for a person with idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)?","'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has a poor prognosis. The mean survival time or ""life expectancy"" is about 2 to 5 years from the time of diagnosis. Most commonly, the person experiences an acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and then dies because of the disease. Individuals with IPF who undergo lung transplant have a mortality rate of about 50% to 56% after five years so the transplant may increase the life expectancy in some people with the disease.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis?,"'Although primary care physicians help manage patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, usually a pulmonologist (a lung specialist) is consulted during the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Some doctors suggest a lung transplant surgeon be consulted when the patient is diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis unless there are contraindications (Lung transplant may be more harmful to some people.) for transplantation.''Because of the high incidence of gastroesophageal reflux (''GERD'') in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a ''gastroenterologist'' may be consulted.' "
Can idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis be prevented?,"'Because idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is ""idiopathic,"" ''prevention'' is difficult. However, many health-care professionals and researchers theorize that the risk of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may be reduced in some people if they ''quit smoking'', and reduce or eliminate their exposure to toxins or fumes that have the potential to damage the lungs.' "
Support for families and friends,"'There are support groups for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and their families, for example, the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation (''www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org'') and the American Lung Association (''www.lung.org'').' "
Facts you should know about fibromyalgia,"  Fibromyalgia is a pain syndrome characterized by chronic pain, fatigue, and tenderness to touch. Fibromyalgia syndrome is the most common medical cause of chronic, widespread pain in the United States. Fibromyalgia affects 2%-4% of people, mostly women. Defining fibromyalgia symptoms and signs includechronic pain, which may be in the muscles, joints, and/or bones,fatigue,sleep problems, andtenderness throughout the body to light touch. chronic pain, which may be in the muscles, joints, and/or bones, fatigue, sleep problems, and tenderness throughout the body to light touch. Those with fibromyalgia may also experiencedepression and/or anxiety,cognitive difficulties, such as forgetfulness and lack of concentration (fibro fog),abdominal pain,dry eyes,chest wall pain,dry mouth,bladder symptoms,pelvic pain,heart palpitations,numbness and tingling,chemical sensitivities and multiple allergies, andweight gain. depression and/or anxiety, cognitive difficulties, such as forgetfulness and lack of concentration (fibro fog), abdominal pain, dry eyes, chest wall pain, dry mouth, bladder symptoms, pelvic pain, heart palpitations, numbness and tingling, chemical sensitivities and multiple allergies, and weight gain. Exercise and getting enough sleep are very important in the management of fibromyalgia. Taking medications can help relieve the pain. The fact is there is no test to detect fibromyalgia. When a health care professional suspects fibromyalgia, sometimes tests are necessary to exclude other medical conditions."
What is fibromyalgia?,'Fibromyalgia syndrome is a ''chronic pain'' condition (not a type of ''arthritis'') that affects 4% of people in the United States. The pain syndrome commonly affects the muscles and ligaments and usually has been present for years when a health care professional diagnoses the condition. Fibromyalgia was formerly known as fibrositis.' 
What causes fibromyalgia?,"'Fibromyalgia syndrome has been shown to be genetic. The disorder frequently becomes evident after stressful events. The stressful events may be emotional (such as a traumatic life event), physical (such as a motor-vehicle accident), or medical (such as certain infections). The chronic pain of ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', and other health conditions and autoimmune diseases can trigger the development of fibromyalgia.''The manner in which the brain and spinal cord process pain sensations is abnormal in fibromyalgia. The threshold at which stimuli cause pain or discomfort has been proven to be lower in fibromyalgia. The pain felt is more intense because the pain is amplified by the abnormalities in the central nervous system and in pain processing. Because of this, things that are not normally painful may be painful for someone with fibromyalgia. In addition, fibromyalgia causes the pain from any given cause to be worse. For example, a patient with fibromyalgia may find a ''massage'' painful instead of pleasant. In addition, ''back pain'' that someone without fibromyalgia experiences as moderate may be experienced as severe by someone with fibromyalgia, because the pain is amplified by abnormalities in pain processing by the central nervous system.' "
Is fibromyalgia hereditary?,"'Increasing evidence supports a strong genetic component to fibromyalgia. Siblings, parents, and children of people with fibromyalgia are eight times more likely to have the disorder than those who have no relatives with the health condition. Several genes that have been suspected to play a role in fibromyalgia syndrome. Studies in twins suggest that half the risk of fibromyalgia and related disorders is genetic and half is environmental.' "
What are risk factors for fibromyalgia?,"'Because it is in part hereditary, a family history of fibromyalgia syndrome is a risk factor for the development of fibromyalgia. Other risk factors include autoimmune diseases such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''lupus'', and ''ankylosing spondylitis'', as people with these diseases are more likely to have fibromyalgia than the general population. These patients are referred to as having ""secondary fibromyalgia"" because the autoimmune disease may trigger fibromyalgia.''Other emotional and physical stressors such as physical ''trauma'' (especially involving the spine and trunk), emotional ''stress'', and certain infections (''hepatitis C'', ''Epstein-Barr virus'', parvovirus, and ''Lyme disease'' but '' not'' the ''common cold'') are associated with the development of fibromyalgia in some.' "
What are fibromyalgia symptoms and signs? What are fibromyalgia tender points?,"'The defining feature of fibromyalgia syndrome is chronic widespread pain and tenderness. This means pain in multiple areas of the body, most commonly in muscles, tendons, and joints. ''Joint stiffness''\xa0and ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS'') are common, as well. The pain is generally above and below the waist, on the left side of the body and on the right side of the body but can be localized, often in the neck and shoulders or low back, initially. The pain is chronic, which means it is present for more than three months. People commonly feel as if they ""hurt all over"" with ''flu-like symptoms'', or are about to develop a ''cold'' or the ''flu''. It is common for some days to be worse than others are, and many patients report ""flare-ups"" where their pain and other symptoms are worse for several days in a row or longer.''Fatigue'' is the other universal symptom of fibromyalgia. It is most noticeable upon awakening, but it may also be marked in the mid-afternoon. It is very common to wake up in the morning not feeling refreshed, even after sleeping through the night. Patients commonly feel they sleep ""lightly"" and may have multiple nighttime awakenings with difficulty returning to sleep.''While widespread pain, fatigue, and ''sleep problems'' are the defining symptoms of the syndrome, fibromyalgia is associated with many other symptoms. ''Disordered thinking'' (cognitive disturbances) is often referred to as ""fibro fog."" Patients describe difficulty with attention and completing tasks, as well as a general sense of being in a fog.''Depression'' and ''anxiety'' co-occur in 30%-50% of patients at the time of diagnosis with fibromyalgia. ''Headaches'' are present in more than half of patients. Patients also may have a variety of poorly understood additional symptoms, including ''abdominal pain'', ''diarrhea'', ''constipation'', ''nausea'', ''dry eyes'', ''dry mouth'', chest wall pain, ''pelvic pain'', and bladder symptoms, heart ''palpitations'', numbness and tingling (pins and needles), multiple ''allergies'' and chemical sensitivities, weight gain, and others.''The physical examination is remarkable for tenderness, particularly in specific anatomic locations, such as the back of the neck where the neck muscles connect to the skull. There are 18 such locations, which are referred to as fibromyalgia tender points. In the past, studies required patients to have 11 out of a possible 18 fibromyalgia tender points in order to be included in a scientific study on fibromyalgia, but this definition of fibromyalgia has changed in the past few years.'  "
How do health care professionals test for and diagnose fibromyalgia?,"""Health care professionals diagnose fibromyalgia based on the patient's symptoms, primarily widespread pain. Chronic widespread pain in the muscles and joints, in combination with fatigue and poor sleep, lead to the consideration of fibromyalgia. A health care professional will perform a thorough history and physical exam to exclude other illnesses presenting with similar symptoms.""'There is no widely accepted blood test or X-ray test for fibromyalgia at this time. Any testing is done to exclude other conditions. Tests for inflammation are generally normal in isolated fibromyalgia.''Usually multiple soft-tissue areas (""fibromyalgia tender points"") are tender to palpation. However, not all patients are tender at the tender points. In general, females are more likely to be tender at the classic fibromyalgia tender points than males.''The American College of ''Rheumatology'' developed new guidelines and diagnostic criteria to help diagnose patients with fibromyalgia. The new guidelines no longer require a certain number of tender points to be present to be confident that a patient has fibromyalgia. The new guidelines use pain and other ''symptoms of fibromyalgia'' to aid diagnosis. Patient questionnaires to assist in the diagnosis of fibromyalgia can be found online.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat fibromyalgia?,"'Rheumatologists'', internists, family medicine doctors, pain-management doctors, physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors, and primary care providers all treat fibromyalgia. Health care practitioners other than physicians are also frequently involved in the treatment of fibromyalgia, including clinical psychologists, physical therapists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.' "
What is the treatment for fibromyalgia?,"'There are both medication and non-medication treatments for fibromyalgia. Medication treatments frequently help manage the pain and ''sleeplessness'' from which fibromyalgia patients suffer. However, the non-medication treatments are really the basis of treatment for fibromyalgia. The non-medication treatments for fibromyalgia include education, ''exercise'', and ''stress'' reduction. ''Sleep disorders'' may require both medication and non-medication treatments.''Education about fibromyalgia is very important. Often patients have suffered with symptoms for years, and simply knowing why they have pain can be a relief, as many patients become anxious not knowing what is causing their symptoms. Patients should also be educated about treatment approaches, good sleep hygiene, and the importance of treating conditions that may contribute to their symptoms. For example, when a patient with ''rheumatoid arthritis'' has fibromyalgia as well, poor control of their ''rheumatoid arthritis'' may lead to worsening of fibromyalgia pain and sleeplessness.''An exercise program is crucial in the treatment of fibromyalgia and should include stretching, strengthening, and ''aerobic exercise''. Many patients with fibromyalgia find it difficult to institute a regular exercise program because they feel they are too tired to exercise and they may perceive that their pain and fatigue worsen when they begin to exercise. However, numerous scientific studies have shown that exercise for fibromyalgia, especially aerobic exercise, can improve pain, physical function, and a sense of well-being. Starting slow and sticking with the exercise program is very important. Low-impact aerobic activities such as ''swimming'', water aerobics, ''walking'', and biking are activities that patients with fibromyalgia find helpful. Many patients find it helpful to exercise in the morning. Some patients find ''yoga'' helpful for strengthening and stretching. An aerobic exercise program should also accompany this.'""Stress reduction is important for the self-management of fibromyalgia symptoms. Many patients feel that their symptoms are triggered by stress. Stress reduction can be challenging. There are many stressors in life; some can be changed and others cannot. Stress reduction involves a combination of changing stressors that can be changed and learning to lessen the body's stress reaction to the stressors that cannot be changed.""'Cognitive behavioral therapy'' is a form of psychological therapy whereby a therapist and patient work together, to establish healthy patterns of behavior by replacing negative thoughts with more productive thoughts and actions. This has been proven to work in fibromyalgia. This form of therapy can be done one on one in an office setting, or even over the Internet.''The non-medication therapies are the cornerstone of treatment for fibromyalgia. With them, many people improve and may not require medications. Moreover, without focusing on sleep hygiene, stress reduction and exercise, it is difficult to improve, even with medication.''When used with non-medication therapies, medication treatments can help improve sleep, pain, and function in fibromyalgia. Administration of medications is most effective for pain relief when combined with ongoing non-medication treatments as discussed above. Medications often used in the treatment of fibromyalgia include medications in the ''antidepressant'' class (medications originally developed to treat ''anxiety'' and ''depression'') and anticonvulsants (medications originally developed to treat ''seizures'').''A few notes on other treatments for fibromyalgia: ''Acupuncture'' can be helpful for some patients with fibromyalgia but is not usually recommended as one of the first-line treatments for fibromyalgia because the scientific studies on ''acupuncture'' for fibromyalgia patients have not shown definite benefit. Likewise, trigger point injections help for some patients. Alternative medicines have not been proven to be helpful in fibromyalgia; in particular, scientific studies on ''guaifenesin'' (''Mucinex'') show that it does not work. Of note, patients with ''vitamin D deficiency'' can have widespread ''arthralgia'' and ''myalgia'', like fibromyalgia, which improves with ''vitamin D'' supplementation. While having a sufficient level of ''vitamin D'' is important to maintain bone health, a healthy immune system, and perhaps prevent certain types of ''cancer'', ''vitamin D'' supplementation does not improve fibromyalgia symptoms in patients who have sufficient levels of vitamin D. Narcotic pain medications should be avoided in fibromyalgia because they may worsen the underlying problem.'   Medications called ""tricyclic antidepressants"" have been used to treat fibromyalgia for many years. These medications include amitriptyline (Elavil), doxepin (Sinequan, Silenor), and desipramine (Norpramin). These medications are generally started in low doses and increased until adequate response is achieved. The advantage of these medications is that they are effective for sleep and pain, widely available, and less costly for most patients than some of the newer agents. Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) is a medication that is both a muscle relaxant and tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to help with sleep and pain in patients with fibromyalgia. Medications in the antidepressant class that affect the serotonin and the norepinephrine neurotransmitters (SNRI antidepressants) are frequently used in the treatment of fibromyalgia. These medications include duloxetine (Cymbalta), milnacipran (Savella), and venlafaxine (Effexor). Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter in the brain, and increasing the levels of norepinephrine with these medications decreases pain levels. Fluoxetine (Prozac) is an antidepressant that affects mainly serotonin at low doses but increases norepinephrine as well at higher doses. Higher doses of fluoxetine can be used to treat fibromyalgia pain. Pregabalin (Lyrica) and gabapentin (Neurontin) are anticonvulsants (medications initially developed to treat seizures). There are many scientific studies showing that pregabalin and gabapentin can be effective for fibromyalgia pain. Tramadol (Ultram) is an opioid pain reliever, which is helpful in some patients with fibromyalgia but should be used with caution as sometimes the use of opioids can worsen the pain cycle in fibromyalgia. Memantine (Namenda) is a medication commonly used for dementia. Preliminary studies show that memantine may be helpful with pain and other symptoms of fibromyalgia, but further studies are needed to confirm this. There have been small scientific studies of low-dose naltrexone (Revia, Vivitrol) in fibromyalgia. Naltrexone's main scientifically proven use is in treating narcotic addiction. In one small study, a very low dose of naltrexone was shown to benefit some patients with fibromyalgia. Further studies of low-dose naltrexone in fibromyalgia are needed to know if it really works."
Are there any home remedies for fibromyalgia?,"'The non-medication treatments for fibromyalgia are the cornerstone of treatment of the syndrome. These include lifestyle changes like education, stress reduction, improving sleep, and exercise.'  "
What is the prognosis of fibromyalgia?,"'The overall mortality is not increased in patients with fibromyalgia, and it is not an organ-threatening disease. However, many patients with fibromyalgia continue to suffer from long-term widespread pain. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, many fibromyalgia patients find their overall sense of well-being and their pain improves to pain levels that are more moderate\xa0 with the treatments discussed above. There are some patients who experience a dramatic reduction in pain with changes in their life to reduce stress. However, these patients are always at risk for worsening of their symptoms in the future and should maintain efforts for a healthy lifestyle, including sleep hygiene, ongoing exercise, and ''stress management''. Fibromyalgia patients have a higher rate of disability than the general population, but seeking permanent disability status is generally discouraged because it frequently leads to worsening of symptoms.' "
Is it possible to prevent fibromyalgia?,"'Fibromyalgia is a syndrome with a genetic predisposition. It can be triggered by certain events, but the exact events leading to the onset of fibromyalgia is unknown. Because of this, there is no known way to prevent fibromyalgia. However, leading a healthy lifestyle, including getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and exercising, is the best way to stay healthy.' "
Are there support groups for fibromyalgia?,"'Yes, there are support groups for fibromyalgia. Local support groups and further information can be found through the Arthritis Foundation (http://www.arthritis.org), National Fibromyalgia Association (http://www.fmaware.org), or the National Fibromyalgia Partnership, Inc. (http://www.fmpartnership.org).' "
What is the latest research on fibromyalgia?,"'There is ongoing medical research on fibromyalgia on many fronts. There is active research on the genes responsible for fibromyalgia, new medications, and new non-medication therapies to help pain. One recent study found that non-restorative sleep -- when one wakes up feeling tired after a full night of sleep -- is strongly tied to developing widespread pain. Medical researchers have linked ''anxiety'' to developing widespread pain.' "
What is fifth disease? What causes fifth disease?,"'Fifth disease is a viral illness caused by human parvovirus B19. ''Erythema infectiosum'' and ''slapped cheek syndrome'' are other names for fifth disease. Health care professionals first described fifth disease in 1896 and named the illness fifth disease because of its fifth position in the numerical classification of six ''childhood illnesses'' associated with ''rashes'' (exanthems). Other numbered viral exanthems included ''measles'' (''rubeola'' or first disease), ''rubella'' (''German measles'' or third disease), and ''roseola'' infantum (''sixth disease''). The bacterium ''Streptococcus'' pyogenes'' causes ''scarlet fever'', or ""second disease."" Doctors no longer classify fourth disease as a clinical entity. Health care providers did not rename these illnesses until the molecular era, when it became possible to isolate ''viruses'' and bacteria. Parvovirus infection is very common. Almost 50% of adults have had a parvovirus B19 infection but often do not remember having it because this infection frequently does not cause symptoms.'  "
What are fifth disease symptoms and signs in children and adults?,"'Fifth disease generally occurs in school-age children between 4-10 years of age, but it can affect any age group. Parvovirus infection most commonly occurs during the winter and spring. The illness classically begins with a low-grade ''fever'', ''headache'', ''runny nose'', ''sore throat'', and malaise (a sense of not feeling well). Of course, these ''cold-like symptoms'' mimic any other viral illness, so it is impossible to determine the cause early in the illness. After about a week, a characteristic bright red rash on the cheeks (the so-called ""slapped cheeks"") follows the initial symptoms. Finally, after three to four days, a fine, red, lace-like rash can develop over the rest of the body. This rash may last for five to seven days and occasionally comes and goes for several weeks. The other symptoms are usually gone by the time the rash appears. Patients with the rash are usually not ''contagious''. Unfortunately, as with many other viral illnesses, the features and timing of the different stages of illness are often unpredictable.''Unlike other viral infections that usually cause ''hand, foot, and mouth disease'' (namely coxsackievirus A16 and ''enterovirus'' 71), fifth disease does not typically involve the palms and soles. However, some adults infected with parvovirus B19 can develop redness and swelling of hands and ''feet''.'  "
Are there other symptoms that can occur with fifth disease?,"'Around 5% of children and about half of adults with fifth disease experience joint pains. This ''arthritis'' or arthropathy is more common in females than males, is usually temporary, lasting for a few days to weeks, and may become a long-term problem for months. People with arthritis from fifth disease usually have ''stiffness'' in the morning, with redness and swelling of the same joints on both sides of the body (""symmetrical"" arthritis). The joints most commonly involved are the knees, fingers, and wrists.' "
What are the serious complications of fifth disease? Is infection with fifth disease dangerous during pregnancy?,"'Rarely, these patients develop erythrocyte aplasia, meaning the bone marrow stops forming a normal number of ''red blood cells'' (''anemia''). This complication is rare and usually transient, but ''anemia'' can be life-threatening. Patients who have compromised immune systems (by disease or treatment) are at high risk of this complication.''Pregnant women (who have not previously had the illness) should avoid contact with patients who have fifth disease. The fifth disease virus can infect the fetus prior to birth. Although no ''birth defects'' have been reported because of fifth disease, for 2%-10% of B19-infected pregnant women, fifth disease can cause severe anemia and even the death of the unborn fetus (by hydrops fetalis). Blood tests for parvovirus B19 are not routinely included in preconception or antenatal screenings.' "
What is the treatment for fifth disease?,"'The only available treatment is supportive. Fluids, ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), and rest provide relief. Antibiotics are useless against fifth disease, because it is a viral illness. People with persistent arthritis can use anti-inflammatory medications such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') or ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), though children should not take ''aspirin'' due to the risk of developing Reye syndrome.'  "
"How does fifth disease spread? When is the contagious stage, and should I be isolatedif I have fifth disease?","'Parvovirus B19 usually spreads by droplets. The virus spreads whenever an infected person ''coughs'' or sneezes. However, once the rash is present, that person is usually no longer contagious and need not be isolated.' "
Is it possible to prevent the spread of fifth disease?,"'Similar to most viral illnesses, the best way to prevent the spread of the disease is by proper hand washing, by covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze or ''cough'', and by staying home when you become sick.' "
What is a tooth filling?,"'To treat a ''cavity'' your dentist will remove the decayed portion of the tooth and then ""fill"" the area on the tooth where the decayed material once lived.''Fillings are also used to repair cracked or broken ''teeth'' and ''teeth'' that have been worn down from misuse (such as from nail-biting or tooth grinding).' "
What steps are involved in filling a tooth?,"'First, the dentist will numb the area around the tooth with a local anesthetic. Next, a drill, air ''abrasion'"" instrument or laser will be used to remove the decayed area. The choice of instrument depends on the individual dentist's comfort level, training, and investment in the particular piece of equipment as well as location and extent of the decay.""'Next, your dentist will probe or test the area during the decay removal process to determine if all the decay has been removed. Once the decay has been removed, your dentist will prepare the space for the filling by cleaning the ''cavity'' of bacteria and debris. If the decay is near the root, your dentist may first put in a liner made of glass ionomer, composite resin, or other material to protect the nerve. Generally, after the filling is in, your dentist will finish and polish it.''Several additional steps are required for tooth-colored fillings and are as follows. After your dentist has removed the decay and cleaned the area, the tooth-colored material is applied in layers. Next, a special light that ""cures"" or hardens each layer is applied. When the multilayering process is completed, your dentist will shape the composite material to the desired result, trim off any excess material and polish the final restoration.' "
What types of filling materials are available?,"'Today, several dental filling materials are available. Teeth can be filled with gold; porcelain; silver amalgam (which consists of mercury mixed with silver, tin, zinc, and copper); or tooth-colored, ''plastic'"" and glass materials called composite resin fillings. The location and extent of the decay, cost of filling material, patients' insurance coverage and your dentist's recommendation assist in determining the type of filling that will best address your needs.""'In addition to tooth-colored, composite resin fillings, two other tooth-colored fillings exist -- ceramics and glass ionomer.'  Durability -- lasts at least 10 to 15 years, usually longer; doesn't corrode Strength -- can withstand chewing forces Aesthetics -- some patients find gold more pleasing to the eye than silver, amalgam fillings Expense -- more than other materials; up to 10 times higher than cost of amalgam filings Additional office visits -- requires at least two office visits to place Galvanic shock -- a gold filling placed immediately next to a silver, amalgam filling can cause a sharp pain (galvanic shock) to occur. The interaction between the metals and saliva causes an electric current to occur -- it's a rare occurrence, however Aesthetics -- most patients don't find any ""colored"" fillings to be an ""eye-pleasing"" advantage Durability -- lasts at least 10 to 15 years and usually outlasts composite fillings Strength -- can withstand chewing forces Expense -- is less expensive than composite fillings Poor aesthetics -- fillings don't match the color of your natural teeth Destruction of more tooth structure -- healthy parts of the tooth must often be removed to make a space large enough to hold the amalgam filling Discoloration -- amalgam fillings can create a grayish hue to the surrounding tooth structure Cracks and fractures -- although all teeth expand and contract in the presence of hot and cold liquids, which ultimately can cause the tooth to crack or fracture, amalgam material -- in comparison with other filling materials -- may experience a wider degree of expansion and contraction and lead to a higher incidence of cracks and fractures Allergic reactions -- a small percentage of people, approximately 1%, are allergic to the mercury present in amalgam restorations Aesthetics -- the shade/color of the composites can be closely matched to the color of existing teeth; is particularly well suited for use in front teeth or visible parts of teeth Bonding to tooth structure -- composite fillings actually chemically bond to tooth structure, providing further support to the tooth Versatility in uses -- in addition to use as a filling material for decay, composite fillings can also be used to repair chipped, broken or worn teeth Tooth-sparing preparation -- sometimes less tooth structure needs to be removed compared with amalgams when removing decay and preparing for the filling Lack of durability -- composite fillings wear out sooner than amalgams (lasting at least 5 years compared with at least 10 to 15 for amalgams); in addition, they may not last as long as amalgams under the pressure of chewing and particularly if used as the filling material for large cavities Increased chair time -- because of the process to apply the composite material, these fillings can take up to 20 minutes longer than amalgams to place Additional visits -- if composites are used for inlays or onlays, more than one office visit may be required Chipping -- depending on location, composite materials can chip off the tooth Expense -- composite fillings can cost up to twice the cost of amalgams Ceramics, which are made most often of porcelain, are more resistant to staining than composite resin material but are also more abrasive. This material generally lasts more than 15 years and can cost as much as gold. Glass ionomer is made of acrylic and a specific type of glass material. This material is most commonly used for fillings below the gum line and for fillings in young children (drilling is still required). Glass ionomers release fluoride, which can help protect the tooth from further decay. However, this material is weaker than composite resin and is more susceptible to wear and prone to fracture. Glass ionomer generally lasts 5 years or less with costs comparable to composite resin."
Does dental insurance cover the cost of composites?,"'Most dental insurance plans cover the cost of the composites up to the price of the silver filling, then the patient must pay the difference.' "
What are indirect fillings?,"'Indirect fillings are similar to composite or tooth-colored fillings except that they are made in a dental laboratory and require two visits before being placed. Indirect fillings are considered when not enough tooth structure remains to support a filling but the tooth is not so severely damaged that it needs a ''crown''.''During the first visit, decay or an old filling is removed. An impression is taken to record the shape of the tooth being repaired and the teeth around it. The impression is sent to a dental laboratory that will make the indirect filling. A temporary filling (described below) is placed to protect the tooth while your restoration is being made. During the second visit, the temporary filling is removed, and the dentist will check the fit of the indirect restoration. Provided the fit is acceptable, it will be permanently cemented into place.''There are two types of indirect fillings -- inlays and onlays.''Inlays and onlays are more durable and last much longer than traditional fillings -- up to 30 years. They can be made of tooth-colored composite resin, porcelain or gold. Inlays and onlays weaken the tooth structure, but do so to a much lower extent than traditional fillings.''Another type of inlay and onlay -- direct inlays and onlays -- follow the same processes and procedures as the indirect; the difference is that direct inlays and onlays are made in the dental office and can be placed in one visit. The type of inlay or onlay used depends on how much sound tooth structure remains and consideration of any cosmetic concerns.' Inlays are similar to fillings but the entire work lies within the cusps (bumps) on the chewing surface of the tooth. Onlays are more extensive than inlays, covering one or more cusps. Onlays are sometimes called partial crowns."
What is a temporary filling and why would I need one?,"'Temporary fillings are used under the following circumstances:'""Temporary fillings are just that; they are not meant to last. They usually fall out, fracture, or wear out within 1 month. Be sure to contact your dentist to have your temporary filling replaced with a permanent one. If you don't, your tooth could become infected or you could have other complications."" For fillings that require more than one appointment -- for example, before placement of gold fillings and for certain filling procedures (called indirect fillings) that use composite materials Following a root canal To allow a tooth's nerve to ""settle down"" if the pulp became irritated If emergency dental treatment is needed (such as to address a toothache)"
Are amalgam-type fillings safe?,"'Over the past several years, concerns have been raised about silver-colored fillings, otherwise called amalgams. Because amalgams contain the toxic substance mercury, some people think that amalgams are responsible for causing a number of diseases, including ''autism'', '""Alzheimer's""' disease, and ''multiple sclerosis''.''The American Dental Association (ADA), the FDA, and numerous public health agencies say amalgams are safe, and that any link between mercury-based fillings and disease is unfounded. The causes of ''autism'', '""Alzheimer's""' disease, and ''multiple sclerosis'' remain unknown. Additionally, there is no solid, scientific evidence to back up the claim that if a person has amalgam fillings removed, he or she will be cured of these or any other diseases.''In March of 2002, the FDA reconfirmed the safety of amalgams. Although amalgams do contain mercury, when they are mixed with other metals, such as silver, copper, tin, and zinc, they form a stable alloy that dentists have used for more than 100 years to fill and preserve hundreds of millions of decayed teeth. The National Institutes of Health published several large-scale studies\xa0to answer many of the questions raised about silver-colored amalgams. Results of these studies were released in 2006.''In addition, there has been concern over the release of a small amount of mercury vapor from these fillings, but according to the ADA, there is no scientific evidence that this small amount results in adverse health effects.'

How should I care for my teeth with fillings?,"'To maintain your fillings, you should follow good oral hygiene practices -- visiting your dentist regularly for cleanings, brushing with a fluoride-containing ''toothpaste'', and flossing at least once daily. If your dentist suspects that a filling might be cracked or is ""leaking"" (when the sides of the filling don\'t fit tightly against the tooth, this allows debris and saliva to seep down between the filling and the tooth, which can lead to decay), he or she will take ''X-rays'' to assess the situation. If your tooth is extremely sensitive, if you feel a sharp edge, if you notice a crack in the filling, or if a piece of the filling is missing, call your dentist for an appointment.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Edited by Charlotte E. Grayson, MD, February 2003, WebMD.''Portions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic'' 2000-2003' "
Introduction,"'As you and your family evaluate your long-term care needs for dealing with '""Alzheimer's""' disease, it is important to consider financing options including health coverage, Medicare, and Medicaid. Long-term financial planning is important for everyone -- but is essential if you are coping with the expense of a long-term illness, such as '""Alzheimer's"""" disease. Many people pay careful attention to their health after they are diagnosed with Alzheimer's. They research their treatment plan, take their medications on schedule, and consult with their physician regularly. However, it may take some time for patients and caregivers to realize that a progressive illness like Alzheimer's can have a tremendous effect on their financial well-being.""""This article offers some basic information on how to handle your finances while living with Alzheimer's disease."" "
Developing a Plan,"""Alzheimer's disease gets worse over time, and dealing with a progressive illness is difficult. There is no way to know how you will feel or what you will be able to do days, months, or years from now. But for your own security and that of your family, you need to plan ahead, knowing that Alzheimer's disease will lead to increasing disability. There are professional financial managers and medical lawyers who deal with financial planning for people with long-term or progressive illnesses. Ask your doctor for a referral, or speak with a national association or support group to find a reputable professional in this area."" "
Medical Coverage," If you are insured, either through your employer or a retirement policy, 
read all of the policies pertaining to long-term/progressive illnesses. If you 
are unsure about the language or terminology, contact the personnel department 
or your financial planner. If you are unemployed and you do not have coverage, you should look for the 
highest level of coverage that you can afford. The Alzheimer's Association may 
be able to give you a list of insurers with a high level of Alzheimer's 
coverage. If you are 65 or over, you qualify for Medicare. You can supplement this 
insurance with a ""Medigap"" 
policy available through a private insurer. Note also that many states have 
prescription assistance/reimbursement programs for low-income senior 
citizens. If you are disabled but too young to qualify for Social Security, you may 
be eligible to receive a form of Medicare for the disabled. If you cannot get insurance and your income is low, you may qualify for 
Medicaid, a government ""safety net"" program that pays for medical costs that 
exceed a person's ability to pay."
Investigate Long- and Short-term Disability Insurance,"'Check to see if your employer has private disability insurance, and contact your human resources department to investigate your eligibility, the cost of enrolling, and how much of your salary it will cover.''Medicare and Medicaid' If you are unable to continue working. If you are too young to qualify for Social Security, you should consider 
state-run disability programs, unless you are enrolled in your employer's 
disability coverage. If your total income is below a certain level, you may qualify for 
federally subsidized Supplemental Security Income (SSI). If you collect SSI, 
regardless of your age, you are a candidate for Medicaid."
What Is Medicare?,"'Medicare is a federal health insurance program providing health care benefits to all Americans age 65 and over, as well as some disabled individuals under age 65. Eligibility for Medicare is linked to Social Security and railroad retirement benefits.''Medicare has co-payments and deductibles. A deductible is an initial amount you are responsible for paying before Medicare coverage begins. A co-payment is a percentage of the amount of covered expense you are required to pay.' "
What Are Medicare's Coverage Options?,"'Medicare has two parts:''Part A Medicare coverage includes:''Part B Medicare coverage includes:''Part B Medicare benefits require that you pay a monthly premium. You must also be entitled to Part A benefits to receive Part B benefits.' Part A (hospital insurance) Part B (medical insurance) All normal hospital services. Skilled nursing facility care. Home health services, including a visiting nurse or a physical, 
occupational, or speech 
therapist. Medical supplies. Hospice services. Eighty percent of reasonable charges from doctors and other health care 
professionals (after the annual deductible is met). Medically necessary ambulance services. Physical, speech, and occupational therapy. Home health care services (physician certification is necessary). Medical supplies and equipment. Transfusion of blood and blood components provided on an outpatient 
basis. Outpatient surgery."
Medicare Coverage of Skilled Nursing Care Facilities,"'In order to receive care in a nursing home under Medicare:' You must have had a three-day hospital stay prior to admission into the 
skilled nursing facility. You must be admitted into the skilled nursing facility within 30 days of 
discharge from the hospital. You must enter the skilled nursing facility for treatment of the same 
condition for which you were hospitalized. You must require daily skilled care. The condition must be one that can be improved by admission to the 
facility. The facility must be Medicare-certified. Your physician must write a care plan. The care plan must be carried out by 
the skilled nursing facility. (Once the patient meets the level of functioning 
laid out in the care plan, Medicare will no longer pay for services.)"
Medicare Coverage of Home Care,"'In order to receive home care under Medicare:' The patient must be homebound. The physician must certify a plan of care. Care must be needed on a non-continuous basis. Care cannot exceed 35 hours per week or 8 hours per day. Physical or speech 
therapy must be provided on a ""necessary and reasonable"" basis. There are no 
restrictions on the number of days or hours per week of these therapies. If a person qualifies for home health care, he or she is entitled to a home 
health aide to provide some personal care."
What Is Medicaid?,"'Medicaid is a joint federal-state health insurance program providing medical assistance primarily to low-income Americans. It also is available to people under 65 if they are blind or disabled.''The purpose of Medicaid is to provide preventive, therapeutic, and rehabilitative health services and supplies that are essential to attain an optimum level of well-being.' "
How Do People Receive Medicaid Benefits?,"'There are two ways to receive Medicaid:' Through Supplemental Security Income (SSI) -- People who receive a cash 
grant under SSI and Aid to Dependent Children are automatically eligible for 
Medicaid benefits. Medicaid spend down -- This is similar to a deductible or a co-payment 
that you must pay every month. Once you meet your ""spend down"" amount, you are 
eligible for Medicaid for the remainder of the month."
Who Is Eligible for Medicaid?,"'Medicaid eligibility requirements depend on financial need, low income, and low assets. In determining Medicaid eligibility, officials do not review rent, car payments, or food costs. They only review medical expenses. Medical expenses include:' Care from hospitals, doctors, clinics, nurses, dentists, podiatrists and 
chiropractors. Medications. Medical supplies and equipment. Health insurance premiums. Transportation to get medical care."
Medicaid Coverage,"""Medicaid coverage varies from state to state. For specific coverage guidelines, contact your state's Department of Human Services. Generally, Medicaid benefits include:""'Transportation''Ambulatory Centers''Hospital Services''Home Health Care''Skilled Nursing Facilities''For More Information:''U.S. Department of Health and Human Services'' Health Care Financing Administration'' 6325 Security Blvd.''Baltimore, MD 21207''(410) 786-3000''WebMD Medical Reference' Ambulance services when other means of transportation are detrimental to 
the patient's health. Transportation to and from the hospital at time of admission or discharge 
when required by the patient's condition. Transportation to and from a hospital, outpatient clinic, doctor's office, 
or other facility when the doctor certifies the need for this service. Ambulatory health care centers are often private corporations or public 
agencies that are not part of a hospital. They provide preventive, diagnostic, 
therapeutic, and rehabilitative services under the direction of a doctor. 
Ambulatory services covered by Medicaid include dental, pharmaceutical, 
diagnostic, and vision care. Inpatient hospital care. Private hospital rooms only when the illness requires the patient to be 
isolated for his or her own health or the health of others. Outpatient preventive, therapeutic, and rehabilitative services. Professional and technical laboratory and radiological services.

short-term care for a patient whose condition is stable or reversible) are 
covered through Medicaid with a physician's authorization."
What is a breast biopsy?,"'A breast biopsy is a procedure in which part or all of a suspicious area in the breast is removed and examined, usually for the presence of ''breast cancer''. The growth sample is suctioned out through a needle or cut out using a surgical procedure. A pathologist then examines and evaluates it under a microscope to identify noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (''malignant'') tissue.''Words used to refer to the abnormal area or growth before and after diagnosis may include lump, mass, lesion, calcification, and ''tumor''.''Imaging studies such as ''mammography'', ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI), or ultrasound may be used to guide the procedure, known as an image-guided breast biopsy. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses a special mammography machine to help guide the biopsy equipment to the site of the breast abnormality.''The following are the different types of breast biopsy procedures:'   Fine-needle aspiration (FNA): A thin needle suctions out cells from an abnormal area; a physician examines the cells to see if cancer cells are present. Hollow or core needle biopsy: This thicker needle is used to remove a small cylinder of tissue from the abnormal area. Biopsy with a vacuum-powered device Surgical excision of tissue: This may be an excisional biopsy, in which all the abnormal area is excised or removed, or an incisional biopsy, which removes only a portion of the abnormal area for examination by the pathologist."
What is the purpose of a breast biopsy?,"'The breast biopsy is used to determine whether or not a worrisome abnormality or area of calcification is ''cancer'' and, if it is ''cancer'', what type it is and how to develop a treatment plan. When no ''breast cancer'' is detected, the diagnosis of a benign or harmless lump is reassuring. The percentage of breast biopsies that are positive for cancer varies according to the individual hospital or clinic, but in general, only about 20% of ''breast lumps'' are cancerous. The majority of breast biopsies do not detect cancer.' "
"What specialties of physicians and 
other health care professionals perform breast biopsies?","'Many physicians and health care professionals can be involved in evaluating a woman for a breast biopsy.' For example, breast abnormalities during a physical examination might be noticed by a family physician, internist, gynecologist, or nurse practitioner. Women themselves are frequently the first to detect abnormalities in their breasts. Radiologists are specialists in interpreting X-rays such as mammograms, as well as other imaging studies. Radiologists or surgeons often perform the procedure to obtain these breast tissue samples. Anesthesiologists (specialists in administering anesthesia and monitoring a patient's vital signs) are sometimes necessary during some surgical procedures. Pathologists are physician specialists who examine and identify under a microscope the type of cells in the samples and determine whether or not cancer is present."
Who should have a breast biopsy?,"'Anyone, female or male, with a suspicious breast growth, abnormality detected on imaging study, or other ''symptoms of breast cancer'' should undergo a biopsy. Ninety-nine percent of all breast ''cancers'' occur in females, however, males can and do get breast cancer. Therefore, men should regularly examine their breasts as females do for lumps or other ''cancer symptoms''. (Males with the ''genetic disorder'' ''Klinefelter syndrome'', which is associated with increased breast development, have approximately the same risk of developing breast cancer as females.)'  "
In what setting is the breast biopsy done?,"""Breast biopsies are performed in the doctor's office, an outpatient facility, or a hospital operating room. The setting depends on the size and location of the growth, the patient's general health, and the type of biopsy performed. Because physicians can perform biopsies in a short time with minimal risk of serious complications, the patient usually does not need to remain hospitalized overnight unless an underlying health problem requires close monitoring. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses mammography images to guide the location of the biopsy. Ultrasound or MRI imaging may also be used to guide the breast biopsy procedure."" "
What may a benign result indicate?,"'Among the most common benign growths in the breast are ''cysts'' (sacs filled with fluid or semisolid material), intraductal papillomas (small wart-like growths that project above a tissue surface), and lumps formed by fat necrosis (the death of tissue often as a result of ''trauma'' to the breast). A fibroadenoma is the most common type of benign (noncancerous) breast tumor and is found in young women.' "
How is a suspicious breast growth discovered?,"""A suspicious breast growth may be found by a patient's self-examination, a physician's clinical examination, or a screening procedure such as a ""'mammogram''. Small calcium deposits, known as calcifications, are often identified in imaging studies of breast cancers and precancers. These may also be present in benign lesions.' "
What breast symptoms should I be concerned about?,"'Females and males (regardless of age) who discover a lump in a breast should see a doctor for testing. They also should see a doctor if they find a lump in an armpit or above a collarbone (either of which could indicate the presence of spreading cancer).''A doctor or health care professional should be consulted if a person has''It is important to remember that these signs and symptoms do not necessarily indicate the presence of cancer.' red or irritated breast skin, scaly skin on the breast, dimpling skin on the breast, swelling breast skin, nipple discharge other than milk, nipple retraction or inversion, nipple itching, a change in the size or shape of a breast, or breast pain."
What should the patient tell the doctor about the growth?,"'The patient should tell the health care professional when the growth appeared, what its size was at the time of discovery compared to its present size, and where it is located. The patient should also outline any family history of breast cancer, as well as any personal history of breast problems of any kind.' "
How does a health care professional confirm the presence of a breast growth?,"'A physician confirms the presence of a growth by taking a medical history (and asking numerous questions), performing a clinical examination that includes palpating (feeling) the breast, and interpreting the results of a diagnostic mammogram and sometimes other imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI.''Ultrasound sends sound waves into the breast that bounce back to a receiver that can record an image on a computer screen to visualize interior structures. This technique can help distinguish between a ''cyst'' and a solid growth. The physician may also order the laboratory analysis of any nipple discharge (other than milk) to examine for the presence of atypical or cancer cells. After confirming the presence of a suspicious growth or mass, the physician orders a biopsy.' "
"Is anesthesia needed for a 
breast biopsy?","'For nonsurgical biopsies, the patient may need no anesthesia at all or just a local anesthetic (one that numbs the suspicious area only). Sometimes, a patient receives a sedative (calming drug) with the local anesthesia.''For surgical biopsies, the patient may receive a local anesthetic (with or without a sedative) or general anesthesia (one that induces ''sleep''). Patients requiring general anesthesia may have to fast eight to 12 hours before undergoing a biopsy.' "
What are the possible complications from a breast biopsy?,"'Except for a minor sting from the injected anesthesia, patients usually feel no ''pain'' before or during a procedure.''The risk of complications, such as infection and bleeding, is small for nonsurgical procedures and slightly higher for surgical procedures.' "
How long is the recovery time after breast biopsy?,"'After a procedure, some patients may experience some soreness and ''pain'' as well as ''bruising'' and minor skin discoloration of the breast that usually resolves within a week or so. Usually, an ''over-the-counter'' drug such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is sufficient to alleviate any discomfort.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of nonsurgical procedures versus surgical breast biopsies?,"'Generally, nonsurgical biopsies are less stressful, do not disfigure the skin, leave no internal ''scar'' to interfere with the accuracy of future mammograms, and minimize the risk of complications.''However, nonsurgical biopsies are not always as reliable as surgical biopsies in producing a diagnosis, and the results at times may be inconclusive. For this reason, some patients who undergo a nonsurgical biopsy must also undergo a follow-up surgical biopsy.' "
What are the different types of breast biopsy procedures and what do they involve?,"'Breast biopsy procedures include''These procedures are described in greater detail later in this article.'   fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and surgical biopsy."
How is a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) done?,"'A fine needle aspiration biopsy can be done in several different ways:''By analyzing the samples immediately after their withdrawal, a doctor may be able to determine that they came from a cyst and simply discard them, diagnosing the growth as benign. In all other cases, fluid and tissue samples are placed on slides and then analyzed by a pathologist in a laboratory. Atypical cells found in a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may signal that cancer is present or that repeat biopsies are necessary.' Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for palpable growths: A palpable growth is one that can be felt. The patient usually sits up while the doctor inserts a small hollow needle with a syringe to withdraw (aspirate) fluid and cells from the growth for testing. The doctor simply feels (palpates) the suspicious area to the needle to the site. When the needle reaches the mass, the doctor suctions out a sample with the syringe. The doctor repeats this procedure several times. If the mass is a cyst, the withdrawn samples will consist mainly of fluid and the cyst may collapse, relieving any pain the patient feels. If the mass is solid, the samples will consist primarily of tissue cells. Guided FNA for non-palpable growths: When a growth is too small or deep to palpate (feel), the doctor must locate it with one of several imaging techniques. First, the patient lies face-down on a table with the breasts suspended through an opening. With stereotactic mammography, mammograms of the suspicious breast site are taken from different angles to form a virtual three-dimensional (stereotactic) image that precisely pinpoints the location of the suspicious area. The computer then uses a motor to guide a small hollow needle to the site to remove the samples. The withdrawn samples are then analyzed for the presence of cancer. Ultrasound and MRI are other imaging techniques that may be used to guide breast biopsies."
How is a core needle biopsy done?,"'A core needle biopsy can also be done in several different ways:' Core needle biopsy for palpable growths: This procedure is similar to FNA for palpable growths except that that the needle used has a wider diameter and is equipped with a cutter that removes cores of tissue up to a ½ inch long. A key advantage of this procedure is that the samples are larger than in FNA and thus enhance the possibility of making an accurate laboratory analysis. Guided core needle biopsy for non-palpable growths: This procedure also uses a wide needle with a cutter that removes cores of tissue large enough to enhance the accuracy of laboratory analysis. However, because the growth is deep in the breast or otherwise not palpable, stereotactic imaging, ultrasound, or MRI is used to locate the growth."
How is a vacuum-assisted breast biopsy done?,"'Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy is procedure that uses a special instrument and imaging guidance to remove breast tissue samples through a single small skin incision. This technique allows the surgeon to remove more tissue through a single incision than is possible with a traditional core biopsy and is a much less invasive procedure than an open surgical biopsy.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy involves the placement of a biopsy probe using radiology imaging studies for guidance. Stereotactic mammography, ultrasound, and MRI have all been successfully used to identify the abnormal areas to be sampled by vacuum-assisted breast biopsy. Once the biopsy probe has been positioned, a vacuum pulls the breast tissue through an opening in the probe into the sampling chamber of the device. Then a rotating cutting device in the instrument removes the tissue sample, which is carried through the biopsy probe to a tissue collection receptacle.''The surgeon or radiologist then turns a control knob on the biopsy probe that moves the sampling chamber to a new position. This procedure is repeated until all desired areas have been sampled. In this way, samples can be taken all around a suspicious area through a single insertion of the biopsy probe. With a traditional core biopsy, sampling of multiple areas would involve repeated insertions of the biopsy instrument.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy procedure is performed under local anesthesia and leaves a small incision that does not require ''stitches'' for closure. It takes less than an hour to perform, and patients can usually return to normal activities soon after the procedure.' "
"How is a 
surgical biopsy of the breast done?","'A surgical biopsy can be an excisional (removing the entire abnormal area) or an incisional (removing only part of the abnormal area) biopsy. The surgical biopsy can be done in different ways:''The doctor closes the opening with ''sutures'' or clips that remain in place for about a week. Patients who receive general anesthesia rather than a local will require about an hour to recover from drowsiness after the surgery.' Surgical biopsy of palpable growths (lumpectomy): This procedure removes part or all of a breast growth, or lump. The doctor makes an incision 1 or 2 inches (about 2.5 to 5 cm) across and removes the sample. If the lump is small and measures 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less across, the doctor usually removes the entire lump for testing (excisional biopsy). If the lump is large, the doctor usually removes only a portion of it for testing (incisional biopsy). If cancer is found, the rest of the lump can be removed at the time of the biopsy or at a later time. Surgical biopsy for non-palpable lumps: This procedure is similar to lumpectomy except that the growth is first located by mammography or other imaging studies and then ""marked."" The doctor inserts a needle that conveys a wire with a hook on the end into the breast, all the while using the image as a guide. After anchoring the hooked wire to the lump, the doctor withdraws the needle and performs the surgery. Another option is to inject a dye to mark the spot rather than using a hooked wire."
What is the time frame for receiving the results of a breast biopsy?,"'For small biopsies and fine-needle aspirations, the results may be available the next day. The results of most breast biopsies will be available within a few days. Sometimes special testing must be performed, and the results may be delayed and take longer. This does not necessarily mean that a cancer is present. For example, sometimes the tissue sections must be recut to reveal deeper layers of the tissue to allow for optimal evaluation by the pathologist. In other cases, special tissue stains may be necessary to help the pathologist assess the tissue sample under the microscope. The radiologist or surgeon performing the procedure will be able to give you a better idea of the approximate time frame and how the result will be communicated to you.' "
What are thyroid nodules?,"'The thyroid gland is found in the neck just below the ""Adam\'s apple."" This gland is responsible for producing ''thyroid hormone'', which is an important hormone that stimulates the metabolism of the body.  ''Thyroid nodules'' are so common that up to half of all people have one, without any symptoms or effect. Like many things, the thyroid gland gets ""lumpier"" as we get older and the frequency of these nodules increases with age. In fact, many are found incidentally during routine examinations or radiology testing. Thyroid nodules are also more common in women than in men. Interestingly, because women have so many more nodules than men, the incidence of detected ''cancer'' is higher in women than in men by virtue of absolute numbers. However, each individual nodule is more likely to be cancerous if found in a man.''Doctors always hold a degree of concern whenever a new growth is detected on the body, regardless of the tissue involved. The concern is whether or not the growth or nodule is ''cancer''. Fortunately, fewer than 10% of thyroid nodules are malignant. The majority of thyroid nodules are harmless growths, known as adenomas, and are contained within a capsule. Even though cancerous nodules are uncommon, the doctor will take the necessary  measures to be certain.' "
What is the initial assessment of a thyroid nodule?,"'All patients with a thyroid nodule should undergo a complete medical history and physical examination. Specific questions regarding the onset of the nodule, related ''pain'' or discomfort, symptoms of ''thyroid disease'"", and family history are addressed. In addition, the doctor will take into account the patient's age and sex when evaluating the possibility of ""'malignancy'"". Patients with a history of head and neck radiation (which was commonly used in the 1950's as an ""'acne''\xa0treatment) are at a higher risk. Cancerous nodules are also more frequent in men as compared to women. The doctor will also look for general symptoms of thyroid disease in addition to other illnesses. The size and characteristics of the nodule are assessed. Is it soft or firm? Does it move with swallowing, or is it fixed? Is there more than one nodule? Are there other nodes involved? Does it hurt when the nodule is touched? The answers to these questions will help the doctor evaluate what further investigations, if any, are necessary.''The following is a list of factors that increase the suspicion of malignancy:''Nodules are less concerning to a physician if it is one of many present in the gland, and also if the nodule is hyperfunctioning (or ""hot"") using nuclear thyroid imaging.''After the initial evaluation, the doctor may choose to order ''thyroid blood tests'' or imaging scans to determine the functional activity of a thyroid nodule and its anatomy. The cornerstone in the assessment of a solitary thyroid nodule is a procedure known as fine needle aspiration biopsy (""FNAB"") of the thyroid gland.' Age: Patients less than 30 years of age and greater than 60 years of age have a higher risk of cancer in a thyroid nodule as do children; Associated symptoms such as difficulty swallowing or hoarseness; History of head and neck irradiation; A hard, fixed nodule on examination; Surrounding enlarged lymph nodes; and Previous history of thyroid cancer in the family."
Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the thyroid gland; why is it done?,"'A biopsy to obtain tissue for analysis is the best technique for detecting or ruling out the presence of cancer. For many years, a core biopsy of the thyroid was the procedure of choice. This method involved a large biopsy, which was often more difficult for patients. fine needle aspiration biopsy has now become the method of choice for obtaining samples of thyroid tissue. The procedure is technically quite simple. When performed properly, the testing  has a false negative rate of less than 5%. This means that a positive finding, such as cancer, will be missed fewer than five times out of 100.''The fine needle aspiration is also performed to treat thyroid cysts. A ''thyroid cyst'' is a fluid-filled sac within the thyroid gland. Aspiration of the ''cyst'' with a needle and syringe can shrink the swelling from the ''cyst'' and the fluid removed can be analyzed for cancer.'  "
Should fine needle aspiration biopsy be done on all thyroid nodules?,"'There are certain situations in which your physician may elect not to perform a biopsy of a nodule. For example, in a patient with an over- active thyroid (''hyperthyroidism''), the chance for a nodule to be cancerous is significantly less, particularly if other studies (such as nuclear thyroid imaging) show that the nodule is producing thyroid hormone (a ""hot"" nodule).''A doctor may recommend fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid in the following situations:' To make a diagnosis of a thyroid nodule; To help select therapy for a thyroid nodule; To drain a cyst that may be causing pain; or To inject a medication to shrink a recurrent cyst."
How is fine needle aspiration biopsy performed?,"'In most cases, if the nodule can be felt, a biopsy can be performed in the doctors office. In some cases an ''ultrasound'' may be needed to help guide the biopsy, (for example, if the nodule cannot be felt without difficulty or if the nodule has areas within it that specifically should be biopsied).''Little preparation by the patient is required. There is no need to fast or to withhold medications on the day of the biopsy. Occasionally, though, a patient may be asked not to take blood thinning medication either before or on the day of the biopsy. After an examination to pinpoint the nodule, the patient is asked to lie down and the neck is exposed. Depending on the location of the nodule and the type of clothes the patient is wearing, he or she may be asked to change into a gown. The doctor drapes the area around the neck and cleans the neck off. This is usually done with ''iodine'', which is a brown liquid that sterilizes the skin. Some doctors may choose to inject a local anesthetic. Often, the injection of the anesthetic results in an initial discomfort, like a ''bee sting''. The majority of doctors who regularly perform fine needle aspiration biopsies of the thyroid do not use a local anesthetic for this reason. Since the needle used for fine needle aspiration biopsy is so fine, anesthesia often results in simply another uncomfortable poke for the patient. If a patient is particularly concerned and nervous, a topical anesthetic preparation may be applied, which takes 10 to 20 minutes to work, thus prolonging the procedure. A patient undergoing fine needle aspiration biopsy should discuss any preferences for local anesthetic before the procedure begins. Most patients undergoing fine needle aspiration biopsy forego the use of any anesthetic and do very well.''Once the patient is ready, a small, fine-gauge needle is inserted into the nodule. The needle is smaller in diameter than the needle used in most blood draws (usually a 25 gauge 1.5 inch needle). The patient holds his breath while the needle is rocked gently to obtain as much tissue as possible. (The reason for holding the breath is to minimize movement of the structures in the neck.) The needle is then withdrawn and pressure is applied over the thyroid area to minimize bleeding. This procedure is usually repeated four to six times to ensure that an adequate amount of tissue has been collected. After the procedure, pressure is applied over the neck area for 5 to 10 minutes to assure that the bleeding has stopped. The pressure also helps to reduce any swelling that may occur. The entire procedure usually takes less than 20 minutes.' "
What are the complications of fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid?,"'Most patients notice very little bleeding or swelling. There may be some discomfort in the area for a few hours after the biopsy, which is usually relieved with ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''). Some patients like to put an ice pack over the area when they get home, but most do well without such measures. The risks of  fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid include bleeding, infection, and cyst formation, but these complications are exceedingly rare. Patients should contact their doctor if they notice any excessive ''bruising'' or swelling in the area of the biopsy, if they have persistent pain in the area, or if they develop a ''fever''.'  "
What happens to the thyroid tissue obtained at the fine needle aspiration biopsy?,"""After the procedure, the tissue obtained is prepared onto glass slides and sent to the pathologist for evaluation. First, the pathologist determines whether or not enough thyroid tissue has been obtained for analysis. (When there is an insufficient amount, a repeat fine needle aspiration biopsy is necessary.) After analysis, the tissue is classified. Although the classifications used by pathologists vary, the tissue is usually reported as (1) benign; (2) malignant; (3) suspicious; or (4) indeterminate. The chance of a false negative test (a test report that is negative when cancer is actually present) varies from 0-5%, depending on where the test is performed. The chance of a false positive (a test report showing cancer when there is no cancer present) is less than 5% and is usually due to the presence of degenerating cells or atypical cells. These results are reported back to the doctor's office, usually within one week. At this point, the doctor discusses the implications of the report and outlines further treatment, if needed based on the results.""  "
Summary,"""A fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid gland is an effective method to determine whether or not a thyroid nodule is cancer. The procedure is  relatively simple procedure that is usually performed in a doctor's office and usually takes less than 20 minutes. Complications are rare but include bleeding, bruising, and infection. Results are generally available within one week and help determine what further interventions or treatments are needed."" "
What are the symptoms of a broken finger? How will I know if it's broken?,"'The main symptoms of a broken finger are pain immediately after the trauma, and sometimes a deformed finger.'   A true fracture usually will be painful, but a broken finger may still have some range of motion and dull pain, and the individual may still be able to move it. Depending on the fracture stability, some fractures may be more painful than others may. Usually within 5-10 minutes, swelling and bruising of the finger will occur and the finger will stiffen. Swelling may affect the adjacent fingers as well. Numbness of the finger may occur either from the trauma of the injury itself, or because swelling compresses the nerves in the fingers. Fractures to the finger tip (distal phalanx) are common from smashing injuries to the fingernail. The symptoms of this type of injury may be swelling and bruising to the finger pad and purple-colored blood underneath the fingernail (subungual hematoma). If the trauma is severe, broken bones may be exposed (called a compound fracture)."
How common are broken fingers?,"'Fingers are easily injured, and broken fingers are some of the most common traumatic injuries seen in an emergency room. Fractures of the finger bones (phalanxes) and the bones in the palm of the hand (metacarpal bones) are the most common fractures, accounting for 10% of all fractures. Because fingers are used for many everyday activities, they are at higher risk than other parts of the body for traumatic injury, including sports injuries, workplace injuries, and other accidents.''Understanding the basic anatomy of the hand and fingers is useful in understanding different types of finger injuries, broken fingers, and how some treatments differ from others.''The hand is divided into three sections: 1) wrist, 2) palm, and 3) fingers.'   The wrist has eight bones, which move together to allow the vast ranges of motion of the wrist. The palm or mid-hand is comprised of the metacarpal bones. The metacarpal bones have muscular attachments and bridge the wrist to the individual fingers. These bones frequently are injured with direct trauma such as a crush injury, or most commonly, a punching injury. The fingers are the most frequently injured part of the hand. Fingers are constructed of ligaments (strong supportive tissue connecting bone to bone), tendons (attachment tissue from muscle to bone), and three phalanxes (bones). There are no muscles in the fingers; and fingers move by the pull of forearm muscles on the tendons. The three bones in each finger are named according to their relationship to the palm of the hand. The first bone, closest to the palm, is the  proximal phalanx; the second bone is the middle phalanx; and the smallest and farthest from the hand is the  distal phalanx. The thumb does not have a middle phalanx. The knuckles are joints formed by the bones of the fingers and are commonly injured or dislocated with trauma to the hand.The first and largest knuckle is the junction between the hand and the fingers - the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP). This joint commonly is injured in closed-fist activities and is commonly known as a boxer's fracture.The next knuckle out toward the fingernail is the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP). This joint may be dislocated in sporting events when a ball or object directly strikes the finger.The farthest joint of the finger is the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP). Injuries to this joint usually involve a fracture or torn tendon (avulsion) injury. The first and largest knuckle is the junction between the hand and the fingers - the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP). This joint commonly is injured in closed-fist activities and is commonly known as a boxer's fracture. The next knuckle out toward the fingernail is the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP). This joint may be dislocated in sporting events when a ball or object directly strikes the finger. The farthest joint of the finger is the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP). Injuries to this joint usually involve a fracture or torn tendon (avulsion) injury."
What causes broken fingers?,"'Traumatic injury is the main cause of broken fingers. Most commonly, traumatic injury to the finger occurs from playing sports, workplace injuries, falls, or other accidents.' "
When should I see a doctor for a broken finger?," After injury, if pain or swelling limits the motion or use of the fingers, or if the finger becomes numb, seek medical care. If the injury to the finger includes a laceration, crushed tissue, or exposure of bone, the individual should go to an emergency department for immediate medical care. Some fractures of the fingers may be subtle and the pain may be tolerable, so if a person suspects that they may have a finger fracture, seek medical attention."
How do doctors diagnose a broken finger?,"'X-ray is the primary tool used to diagnose a broken finger. The doctor will need an X-ray to evaluate the position of the broken finger bones.''With more complex injuries, the doctor may seek the advice of an orthopedic (bone and joint specialist) or hand surgeon (an orthopedic surgeon or ''plastic surgeon'' with post-residency, fellowship level training in ''hand surgery'').'  "
What is the treatment for a broken finger?,"'Broken fingers should be treated by medical professionals; however, a person can minimize some pain and stabilize the injury on the way to seek medical treatment.''The doctor will assess the stability of the broken finger. The treatment for a broken finger depends on the type of fracture, and the particular bone in the finger that is injured.''If the fracture is stable (not likely to worsen or cause complications with the movement of the finger), treatment may be as simple as buddy taping (splinting one finger to another by taping them together) for about four weeks, followed by an additional two weeks of limiting use of the finger.''If the fracture is unstable, the injured finger will need to be immobilized. A splint may be applied after reduction (re-aligning of the fractured fragments). If this does not maintain enough stability, a surgical procedure may be needed.''A surgeon has many different techniques for surgical immobilization, ranging from pinning the fracture with small wires to procedures with plates and screws.''The patient will most likely leave the hospital in some type of immobilizing splint or dressing. Keep the dressing clean, dry, and elevated. It is best not to use the involved hand until a hand specialist is consulted (about one week after the injury) for another X-ray to evaluate the position of the fracture fragments. If the finger is not aligned correctly, it may affect the healing of the finger and leave a permanent disability.'   To reduce swelling and bruising, apply ice to the injured finger on the way to an emergency department. Do not apply ice directly to the skin; put a towel between the ice and the finger. Make a splint to immobilize the finger. A Popsicle stick or pen may be placed next to the broken finger, and then wrap something around the stick and the finger to hold it in place. Wrap loosely - if the finger is wrapped too tightly it can cause additional swelling and may cut off circulation to the injured digit. Keep the injured finger elevated. Remove all rings or jewelry from the affected hand before swelling occurs."
What are the complications of a broken finger?,"'After reduction, immobilization, and four to six weeks of healing, the prognosis for healing is excellent for a broken finger.'   Joint stiffness is the most common problem encountered after treatment of fractures in the fingers due to scar tissue formation and the long immobilization period. Physical therapy may be prescribed (preferably by a hand therapist) to regain range of motion. Rotation can occur when one of the bones in the finger rotates abnormally during the healing process. This can cause deformity and decreased ability to use the injured finger when grasping. Nonunion is a complication of some fractures when the two ends of the bone do not heal together properly, leaving the fractured area unstable. If the skin is injured or if surgery is necessary to fix the fractured bone, infection may result."
How can a broken finger be prevented?,"'The best medicine for ''prevention'' of finger fractures is safety. Most fingers are broken from machines, self-inflicted trauma (punching something), or sporting injuries. Always use safety equipment when doing activities that may injure the hands. Injuries should be evaluated as soon possible.' "
What is a finger dislocation?,"'There are three joints located in each finger (just two in the thumb). They allow the finger to flex (bend) and extend (straighten) and give the ability of the hand to perform all its functions from grasping to waving and pinching tiny objects.''The joints in the finger got their names based on which bones in the finger make up the joint and their location in the finger. There are three phalangeal bones that make up each finger (the thumb has two). They got their names based on their position within the finger: proximal phalanx, middle phalanx, and distal phalanx. The fingernail is located near the distal phalanx.''The thumb has just two phalanges and therefore two joints within it: the MCP joint and the interphalangeal (IP) joint.''The PIP and DIP joints work like a hinge and move in just one plane. The ligaments and tendons that surround each joint keep them stable. Should the joint hyperflex or hyperextend, the bones that make up that joint can disconnect, and this is a dislocation.''Doctors describe dislocations by the displacement of the bones.''The most commonly dislocated joint is the PIP joint.''In addition to the dislocation, ''fractures'' (broken bones), ligament and tendon injuries, and nerve damage may accompany the joint injury.' The metacarpal phalangeal joint (MCP) connects the metacarpal bone of the hand and the proximal phalanx of the finger. The proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) connects the proximal and middle phalanges. The distal interphalangeal joint connects the middle and distal phalanges. Dorsal dislocation: The phalanx closer to the tip of the finger is displaced toward the back of the hand. Volar dislocation: The phalanx closer to the tip of the finger is displaced toward the palm of the hand. Lateral dislocation: The phalanx closer to the tip of the finger is displaced to the side."
What are the causes and risk factors of a finger dislocation?,"'Finger joint dislocations are traumatic and due to injury. They can be due to a fall or a finger being hit with an object, like trying to catching a ball.''In children whose skeleton has not fully developed, finger dislocations are less common, because the ligaments tend to be stronger than bone. A ''fracture'' of the phalanx growth plate is a more likely injury.' "
What are finger dislocation symptoms and signs?,"'As with any injury, the signs and symptoms of a finger dislocation include ''pain'', ''swelling'', and ''deformity''. As well, the patient will be unable to move the injured joint.''If there is associated damage to the nerve that runs near the finger joint, there may be numbness and tingling to the finger.' "
How do health care providers diagnose a finger dislocation?,"""The diagnosis begins with a history of how the injury occurred, and the patient usually knows which joint is injured and cannot move it appropriately. On physical examination, it's possible to feel and see the finger deformity. The exam may also want to focus on the rest of the hand to make certain there are no other associated injuries that might be missed. As well, the health care provider will want to assess the nerve function of the finger beyond the dislocation, since nerve injury is one of the complications of a finger dislocation.""'Medical professionals typically take ''X-rays'' of the finger to confirm the dislocation and also to look for associated fractures of the bones of the finger that might make reduction of the dislocation (returning the bones to proper alignment within the joint) difficult or cause complications later in healing.''X-rays of the injured finger are important in children, since ''growth plate fractures'' are more likely to occur than joint dislocation.' "
What are treatments and home remedies for a finger dislocation?,"'The treatment goal is to reduce the dislocation and restore function to the finger. Often a primary care or emergency provider is able to reduce the dislocation.''After joint reduction, a medical professional splints the finger to protect the joint from dislocating again and to allow the structures around the joint to heal.''The finger is a complex structure, and complications are common with dislocations. For that reason, most patients with dislocated fingers will\xa0 receive a referral to an orthopedic or hand specialist for follow-up to minimize the risk of complications and maximize the potential for normal finger function.''Some finger dislocations are complicated and need the attention of an orthopedic or hand surgeon immediately for care. Reasons for their immediate attention include the following:''Some dislocations require an operation to reduce and repair the injury.' Dislocations with phalanx fracture Open dislocation, where the skin overlying the injured joint is lacerated or torn Damage to the nerves or arteries of the finger Dislocations with tendon rupture Inability to reduce the dislocation"
What are the complications for a finger dislocation?,"'Finger dislocations can damage many structures within the finger, including the joint surfaces of the bone, the volar plate (a thickened ligament that helps stabilize the palm side of the joint), ligaments, and tendons.''Acute complications include an inability to reduce the dislocation and associated fractures. These may require surgery to repair the finger.''Open dislocations may become infected.''Long-term complications can include chronic ''stiffness'', swelling, ''pain'', and recurrent dislocation of the injured joint.''Boutonniere deformity is a complication of dorsal dislocation of the PIP joint with tendon damage and subsequent scarring that causes the PIP joint to be held in permanent flexion.''Mallet deformity can occur with a dislocated DIP joint with associated tendon rupture that causes the tip of the finger to droop and not completely straighten.' "
What is the recovery time for a finger dislocation?,"'After reduction of the injury, a medical professional will splint the damaged finger. It needs re-evaluation within a week. At that time, the patient will start range of motion exercises, and hand rehabilitation can begin.'""A splint can stabilize uncomplicated PIP and DIP dislocations, and it's possible to return to work or play almost immediately as long as the joint is protected.""'MCP dislocations are more complicated and may take 1-2 months to allow fuller function.' "
First Aid,"'First aid'' is the assistance given to an injured or sick person in need of urgent medical assistance. First aid applies to a broad range of medical situations and consists both of specific knowledge and skills (for example, what to do for each type of injury or illness) and the ability to assess a situation and make appropriate decisions (such as when to call for emergency medical assistance). '  "
First Aid Kit,"'Preparedness is a key element of first aid. While every home, auto, and boat should be equipped with a basic emergency kit that includes first aid supplies and a first aid manual, special circumstances may necessitate more advanced or specific degrees of preparation for an emergency. For example, residents of certain geographic areas where natural disasters (such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados, floods, landslides, or tsunamis) may occur should prepare for emergencies by assembling disaster preparedness kits such as earthquake kits, flood kits, andevacuation kits.''Travelers'' should also prepare to administer first aid in the region they plan to visit. In many developed countries, this may amount to packing a standard first aid kit and manual with your belongings. Medicines to prevent ''motion sickness'' and advanced awareness about the management of ''traveler'""'s ""'diarrhea'' are also helpful to ''travelers''. In the developing world or in remote regions, a ''travel medicine'"" kit should include medicines and supplies that may not be available for purchase as well as any specific products (such as insect repellant to prevent mosquito and tick bites) needed for your destination. It's also important for travelers in foreign countries to learn how to access emergency services by telephone."" "
CPR and First Aid Certification,"'Regardless of your level of skill or degree of first aid training, ''if you find yourself in a true medical emergency, always call 911 for emergency medical assistance immediately''. Likewise, if you are involved in any medical situation that is beyond your personal abilities to provide first aid, you should never hesitate to summon emergency medical assistance right away.' "
What is the definition of an epileptic seizure?,"'Epilepsy'', or seizure disorder, is a medical condition that produces seizures. A seizure usually involves convulsions and sometimes leads to loss of consciousness. ' "
What causes an epileptic seizure?,"""Seizures occur due to a malfunction of the brain's electrical system. Some seizures are caused by brain diseases, tumors, genetic conditions, or other illnesses or disorders that can be diagnosed (symptomatic seizures). When the cause for the seizures is unknown, they are referred to as idiopathic or cryptogenic seizures. ""'Seizure causes are also sub-classified into acute (an active cause, such as an active brain disease) or remote (caused by a previous event, such as injury).''Some people with seizure disorders have triggers that cause their seizures. Common seizure triggers include foods or medications, hormones, ''stress'', lack of ''sleep'', or ''sensitivity to light''. '  "
What are the symptoms of an epileptic seizure?,"'Generalized seizure symptoms include unconsciousness, muscle contractions and convulsions (which may appear as very dramatic jerking movements), tongue or lip biting, ''incontinence'', and clouded awareness. There may be weakness or loss of sensation. These symptoms may be brief or last a longer period of time. ''Some seizures only cause minor or mild symptoms and can be localized to a specific area of the body. These are called partial seizures. Symptoms of a ''partial seizure'' may include an aura (a warning symptom, often a strange sensation in the stomach), lip smacking, fidgeting, lack of awareness of surroundings, confusion, and sleepiness after the seizure. These symptoms typically last 30 seconds to 2 minutes. ' "
What first aid should be done for an epileptic seizure?,"'First aid for a seizure is aimed at keeping the person safe until the seizure stops on its own. Most seizures last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes.'   Stay calm and reassure bystanders. Loosen anything around the person's neck (clothing, ties, jewelry, etc.) that may impede breathing. Do not restrain the person – this may result in injury. Do not put anything into the person's mouth, and do not try to hold the tongue or force the mouth open. This may also cause injury. Clear the area around the person and remove any objects that could injure them (glasses, furniture, etc.). Put something flat and soft under their head. After the seizure, lay the person on their side to facilitate breathing and keep the airway open. Do not leave a person alone after a seizure – they may be disoriented or confused. If the person is known to have epilepsy it may not be necessary to call 911. However, call 911 if:the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes,another seizure begins soon after the first one ends,the person does not awaken after movements have stopped,the person has another medical condition (such as heart disease),or you think anything else might be wrong. the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, another seizure begins soon after the first one ends, the person does not awaken after movements have stopped, the person has another medical condition (such as heart disease), or you think anything else might be wrong."
What can be done to prevent an epileptic seizure?,"""There may be some ways to prevent seizures in some people. Sometimes, there is no way to prevent seizures and a person may have a seizure even if they follow all of the doctor's recommendations.""'Avoid any known seizure triggers such as foods or medications, hormones, ''stress'', lack of ''sleep'', ''dehydration'', or sensitivity to light.' Anticonvulsant medication helps manage seizures in many patients. Take all prescribed medication regularly. Do not stop taking medications or change the dose without consulting a doctor. Avoid alcohol as it may interact with anticonvulsant medication, making it less effective. Consult a doctor before taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs, or supplements as there may be drug interactions."
What were your first signs and symptoms of a brain tumor?,"'The symptoms of a ''tumor'' depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain. Some slow-growing tumors may not cause any symptoms at first. Eventually, the tumor may put pressure on the brain that may cause the signs and symptoms below''Other common signs and symptoms include''Any of these symptoms can occur alone or in combination.' Severe, persistent headaches that may not be related to an existing illness such as migraine is considered a common finding in patients with a brain tumor. Pain may be worse in the mornings and may be associated with nausea or vomiting. Headaches due to a brain tumor usually worsen with coughing, exercising or changing position. These types of headaches may not be relieved with over-the-counter medications. Another common scenario in which a brain tumor is first detected involves a person who is otherwise healthy having a sudden onset of seizures or fits. Irritability, drowsiness, apathy or forgetfulness Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs Dizziness Partial loss of vision or hearing Hallucinations, depression or mood swings Personality changes, including abnormal and uncharacteristic behavior Changes in intellect or memory problems Uncoordinated movements, unsteadiness or weakness on one side of the body Speech difficulties Loss of sense of smell Warning signs of brain tumor symptoms in women include nipple discharge, excessive body hair and lack of menstruation apart from the above symptoms"
What is a brain tumor?,"'Uncontrolled and abnormal cell growth in the brain is called a brain tumor. They are divided into two types' Primary: If any brain cells grow and multiply abnormally to cause a brain tumor, this is called a primary tumor. Secondary: If abnormal cells have spread to the brain from another part of the body, this is called a secondary tumor. Secondary or metastatic brain tumors are the most common type of brain tumors and they usually spread via the bloodstream. Cancers of the breast, lungs, kidney and skin are the ones that most commonly spread to the brain."
What are the common causes of a brain tumor?,"'The causes of brain tumor are not yet clearly known. However, there are common risk factors or triggers that may cause a brain tumor' Being overweight or obese increases the risk of certain types of brain tumors. Unhealthy lifestyle including smoking and excessive alcohol consumption may trigger abnormal cell growth. The risk of getting brain tumors becomes higher with increasing age. Repeated exposure to radiation through ionizing radiation, X-rays, and computed tomography (CT) scans, power lines, nuclear plants, mobile phones and cell phone towers may trigger tumors. Exposure to certain harmful chemicals may trigger a brain tumor. Examples include diesel exhaust, coal tar volatiles, tobacco smoke, arsenic compounds, cadmium compounds, nickel compounds and more. People who have had cancer such as leukemia as a child have a higher risk of brain tumors as an adult. Adults who have had cancer also may have a chance of getting brain tumors, but further research is needed to confirm this finding. In some rare cases, brain tumors may be genetically inherited. If a lot of people in a family have had brain tumors, an individual may be at an increased risk of the condition."
What are the treatment options for a brain tumor?,"'Treatment for a brain tumor may be customized according to the stage of tumor and patient needs. Surgery is usually the first line of treatment for brain tumors.''One or more of the following therapies may be recommended to treat the ''cancer'' or help relieve symptoms.' Craniotomy: The most common surgery for brain tumors is craniotomy, which involves opening the skull and removing the tumor. Surgery using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): When a brain tumor is in a challenging location, neurosurgeons may use this innovative open MRI system that allows them to view the tumor during surgery. This helps them remove as much of the tumor as possible without damaging other parts of the brain. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy: These may be able to stop or slow the growth of brain tumors that cannot be removed with surgery. Chemotherapy alone may be ineffective in treating brain tumors. Proton therapy: This delivers high radiation doses directly to the brain tumor site with no damage to nearby healthy tissues. It may be used to treat tumors in very sensitive areas, including in the base of the skull and along the spine. Laser interstitial thermal therapy: This is performed by implanting a laser catheter into the tumor and heating it to temperatures high enough to kill the tumor."
What is hypoglycemia?,"'Hypoglycemia'' is an abnormally ''low blood sugar'' level. If the blood ''sugar'' drops to extremely low levels, it becomes an emergency condition that can even lead to ''coma'' or death.''Hypoglycemia is most common in patients with ''diabetes mellitus'' who are taking ''insulin'' and skip their meals. Overdosing of insulin can also cause hypoglycemia.''There are two types of hypoglycemia:' Reactive hypoglycemia: This usually occurs after having a meal. Fasting hypoglycemia: Often associated with medications or disease. Enzyme deficiencies are the main underlying cause of fasting hypoglycemia."
What causes hypoglycemia?,"'Causes of hypoglycemia include:' Diabetes medication overdose (oral medicines or insulin) Fasting for prolonged period Infection Diet changes Changes in metabolism Liver disease Tumor of the pancreas Abnormalities in a hormone-secreting gland Post weight-loss surgery Drugs such as ethanol, haloperidol, pentamidine, quinine Deficiency of hormones Serious illness of heart, liver and kidney Pregnancy Growth hormone insufficiency Rare enzyme defects Unknown causes"
What are the first signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia?,'The following signs and symptoms occur when blood ''sugar'' goes below 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL): \xa0''Worsening of hypoglycemia results in:' Giddiness Sweating Pale skin Cold and moist skin Fast/irregular heartbeat Shivering Difficulty in speaking Anxiety Sleepiness Crankiness Blurred vision Confusion Loss of consciousness Seizures Coma Death
How is hypoglycemia treated?,'Hypoglycemia is primarily treated with medications. The main medications used in the treatment of hypoglycemia include:''Other therapies are:''Fasting hypoglycemia:''Reactive hypoglycemia:''Surgical treatment might be necessary for any tumor of the pancreas.' Glucose supplements: Dextrose Glucose-elevating agents: Glucagon Inhibitors of insulin hormone secretion: Diazoxide Anticancer agents: Streptozocin Dietary changes such as frequent snacking Intravenous glucose infusion Intravenous octreotide Dietary changes such as restriction of refined carbohydrates and avoidance of sugar Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose
What should I know about hypoglycemia?,"'Severe hypoglycemia can be life-threatening and fatal. Patients with reactive hypoglycemia have a better chance of improvement with dietary changes.''Hypoglycemia, if severe, can lead to coma, heart problems, impaired memory, diminished language skills and impaired coordination.''Other recommendations are:''Patients with hypoglycemia should learn to recognize early symptoms to avoid serious complications.\xa0' Do not skip meals, especially if you have diabetes and are taking medications. Exercise for at least 30 minutes to one hour after meals. Monitor blood sugar levels routinely. Avoid excessive dosing of medications. Drink alcohol moderately. Include a balanced diet in your routine. Avoid consumption of sugar. Avoid driving if you have hypoglycemia."
What is fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria)?,"'Trimethylaminuria is a disorder in which the body is unable to break down trimethylamine, a compound derived from the ''diet'' that has a strong odor of rotting fish. ' "
What are the signs and symptoms of fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria)?,"""As trimethylamine builds up in the body, it causes affected people to give off a fish-like odor in their sweat, urine, and breath. The intensity of this odor may vary over time. The strong body odor can interfere with many aspects of daily life, affecting a person's relationships, social life, and career. Some people with trimethylaminuria experience""'depression'' and social isolation as a result of this condition.'  "
What causes fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria)?,"'Although gene mutations account for most cases of trimethylaminuria, the condition can also be caused by other factors. A fish-like body odor may result from an excess of certain proteins in the diet or from an increase in bacteria that normally produce trimethylamine in the ''digestive system''. A few cases of the disorder have been identified in adults with liver or kidney disease. Temporary symptoms of this condition have been reported in a small number of premature infants and in some healthy women at the start ofmenstruation.'  "
How common is fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria)?,'Trimethylaminuria is an uncommon ''genetic disorder''; its incidence is unknown.' 
What genes are related to fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria)?,"'Mutations in the ''FMO''3 gene cause trimethylaminuria.''The FMO3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that breaks down nitrogen-containing compounds from the diet, including trimethylamine. This compound is produced by bacteria in the intestine as they help digest proteins from eggs, liver, legumes (such as soybeans and peas), certain kinds of fish, and other foods. Normally, the ''FMO3'' enzyme converts fishy-smelling trimethylamine into another molecule that has no odor. If the enzyme is missing or its activity is reduced because of a mutation in the ''FMO3'"" gene, trimethylamine is not processed properly and can build up in the body. As excess trimethylamine is released in a person's sweat, urine, and breath, it causes the strong odor characteristic of trimethylaminuria. Researchers believe that ""'stress'' and diet also play a role in triggering symptoms.' "
How do people inherit fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria)?,"'Most cases of trimethylaminuria appear to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Carriers of an ''FMO3'' mutation, however, may have mild symptoms of trimethylaminuria or experience temporary episodes of fish-like body odor.' "

What is ciguatera poisoning?,"'Ciguatera is a type of ''food poisoning''. The ciguatera toxin may be found in large reef fish, most commonly barracuda, grouper, red snapper, eel, amberjack, sea bass, and Spanish mackerel. These fish live in coral reef waters between latitudes of 35 degrees south to 35 degrees north, corresponding to the area located between the Tropic of ''Cancer'' and the Tropic of Capricorn. These geographic lines ring the earth north and south of the equator and make up the tropics. These areas include the Caribbean Sea, Hawaii, and coastal Central America.''Ciguatera toxin tends to accumulate in predator fish, such as the Barracuda and other carnivorous reef fish because they eat other fish that consume toxin-producing algae (dinoflagellates) that live in coral reef waters.''Ciguatera toxin is harmless to fish but poisonous to humans.

How Do I Get Started?,"'Before starting an ''exercise'' program, talk to your doctor about:' Medication changes. New medications can greatly affect your response to exercise; your doctor can tell you if your normal exercise routine is still safe. Heavy lifting. Make sure that lifting or pushing heavy objects and chores such as raking, shoveling, mowing, or scrubbing aren't off limits. Chores around the house can be tiring for some people; make sure you only do what you are able to do without getting tired. Safe exercises. Get the doctor's approval before you lift weights, use a weight machine, jog, or swim."
What Type of Exercise Is Best?,"'Exercise can be divided into three basic types:' Stretching: slow lengthening of the muscles. Stretching the arms and legs before and after exercising helps prepare the muscles for activity and helps prevent injury and muscle strain. Regular stretching also increases your range of motion and flexibility. Cardiovascular or aerobic: steady physical activity using large muscle groups. This type of exercise strengthens the heart and lungs and improves the body's ability to use oxygen. Aerobic exercise has the most benefits for your heart. Over time, aerobic exercise can help decrease your heart rate and blood pressure and improve your breathing. Strengthening: repeated muscle contractions (tightening) until the muscle becomes tired. For people with heart failure, many strengthening exercises are not recommended. (See below) Aerobic exercises include: walking, jogging, jumping rope, bicycling (stationary or outdoor), cross-country skiing, skating, rowing, and low-impact aerobics or water aerobics."
How Often Should I Exercise For A Healthy Heart?,"'In general, to achieve maximum benefits, you should gradually work up to an aerobic session lasting 20 to 30 minutes, at least three to four times a week. Exercising every other day will help you keep a regular aerobic exercise schedule.''Every exercise session should include a warm-up, conditioning phase, and a cool-down.' Warm-up. This helps your body adjust slowly from rest to exercise. A warm-up reduces the stress on your heart and muscles, slowly increases your breathing, circulation (heart rate), and body temperature. It also helps improve flexibility and reduce muscle soreness. The best warm-up includes stretching, range of motion activities, and the beginning of the activity at a low-intensity level. Conditioning. This follows the warm-up. During the conditioning phase, the benefits of exercise are gained and calories are burned. Be sure to monitor the intensity of the activity (check your heart rate). Don't overdo it. Cool-down. This is the last phase of your exercise session. It allows your body to gradually recover from the conditioning phase. Your heart rate and blood pressure will return to near resting values. Cool-down does not mean to sit down! In fact, do not sit, stand still, or lie down right after exercise. This may cause you to feel dizzy or lightheaded or have heart palpitations (fluttering in your chest). The best cool-down is to slowly decrease the intensity of your activity. You may also do some of the same stretching activities you did in the warm-up phase."
What Is the Rated Perceived Exertion Scale?,"'The Rated Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale is used to measure the intensity of your exercise. The RPE scale runs from 0-10. The numbers below relate to phrases used to rate how easy or difficult you find an activity. For example, 0 (nothing at all) would be how you feel when sitting in a chair; 10 (very, very heavy) would be how you feel at the end of an ''exercise stress test'' or after a very difficult activity.''In most cases, you should exercise at a level that feels 3 (moderate) to 4 (somewhat heavy). When using this rating scale, remember to include feelings of ''shortness of breath'', as well as how tired you feel in your legs and overall.' "
What Are Some Warm-Up Exercises?,"'Every exercise session should start with a warm-up. Here are some stretching exercises you can try to get yourself started.

How Can I Avoid Over Doing It?,"'Here are a few guidelines:' Gradually increase your activity level, especially if you have not been exercising regularly. Wait at least one and a half hours after eating a meal before exercising. When drinking liquids during exercise, remember to follow your fluid restriction guidelines. Take time to include a five-minute warm-up, including stretching exercises, before any aerobic activity and include a five- to 10-minute cool down after the activity. Stretching can be done while standing or sitting. Exercise at a steady pace. Keep a pace that allows you to still talk during the activity. Keep an exercise record."

General Workout Tips for People With Heart Failure," Be sure any exercise is paced and balanced with rest. Avoid isometric exercises such as push-ups and sit-ups. Isometric exercises involve straining muscles against other muscles or an immovable object. Don't exercise outdoors when it is too cold, hot, or humid. High humidity may cause you to tire more quickly; extreme temperatures can interfere with circulation, make breathing difficult, and cause chest pain. Better choices are indoor activities such as mall walking. Make sure you stay hydrated. It is important to drink water even before you feel thirsty, especially on hot days. But, be careful not to drink too much water. Follow your doctor's guidelines about how much fluid you can have in a day. Extremely hot and cold showers or sauna baths should be avoided after exercise. These extreme temperatures increase the workload on the heart. Steer clear of exercise in hilly areas. If you must walk in steep areas, make sure you slowdown when going uphill to avoid working too hard. Monitor your heart rate closely. If your exercise program has been interrupted for a few days (for example, due to illness, vacation, or bad weather), make sure you ease back into the routine. Start with a reduced level of activity, and gradually increase it until you are back where you started."

What is Flakka? What are the signs and symptoms of Flakka abuse?,"'A synthetic street drug called ""Flakka"" was in the news in late 2014 and 2015. Hospitals, doctors, police, and fire rescue crews in Florida saw patients with symptoms and signs that included''Reported cases included an agitated man ''running'' naked through traffic, a delusional drug addict who attempted to perform a sex act on a tree and then resisted arrest, and a paranoid man trying to break into a police station to seek safety. These bizarre, dangerous, and violent behaviors are directly due to the side effects of the street drug Flakka.''Flakka can be smoked, vaped with an e-''cigarette'', snorted, injected, or swallowed. When heated up, it gives off a foul-smelling smoke characterized as smelling like dirty socks.'   bizarre behavior, agitation, paranoia, and delusions of superhuman strength."
Flakka vs. bath salts,"'Word on the street is that Flakka (also called gravel or flocka) is a combination of ''heroin'' and ''crack'' ''cocaine'', or ''heroin'' and methamphetamines, but in reality, Flakka is just a newer-generation version of a type of synthetic drug called ''bath salts'' (MDPV).''Bath salts'', in general, are psychoactive synthetic ''drugs'' (designer ''drugs'') made in large quantities in foreign drug labs. These drugs are all related to a broader group of chemical compounds known as synthetic cathinones, chemically similar to a substance found in the ''khat'' plant, which is known for its amphetamine-like stimulant effects. Some brand names of synthetic cathinones include Bliss, Vanilla Sky, Lunar Wave, Cloud Nine, and White Lightning. Flakka is the street name for the synthetic cathinone called alpha-pyrrolidinopentiophenone (Alpha-PVP).''Each time one type of bath salt is made illegal, the drug labs change the chemical structure slightly and a new drug that is technically not illegal is created. In the case of Flakka, the new chemical is called alpha-pyrrolidinopentiophenone or alpha-PVP. Drug users take Flakka to get a feeling of ''euphoria'', a heightened sense of awareness, stimulation, and energy.''Flakka was also very inexpensive, costing as little as $5 for a dose. This caused people most at risk, poor desperate drug addicts and homeless people, to use it instead of more expensive drugs like ''cocaine'' or methamphetamines.' "
What are the side effects of Flakka?,"'Flakka is a dangerous drug that has many bad side effects, mostly including changes in behavior or mood. Even slight overdoses of Flakka can cause''In some of the documented ''delusions'"", individuals' experiences are of a typical paranoia, where the drug users feel they are being chased by a large group of people trying to kill them. These patients are a threat to themselves, the people around them, and the first responders (police, EMS) who are there to help them. It is common to hear reports that it takes multiple people to restrain and sedate these patients. Rescue crews and emergency department staff need to give ""'sedatives'' to these patients to calm them and make them safe.'   elevated heart rate, extreme agitation, jerking muscle movements, delirious thoughts, hyperstimulation, hallucinations, and often profound paranoia."
What are the complications of Flakka use?,"'Some complications of Flakka ''drug abuse'' can happen while the drug user is acutely agitated, if they were to harm themselves or others; however, medically, the severe consequences of the agitation caused by the drug appear later. Patients who are agitated can go into a state called ""excited ''delirium'',"" which is a medical emergency. In the excited ''delirium'' state, restrained patients struggle to free themselves, scream, flail, and can even have ''seizures''. This struggling causes a high core body temperature called hyperthermia. The combination of a high body temperature and the extreme muscle overactivity can cause other metabolic problems to happen in the body. Muscle tissue begins to break down, releasing proteins and other cellular products into the bloodstream, in a process called ''rhabdomyolysis''. The extreme struggling can also cause ''dehydration''. The end result of the cellular products and proteins released during ''rhabdomyolysis'' and ''dehydration'' can impair the filtering function of the kidneys, leading to ''renal failure'' and death. In addition, such agitation may trigger Taser use or other methods that have the potential to harm the individual when law enforcement personnel have to intervene.''Researchers have not thoroughly clinically studied the long-term effects of Flakka, but ''renal failure'' can occur that is irreversible.''Individuals with Flakka overdose were isolated to a few geographic regions of the country. The epicenter of the Flakka epidemic was Broward County, Florida, which includes the city of Fort Lauderdale.'""Since 2016, Flakka has been reported very sporadically. Law enforcement and community activists were instrumental in limiting the damage done by the drug's dangerous effects. Most reports of Flakka after 2016 turned out to be other similar chemicals in the bath salt family.""  "
Facts you should know about hot flashes,"   Hot flashes are feelings of warmth that spread over the body and last from 30 seconds to a few minutes. Hot flashes may be accompanied by redness of the skin, known as flushing, and excessive sweating. Hot flashes are a characteristic symptom of the menopausal transition (perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopause) in women, but may occasionally result from other medical conditions. About 70% of women will experience hot flashes at some point in the menopausal transition. Hot flashes in men, young women, or during pregnancy may be due to medical conditions that interfere with the body’s ability regulate temperature. Hot flashes may be treated by hormone therapy or other medications if necessary. Natural home remedies for hot flashes have been proposed and may provide relief for some women; the effectiveness of other alternative treatments has not been adequately scientifically evaluated."
What are hot flashes?,"'A hot flash is a sensation of heat that begins in the head and neck regions. Hot flashes are a common symptom experienced by women prior to, and during the early stages of the menopausal transition. However, not all women approaching the ''menopause'' will develop hot flashes.' "
How long do hot flashes last?,"'Hot flashes are typically brief, lasting from about 30 seconds to a few minutes.'""The question of how long during a woman's lifetime that hot flashes last is a different one. Traditionally, it was believed that women only experienced hot flashes for a few years. More recent data suggest that many women may experience hot flashes for longer time periods. In a study from the University of Pennsylvania, the mean duration of hot flashes was 4.9 years, but up to a third of women continued to have hot flashes for up to 10 years. In the Study of Women Across the Nation (SWAN), women had hot flashes for an average of 7.4 years total and for an average of 4.5 years after the ""'last menstrual period''.' "
What causes hot flashes?,"'The complex hormonal changes that accompany the ''aging'' process, in particular the declining levels of estrogen as a woman approaches ''menopause'', are thought to be the underlying cause of hot flashes. A disorder in thermoregulation (methods the body uses to control and regulate body temperature) is responsible for the heat sensation, but the exact way in which the changing hormone levels affect thermoregulation is not fully understood.''Hot flashes are considered to be a characteristic symptom of the menopausal transition. They also occur in men and in circumstances other than the ''perimenopause'' in women (such as young women or during pregnancy) as a result of certain uncommon medical conditions that affect the process of thermoregulation. For example, the ''carcinoid syndrome'', which results from a type of endocrine ''tumor'' that secretes large amounts of the hormone serotonin can cause hot flashes. Hot flashes can also develop as a side effect of some medications and sometimes occur with severe infections or ''cancers'' that may be associated with ''fevers'' and/or ''night sweats''.'  "
What are signs and symptoms of hot flashes?,"'The timing of the onset of hot flashes in women approaching menopause is variable.'   Hot flashes are typically brief, lasting from about 30 seconds to a few minutes. Redness of the skin, known as flushing, may accompany hot flashes. Excessive perspiration (sweating) can also occur; when hot flashes occur during sleep they may be accompanied by night sweats. Feelings of anxiety may accompany hot flashes. Occasionally, palpitations (feelings of a racing heart beat) may occur during hot flashes. While not all women will experience hot flashes, many normally menstruating women will begin experiencing hot flashes even several years prior to the cessation of menstrual periods. It is impossible to predict if a woman will experience hot flashes, and if she does, when they will begin. About 40% to 85% of women experience hot flashes at some point in the menopausal transition."
How do medical professionals diagnose the cause of hot flashes?,"'Hot flashes are a symptom, not a medical condition. Taking a thorough medical history, the health-care professional will usually be able to determine whether a woman is having hot flashes. The patient will be asked to describe the hot flashes, including how often and when they occur, and if there are other associated symptoms. A physical examination together with the medical history can help determine the cause of the hot flashes and direct further testing if necessary.''Blood tests may be performed if the diagnosis is unclear, either to measure hormone levels or to look for signs of other conditions (such as infection) that could be responsible for the hot flashes.' "
What are the treatments for hot flashes?,"'There are a variety of treatments for hot flashes such as:''Some of these have not been tested by clinical studies, nor are they approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).'   hormone therapy, bioidentical hormone therapy, other drug treatments, complementary and alternative treatments, phytoestrogens, black cohosh, and alternative therapies."
Hormone therapy for hot flashes,"'Traditionally, hot flashes have been treated with either oral or transdermal (such as a patch) forms of estrogen. Hormone therapy (HT) or ''postmenopausal'' hormone therapy (PHT), formerly referred to as ''hormone replacement therapy'' (''HRT''), consists of ''estrogens'' alone or a combination of estrogens and ''progesterone'' (progestin). All available prescription estrogen medications, whether oral or transdermal, are effective in reducing the frequency of hot flashes and their severity. Research indicates that these medications decrease the frequency of hot flashes.''However, long-term studies (the NIH-sponsored '""Women's Health""' Initiative, or WHI) of women receiving combined hormone therapy with both estrogen and progesterone were halted when it was discovered that these women had an increased risk for ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''breast cancer'' when compared with women who did not receive hormone therapy. Later studies of women taking estrogen therapy alone showed that estrogen was associated with an increased risk for ''stroke'', but not for heart attack or ''breast cancer''. Estrogen therapy alone, however, is associated with an increased risk of developing ''endometrial cancer'' (''cancer'' of the lining of the uterus) in postmenopausal women who have not had their uterus surgically removed.''More recently, it has been noted that the negative effects associated with hormone therapy were described in older women who were years beyond menopause, and some researchers have suggested that these negative outcomes might be lessened or prevented if hormone therapy was given to younger women (prior to or around the age of menopause) instead of women years beyond menopause.'""The decision in regard to starting or continuing hormone therapy, therefore, is an individual one in which the patient and doctor must take into account the inherent risks and benefits of the treatment along with each woman's own medical history. It is currently recommended that if hormone therapy is used, it should be used at the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible time."" "
Bioidentical hormone therapy for hot flashes,"'There has been increasing interest in recent years in the use of so-called ""bioidentical"" hormone therapy for perimenopausal women. Bioidentical hormone preparations are medications that contain hormones that have the same chemical formula as those made naturally in the body. The hormones are created in a laboratory by altering compounds derived from naturally-occurring plant products. Some of these so-called bioidentical hormone preparations are U.S. FDA-approved and manufactured by drug companies, while others are made at special pharmacies called compounding pharmacies, which make the preparations on a case-by-case basis for each patient. These individual preparations are not regulated by the FDA, because compounded products are not standardized.''Advocates of bioidentical hormone therapy argue that the products, applied as creams or gels, are absorbed into the body in their active form without the need for ""first pass"" metabolism in the ''liver'', and that their use may avoid potentially dangerous side effects of synthetic hormones used in conventional hormone therapy. However, studies to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of these products have not been carried out.' "
Other prescription drug treatments for hot flashes," The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications have been shown be effective in reducing menopausal hot flashes. These drugs are generally used in the treatment of depression and anxiety as well as other condition. Paroxetine (Brisdelle) is an SSRI approved to treat moderate to severe hot flashes associated with menopause. Clonidine (Catapres) is an anti-hypertensive drug that can relieve hot flashes in some women. Clonidine is taken either by pill or skin patch and decreases blood pressure. Side effects of clonidine can include dry mouth, constipation, drowsiness, or difficulty sleeping. Gabapentin (Neurontin), a drug primarily used for the treatment of seizures, has also been effective in treating hot flashes. Megestrol acetate (Megace) is a progestin that is sometimes prescribed over a short-term to help relieve hot flashes, but this drug is not usually recommended as a first-line treatment for hot flashes. Serious side effects can occur if the medication is abruptly discontinued. Megestrol may have the side effect of weight gain. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) is another progestin drug and is administered by injection to treat hot flashes. It may lead to weight gain as well as bone loss."
What natural and home remedies treat hot flashes?,"'Some women report that ''exercise'' programs or relaxation methods have helped to control hot flashes, but controlled studies have failed to show a benefit of these practices in relieving the symptoms of hot flashes. Maintaining a cool ''sleep'' environment and the use of cotton bedclothes can help ease some of the discomfort associated with hot flashes and associated night sweats.''Many women turn to alternative therapies, including herbal products, ''vitamins'', plant estrogens, and other substances, for the treatment of hot flashes. Doctors can be reluctant to recommend alternative treatments because these nonprescription products are not regulated by the FDA (like prescription medications), and their ingredients and strength can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. For products that are not regulated by the FDA, testing and proof of safety is not required for marketing of these products. Long-term, scientifically controlled studies for these products are either lacking or have not proved the safely and effectiveness of many of the so-called natural or alternative remedies.''Some alternative treatments, however, have been evaluated in well-designed ''clinical trials''. Alternative treatments that have been scientifically studied with some research include phytoestrogens (plant estrogens, isoflavones), black cohosh, and ''vitamin E''.'  "
Black cohosh for hot flashes,"'Black cohosh is an herbal preparation that is becoming more and more popular in the U.S., and the North American Menopause Society does support the short-term use of black cohosh for treating menopausal symptoms, for a period of up to six months (because of its relatively low incidence of side effects when used over the short-term).''Some studies have shown that black cohosh can reduce hot flashes, but most of the studies have not been considered to be rigorous enough in their design to firmly prove any benefit. There also have not been scientific studies done to establish the long-term benefits and safety of this product. Research is ongoing to further determine the effectiveness and safety of black cohosh.' "
Soy and other plant sources for menopause symptoms,"'Isoflavones are chemical compounds found in ''soy'' and other plants (such as chick peas and lentils) that are phytoestrogens, or plant-derived estrogens. They have a chemical structure that is similar to the estrogens naturally produced by the body, but their effectiveness as an estrogen has been determined to be much lower than true estrogens.''Some studies have shown that these compounds may help relieve hot flashes and other ''symptoms of menopause''. In particular, women who have had ''breast cancer'' and do not want to take hormone therapy (HT) with estrogen sometimes use soy products for relief of menopausal symptoms. However, some phytoestrogens can actually have anti-estrogenic properties in certain situations, and the overall risks of these preparations have not yet been determined.''There is also a perception among many women that plant estrogens are ""natural"" and therefore safer than hormone therapy, but this has never been proven scientifically. Further research is needed to fully characterize the safety and potential risks of phytoestrogens.' "
"Other vitamins, herbs, and supplements","'There are many other ''supplements'' and substances that have been used as treatments for symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, including:''For more information, please read our ''Alternative Treatments for Hot Flashes'' article.''Scientific studies to prove the safety and effectiveness of these products in relieving hot flashes have not been adequately performed.' vitamin E, licorice, evening primrose oil, dong quai, chasteberry, and wild yam."
Which type of doctor treats hot flashes?,"'Many women will consult their gynecologist for the management of hot flashes associated with approaching menopause. Hot flashes are also treated by primary care providers, including internists and family practitioners. Hot flashes related to uncommon conditions, serious infections, or cancers are treated by the specialists treating the underlying condition.' "
Is it possible to prevent hot flashes?,"'While the development of hot flashes cannot be prevented, the treatment methods as described in the above section may be able to reduce their incidence and severity.' "
What is flatfoot?,"'When the entire sole of the foot is in contact or near contact with the ground while standing, it is considered a flat foot. The result is that there is little to no arch to the foot. Flatfoot is a common disorder. It is a complex deformity, and there are types and stages that vary in degree of symptoms and disability. Flatfeet are also referred to as pes planus, posterior tibial tendon dysfunction, and fallen arches.' "
What are the different types of flatfoot?,"'There are two general types of flatfoot: flexible flatfoot and rigid flatfoot. In flexible flatfoot, the foot has a normal arch at rest (not standing or ''walking''), but it disappears once it comes in contact with the ground. If there is no arch, whether sitting or standing, they have a ""rigid"" or ""true"" flatfoot.''Flexible flatfoot is sometimes called ""pediatric flatfoot"" because it is first apparent in childhood. Congenital or rigid ""true flatfoot"" (talipes planovalgus) is much less common in children. Of note, almost all infants appear to have a flatfoot due to the fat pad on the sole of their ''feet'' and that the arch does not develop until 5 or 6 years of age.''When a rigid flatfoot develops in adults, it is called ""adult acquired flatfoot"" or ""posterior tibial tendon dysfunction."" This type of flatfoot develops because of the weakening of the tibialis posterior muscle tendon, which is a major supporting structure of the foot arch. It is a condition that leads to flattening of the arch and rolling in of the ankle. It is a progressive deformity with early symptoms of ''pain'' and swelling at the inside arch of the foot and ankle. It eventually may lead to ''arthritis'' of the foot and ankle joints.''Flexible flatfoot is usually in both ''feet'' whereas posterior tibial tendon dysfunction or adult acquired flatfoot can occur in one or both feet.' "
What are other causes of flatfoot?,"'As described above, a person may be born with a flatfoot, pediatric flexible flatfoot, or develop it as an adult (adult acquired flatfoot). Less common causes of flatfoot include the following:'   Tarsal coalitions: A condition where foot joints bridge or grow together restricting or prohibiting movement of that joint. Accessory navicular bone (os tibiale externum): a small extra bone in the posterior tibial tendon that causes a weakening of tendinous support to the arch Ligament laxity in congenital diseases such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Charcot arthropathy Trauma Obesity Diabetes Neuropathy Age Pregnancy, due to hormonal changes such as increases in elastin Osteoporosis Overuse"
What are flatfoot symptoms and signs?,"'A flatfoot may cause no symptoms. Symptoms of flatfoot include ''pain'' that may be in the inside arch, heel, or ankle and on the outside of the foot just below the ankle. Patients often complain of generalized foot ''fatigue'' as a first signs of flatfoot. Younger patients may complain their inability to keep up with their peers during physical activity. Over time, the flattening of the arch can lead to rolling in of the foot and ankle and tilting outward of the heel. Flatfoot can also cause shin ''pain'' (''shin splints'') and aching of the knee, hip, and/or lower back. Excessive inner heel wear pattern may be seen on shoes.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose flatfoot?,"'One may look at their feet to see if they have an arch when standing barefoot for a general assessment. A foot specialist will provide an in-depth evaluation usually including ''X-rays'' to determine the precise type of flatfoot, its cause, and potential treatments. A doctor may perform a thorough study of ''walking'' pattern, called gait analysis, to determine the severity of flatfoot.' "
What is the treatment for flatfoot?,"""Treatment depends on the type of flatfoot, its stage of progression, and the symptoms. Early treatment is advised whether one's condition is a flexible, rigid, or adult acquired flatfoot. Treatments include proper shoe gear, ""'over-the-counter'' inserts, custom functional orthotics, bracing, casting/immobilization, physical therapy, ''NSAIDs'', ''weight loss'', changes in activities, and surgery.' "
What is the prognosis of flatfoot?,"'Prognosis depends on the type and severity of the flatfoot. Many people with pediatric or flexible flatfoot function without any signs or symptoms and are unrestricted in their levels of activity. These people do perfectly well without any treatments. If there are symptoms, however, they are often successfully managed with conservative care. Adult acquired flatfoot or true rigid flatfoot tends to be progressive, leading to functional disability and progression of symptoms that interfere with normal daily activities. Therefore, proper diagnosis and early treatment is vital to having a good prognosis.' "
What are fleas? What do they look like?,"'Fleas are a parasitic insect that feeds on the blood of mammals and birds. There are an estimated 2,500 species of fleas in the world. The most common flea species in the U.S. is the cat flea, ''Ctenocephalides felis'', which also infests ''dogs'' and can bite humans.''Humans can be bitten by so-called ""sand fleas,"" which usually are found at the beach and in coastal areas. They actually are not insects, but tiny crustaceans, though their bite is similar to that of the cat flea. They do not infest homes.''Adult fleas are about 1/12 to 1/8 inch long, wingless, oval, flat from side to side, and dark reddish-brown. They have six long legs and can jump very high and far, about 200 times their body length. Flea larvae are pale white and measure about 3 mm in length, resembling tiny worms.' "
What does a flea bite look like on a person (pictures)?,"'Flea bites look like small red dots. These spots often occur in two to three groups or clusters with redness around them and sometimes a light halo. They tend to bite humans around the ''feet'', ankles, and lower legs.''For people who are ''allergic'' to flea bites, there can be larger areas of redness and small ''pimple''-like ''bumps''.'""The redness can last from a few hours to several days, depending on an individual's reaction, and how much (or little) the bites are scratched."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of a flea bites in humans?,"'Symptoms of flea bites on humans that will occur immediately after being bitten include:''Some people are more sensitive to flea bites, and can have allergic reactions. Symptoms of allergic reactions to flea bites include:'""Allergic reactions to flea bites can be a medical emergency, so call 911 or get to a hospital's emergency department immediately.""   Red spots with a halo Itching Hives Rash (characterized by small clusters of bumps) Swelling around the bite Difficulty breathing (shortness of breath or wheezing) Swelling of the lips or tongue Dizziness Nausea Chest pain"
"Flea bites in humans vs. bed bug bites, do they look the same?","'Flea bites and ''bed bug bites'' appear similar, but they are not the same.' Bed bug bites often look like mosquito bites. They can be red, firm, and there may be some slight swelling around the bite. Flea bites look like small clusters of red spots. Bed bug bites often appear in linear rows and can appear anywhere on the body, whereas flea bites tend to be located in clusters often on the feet and ankles. Bed bugs are nocturnal, and like to make their home in your mattress, so bites from these insects usually occur at night when you are sleeping. Fleas are also nocturnal but tend to cling to pets, and are found on furniture, drapery, and carpeting. Bed bug bites may take several days to appear and will start to itch gradually, whereas flea bites start to itch immediately and become swollen and red within an hour after the bite. Both flea bites and bed bug bites itch and can cause allergic reactions."
Do flea bites itch? Is it bad to scratch them?,'Regardless of how much they itch try not to scratch flea bites. Flea bites can itch intensely and can cause a secondary infection. Symptoms of infection from flea bites include:' Redness Pain Fever Red streaking on extremities Swollen lymph nodes
How can you to stop flea bites from itching?,"'The main symptom of flea bites is ''itching'', which can be treated with ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) anti-itch creams, lotions, or ointments.''If the itching is bothersome, an oral ''antihistamine'' such as diphenhydramine (''Benadryl'') may help. If you have an ''allergic reaction'', see a doctor. You may be prescribed a stronger ''antihistamine'' such as ''hydroxyzine'' (''Vistaril'', Atarax).'   Wash the area first to lessen the chances for infection. Apply an anti-itch topical medication such as calamine lotion (Caladryl), hydrocortisone (Cortaid, Cortizone), or diphenhydramine (Benadryl Itch Stopping Gel)."
What are natural home remedies and other treatments are used for flea bites in humans?,"'Natural and home remedies to soothe or relieve itching from flea bites include:''Avoid scratching the flea bites because you can create an ''open wound'' that will let in bacteria, and can lead to infection.'   Wrap ice packs (or frozen vegetables) in a towel and apply to the skin to relieve swelling, and to numb the area. Aloe Vera may ease redness and swelling. Witch hazel can help with itching. Rubbing alcohol can be used to dry the bites. White vinegar (dilute 1 part vinegar with 1 part water) can provide temporary relief. Tea tree oil to can relieve itching. Cool used teabags in the freezer and apply to the bite to relieve inflammation."
Can I become infected from flea bites?,"'Infection and disease can result from flea bites. Infection usually occurs because of scratching the bites. Bacterial and other debris can be present under the fingernails, and if a person vigorously scratches a ''fleabite'', they may cause the ''rash'' to become an open ''wound'' for bacteria to enter.''Fleas also can be a public health threat because they can transmit a number of diseases to both humans and animals. Diseases transmitted to humans by fleas include:' Plague (Yersinia pestis) Bartonellosis Typhus (Rickettsia typhi) Tungiasis Flea tapeworm"
How can you prevent flea bites on humans?,"'Since most flea bites are due to fleas brought into the home by pets, the best way to prevent being bitten is to prevent the fleas from getting on your pets.''If you catch fleas on pets or in your home early it is much easier to get rid of them before they spread throughout your home.''To prevent bites from sand fleas if you are on the beach:' Keep your pets away from animals you know have had fleas recently. Keep your pets out of difficult to treat places such as under decks or sheds. Mow your lawn frequently and keep the grass short. Use a flea comb to check your pet's fur for fleas. Keep pet bedding clean and wash in hot water. Vacuum carpets, rugs, and upholstered furniture frequently, especially in areas where pets sleep, and under beds, sofas and behind furniture. Dust furniture and dry clean curtains and upholstery. Use flea preventive medicine on your pet once a month (for example, Advantage, Advantix, Frontline, Revolution, Sentinel, and others). Talk to your veterinarian about the right product for your dog or cat. Avoid the beach in the early morning and late afternoon, when sand fleas feed. Use lounges or chairs rather than a towel or blanket on the sand. Wear closed shoes and socks when walking on the beach. Use insect repellant with DEET. Stay away from seaweed, a favorite food of sand fleas."
How can I tell if I have fleas in my home?,"'One of the first ways people notice they have a flea infestation is when their ''dogs'"" or cats start scratching, biting, or licking themselves excessively. You can use a flea comb to check your pet's fur for fleas and flea feces. Flea feces on your pet may look like dot-like insects or flecks of dirt or pepper.""'Once fleas have gotten onto pets it does not take long to spread through the household. Once they have infested the home, you may notice fleas hopping on your carpet, furniture, or drapery.'""If you suspect that your pet or home may have a flea infestation you can test the dark specks to see if it is flea feces. Moisten the suspected flea feces, and if it turns red or maroon in color, it is flea feces. (Flea feces is comprised of dried blood.) Another quick way to help you check for a flea infestation is to wear long white socks. Fleas like to jump on human's feet, ankles, and lower legs. The insects are dark reddish-brown, and if they jump on you while you wear white socks they will be easier to see."" "
10 natural remedies and solutions get rid of fleas on pets and in homes?,"'Getting rid of fleas is a multi-pronged approach.There are some natural solutions that may help repel fleas, however, if you have an infestation it is probably best to consult a pest-removal specialist to thoroughly rid your home of fleas, and consult your veterinarian to make sure your pets are flea-free.''Once you have gotten rid of fleas, you can use some natural remedies to prevent them from returning.''Flea bombs (foggers) do not soak into carpets well, where flea larvae live. Because of this, most pest control specialists do not recommend flea bombs because they do not consider them to be effective.''Some natural remedies that may help repel fleas in pets include:''Talk to your vet about ways to keep your dogs and cats free from fleas. Before using any home or natural flea preventive/repellant remedy on your pets, consult with your vet. Some remedies work well for some pets and not others, and some pets may have unwanted reactions to these items. The amount of any herb or oil or other product used for a pet may vary depending on their size, weight, age, breed, and overall health. It is always best to consult with your veterinarian to make sure the products and amounts you use are safe for your cats and dogs.' Treat areas of the home with antimicrobial solutions such as tea tree oil, garlic spray, or diatomaceous earth powder. A few drops of tea tree oil may be added to bath products, or it may be used as a spray on bedding, upholstery, carpets, and other fabrics. Essential oils can be used to make a homemade flea repellant spray. Common oils used include eucalyptus, peppermint, tea tree, rosewood, cedar, citrus, or lemongrass. Mix with water and put in a spray bottle. Use homemade flea traps to help get rid of fleas. In a bowl, add equal amounts of hot water and liquid hand soap, and place the bowl at the foot of your bed with a small lamp on nearby. The fleas are attracted to the warmth of the light and will fall into the trap and drown. Before you vacuum, sprinkle diatomaceous earth powder and Borax powder on carpets, rugs, and flooring. Borax can be irritating to the skin and eyes, so keep away from children. Eucalyptus trees are known to be flea-repellent, and can be planted in the yard. Add small amounts of Brewer's yeast and apple cider vinegar to your pet's drinking water to help repel fleas. Diluted apple cider vinegar may also be used a final rinse for pets after bathing. Herbal shampoos to bathe your pet(s) include eucalyptus, lavender, germanium, lemon, or tea tree. Garlic added to your pet's food may help repel fleas."
Do I have to have a pet to get flea bites?,"'While most home flea infestations occur in homes with pets, fleas can infest home without pets as well. This may happen in several scenarios.' If you recently moved into a home where previous owners had pets with fleas, and they were not properly eradicated, you may find yourself with a flea infestation. Used furniture may come infested with fleas. Neighborhood dogs or cats that have fleas may hang out near your home Pests such as rats or mice, or wild animals such as opossums, raccoons, squirrels, and skunks also can carry fleas and bring them into your home. A common public place where fleas may be found is in dog parks. They also may be found in large natural parks that are home to wild animals such as opossums, raccoons, squirrels, and skunks that can carry fleas."
What does an insect bite look like?,"'You may be bitten by an insect and get a small, painful, ''itchy'', red bump on the skin. Some ''insect bites'' may be serious and you can see the marks at the site of bite. There may be oozing from the marks in the case of a ''black widow spider bite'' or a wasp bite.''It is very difficult to know whether you were bitten by an insect if you have not seen it. However, the treatment for most ''insect bites'' is similar.' "
What  does a flea bite look like?,"'Flea bites'' look like red spots over the legs and ankles. They may appear in a cluster of two or three.''The bites are usually present over the exposed area. Marks may appear in a line of three bites called the\xa0 “breakfast, lunch, dinner pattern.” Some people may experience ''allergic'' reactions to it.''Fleas are wingless, 2 to 8-mm long, oval caterpillar-like bloodsucking parasites that mostly feed on humans and animals (cat, dog, rodents and even birds). They may jump as high as 150 times their height and travel from one body to another over a great distance. They can survive in extreme conditions for a long time without any food, even for one to two months. They were the most common transmitter of ''bubonic plague'' in the past.''If\xa0 your dermatologist suspects a ''flea bite'', they will inquire about your living conditions and recent exposure after your skin examination . There is no laboratory test to confirm that fleas are the causal agent of these ''rashes''.''If you are diagnosed/suspected to have a flea bite' Do not scratch. Wash the site with water and an antiseptic soap. Apply a cold cloth to the area to relieve the pain, redness and swelling. Take over-the-counter oral antihistamines to relieve itching such as cetirizine or loratadine. Apply some soothing lotion such as calamine or pramoxine. Avoid taking hot showers because they may worsen your itching by incubating the larvae inside the bite. You must visit your dermatologist if you find pus oozing from the sores or if the infection worsens."
What do bedbug bites look like?,"'Bedbugs'' are small red-brown insects that often live on furniture or a bed. If they bite you, you may see\xa0''If you get a ''bug bite' Red spots on the body. Itching and redness on the site of the bite (often in a line or cluster). A painful swelling if you have an allergy. Severe allergic reactions (rarely). Put a cold wet cloth on it to relieve your pain. Do not scratch to avoid spreading the infection. Keep that area clean. Apply over-the-counter antihistamine cream to ease your itching. Use steroidal creams (hydrocortisone) after consulting with your dermatologist. Always show the bites on a child to a doctor."
What are the differences between flea bites and bedbug bites?,"'It is very difficult to differentiate a flea bite and ''bedbug'' bite from looking at the ''rash''. To detect the cause of your bite, your dermatologist will examine the skin and consider your personal history and the places you visited recently.''Bedbugs'' mostly live around furniture and your bed, whereas fleas may infest your pets and any rodents in or around your living space.''Bedbug bites'' typically appear on the exposed areas such as the face, neck, hand or arms. They typically appear in a straight line or in a zigzag pattern across your skin. However, a flea bite typically appears over the ankles and lower legs.''Bedbug bites may lead to chronic ''itchy'' ''pimples'' on your skin or you may get large ''bumps'' that are painful and warm to the touch. ''Flea bites'' are easily infected by scratching and can form pus-filled ''pimples''.''Both types of bites are not usually painful, but you should check the site properly in case you have been bitten. With a flea bite, you may break out in ''hives'' (''urticaria'') sometimes, or rarely, you may get severe hypersensitivity reactions such as respiratory symptoms.''If you have been bitten by a bedbug, the itchy red bumps may last for several days. However, a flea bite takes several weeks to resolve.' "
How can I prevent the recurrence of flea and bedbug bites?,"'Eradication of fleas and ''bedbugs'' from your surroundings is essential to stop the continuation of bites and ''rashes''.''You must make sure your house and surrounding areas are completely treated for fleas, especially larvae and ''bedbugs''.''You must consult\xa0 pest control services to address any old furniture and beds for bedbugs. They can address issues with fleas and rodents such as rats and mice as well.''You must maintain the cleanliness of your home by frequently vacuuming and washing the bed linens.''You must keep your pets clean and they should be treated for any fleas.''You must wash your hands after touching pets.' "
What is flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to examine the rectum and the lower (sigmoid) colon. The flexible sigmoidoscope is a flexible tube 60 cm long and about the thickness of your little finger.  It is inserted gently into the anus and advanced slowly into the rectum and the lower colon. It is an accurate and simple method of investigating the cause of ''rectal bleeding'', change in bowel habit, and rectal symptoms such as ''pain'' and ''diarrhea''.  Flexible sigmoidoscopy also is a part of colon screening and surveillance for ''colon cancer''. ' "
What is the preparation for flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'In order to obtain accurate results, the rectum and the lower colon must be completely clean of ''stool''. Your doctor will give you detailed instructions on how to cleanse your colon. In general, this requires the use of one or two enemas prior to the procedure and may also call for a ''laxative'' and some dietary modifications. Under special circumstances, such as the presence of significant ''diarrhea'', the preparation may be waived.' "
Do I continue my medications for flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'In general, you can continue to take your regular medicines. You should, however, inform your doctor of all the prescription and non-prescription medications you are taking as well as any ''allergies'' you may have. Certain ''drugs'' increase the risk of bleeding if biopsies are performed; these include ''aspirin'', blood thinners such as ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin''), and ''NSAIDs'' such as ''Motrin'' and ''Advil''. Your doctor may ask you to stop these medications for several days before the procedure. You should also alert your doctor if you have an ''artificial heart'' valve, hip or knee prosthesis, or have a disease of the ''heart'' valves such as mitral stenosis, ''aortic stenosis'', or ''mitral regurgitation''. Patients with these conditions may need antibiotics prior to ''colonoscopy'', or dental procedures to prevent infection of the heart valves or the prosthesis.' "
What can I expect during flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'Flexible sigmoidoscopy is generally well tolerated and rarely causes any significant ''pain''. There may be a sensation of fullness, ''bloating'', pressure, or cramping during the procedure. In most instances, you will be lying on your left side while the instrument is advanced through the rectum and the colon under direct vision on a TV monitor. As the instrument is withdrawn, a careful examination is made of the lining of the colon. The procedure usually takes only 5 to 15 minutes.'  "
What if something abnormal is found during flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'If the doctor finds an area in the colon that needs further evaluation, a biopsy (small sample of tissue) can be obtained and sent to the pathology department for examination under a microscope. If a polyp is found, the doctor may remove the polyp at the same time. Polyps are small growths on the inner lining of the colon and the rectum. Most polyps are benign (not cancerous), but some polyps are ''precancerous''. Patients with precancerous polyps are usually asked to return for a colonoscopy after a more vigorous colon cleansing. Colonoscopy is a longer version of flexible sigmoidoscopy where the doctor examines the entire length of the colon. For more, please read the Colonoscopy article. The advantage of colonoscopy over flexible sigmoidoscopy is the ability to find and remove polyps in the parts of colon that are beyond the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscope. Removal of all of the precancerous polyps during colonoscopy has been shown to prevent colon ''cancer''.' "
What happens after the flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'After the procedure, the examiner will explain the findings to you. You may have some residual cramping or bloating because of the air that was instilled into your colon during the procedure. This should quickly disappear with the passage of ''gas'' or flatus. It can be expedited by ''walking'"" about in the room. Under most circumstances, you should be able to resume your regular activities upon leaving the doctor's office or the hospital."" "
What are the complications of flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'Flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsy are generally safe when the procedure is performed by properly trained individuals. Possible but rare complications include a perforation (making a hole in the wall of the colon) and bleeding from the biopsy site. The former may call for surgery.''Although complications following flexible sigmoidoscopy are rare, it is important to recognize the early signs of any possible complication. Contact your physician or the examiner if you notice any of the following: '  severe abdominal pain,  fever and/or chills, and  rectal bleeding of more than a few teaspoons."
Conclusions,"'If you still have any questions about the procedure, reasons for doing it, alternative tests, costs, and insurance coverage, do not hesitate to speak to your doctor or the staff. Most endoscopists are highly trained specialists and welcome your questions regarding the procedure, and their medical credentials and training.' "

What is the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Gastroenteritis is a nonspecific term for various inflammatory problems in the gastrointestinal tract with the most common symptoms and signs being diarrhea, ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''abdominal pains''. Gastroenteritis is often referred to as the ""stomach flu,"" however, it is not related to the ''influenza'' virus.''In the U.S., less than 2% of the estimated 100 million people with stomach ''flu symptoms'' per year ever require hospitalization, but in developing countries it is a leading cause of death, mainly due to dehydration.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'The signs and symptoms of stomach flu may vary depending upon the cause.''Symptoms may occur in some individuals with either viral or bacterial stomach flu. Symptoms also may be seen with other causes of stomach flu (drugs, food ''allergies'', toxins), for example:'   The primary symptom of viral gastroenteritis (stomach flu) is diarrhea (non-bloody). Nausea, vomiting, and some abdominal cramping may accompany the diarrhea. Mild fever (about 100 F or 37.77 C), chills, headache, and muscle aches along with feeling tired may occur in some individuals with viral gastroenteritis. Vomiting is occasional. Symptoms usually last about two to five days and then begin to resolve with viral gastroenteritis. Bacterial gastroenteritis (stomach flu) shares many of the symptoms as viral stomach flu, but in some individuals, bacteria may cause bloody diarrhea (hemorrhagic gastroenteritis). Abdominal pain Weight loss Muscle aches and pains Headache Eosinophilia (mainly in allergic gastroenteritis) Electrolyte loss Severe gastroenteritis means the person has signs of dehydration; this is a medical emergency."
What are the signs and symptoms of stomach flu (gastroenteritis) in children?,"'Children with gastroenteritis or stomach flu usually have diarrhea, but may have other symptoms, for example:' Diarrhea Refusing to eat or drink or are very thirsty Either increased or low or no urine output Weight loss Lethargy Bloody diarrhea Pinched skin that does not rapidly go back to normal is a sign of dehydration, along with decreased fluid intake."
How is the stomach flu (gastroenteritis) spread?,"'Most viral and bacterial causes of the stomach flu can be transfer to other people by direct and indirect contact, usually by the fecal-oral route.' Direct contact could involve an infant's hand touching feces-contaminated surfaces and then touching a sibling or relative; indirect contact would be like touching a door knob or railing on a cruise ship or in a dorm that is contaminated and the person touches the contaminated surface and transfers the agent by touching their mouth. Another common way to get stomach flu is drinking or eating contaminated foods and liquids."
What causes the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Bacteria and ''viruses'' -- infectious agents -- (the most common cause) are the most frequent causes of gastroenteritis in the U.S. and worldwide. Infections cause diarrhea and other symptoms by causing inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tissue. The infections increase the fluid content in the ''intestines'"" and colon by changing the gastrointestinal tract's ability to absorb water and by increasing the speed of transit (motility) for things you ingest. This, in turn, causes diarrhea. Infectious agents may physically damage intestinal cells directly or indirectly with secreted toxins."" "
What are the most common causes of the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'The most prevalent cause of gastroenteritis in the U.S. and the world is '' Norovirus''. It causes about 50%-70% of viral gastroenteritis cases, while '' Rotavirus, Astrovirus, ''Adenovirus'', and ''Sapovirus'' ''strains'' cause most of the other viral gastroenteritis infections. ''Norovirus'' also was listed as the leading cause of gastroenteritis in children under 5 years old according to the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC).''Bacterial causes of gastroenteritis that occur worldwide are ''Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter Aeromonas'', and '' ''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli'') ''strains of bacteria. Other bacteria like ''Clostridium, ''Vibrio'', Campylobacter'', and ''Yersinia spp'' can cause outbreaks occasionally. Occasionally, some bacterial causes of gastroenteritis (for example, ''Salmonella'' and , certain ''E. coli'' strains) may produce hemorrhagic or bloody diarrhea.''Parasites such as ''Giardia'', Cryptosporidium'', and ''Entamoeba'' infections can cause gastroenteritis and occasionally, other parasites have outbreaks such as the ''Cyclospora'' outbreak that occurred in 2012 to 2013 in the U.S.''There are many other less frequent causes of gastroenteritis such as food ''allergies'' (eosinophilic gastroenteritis), antibiotics, and toxins. Gastroenteritis symptoms are frequently listed as possible side effects of many medicines.''In most instances, food and ''drinks'' come into contact with feces contaminated with the infecting agent. This can happen in the fields, or in transport, storage, and processing of food and drinks. In processed foods and drinks, this contamination is relatively rare, but when it occurs, an outbreak of the disease is often traced back to faulty equipment, human errors in the processing and/or a breakdown of quality-control procedures.'  "
Is the stomach flu (gastroenteritis) contagious?," The large majority of causes (viral and bacterial) of gastroenteritis are contagious, usually through food or water contamination. In addition, they can be transferred person to person. Exposures to body fluids (for example, feces or droplets containing infectious agents) are common sources that transmit the disease to others (See transmission section). A few causes of gastroenteritis are not contagious, for example, food allergies or the side effects of medications."
Who gets the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Gastroenteritis (stomach flu) is a common, worldwide disease and almost everyone suffers from it a few times in their life because it is almost impossible to avoid contact with some of the viral and bacterial causes.' People living in crowded conditions (military, cruise ships, dorms) are at higher risk, as are people living in developing countries who often have a diet that contains contaminated food or water. Infants, children, and some adults (elderly, immunosuppressed) are at higher risk because of immature or depressed immune systems and also because they can become dehydrated faster than older children and adults. Some people taking antibiotics are at higher risk because the antibiotics depress the normal GI microbes and allow bacteria or viruses like Clostridium difficile to predominate and cause disease. People who do not practice good hygiene and hand washing techniques are at higher risk, as are those who eat under cooked and/or unwashed foods or drink from potentially contaminated fluid sources (rivers, streams, unpasteurized milk, for example)."
When should you call a doctor for the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'If gastroenteritis symptoms last more than about five days, increase in severity (fever of 101 F or 38.33 C or higher), or a person develops bloody diarrhea, dehydration, constant ''abdominal pain'' or other symptoms see a physician. The patient may have some gastroenteritis symptoms but may have a disease more serious than self-limiting gastroenteritis. Signs and ''symptoms of dehydration'' may include decreased or no urine production, dry ''mucus'' membranes, ''dry mouth'' or skin, no tears, ''weakness'', ''lightheadedness'' and ''low blood pressure'', while children may show little or no urination, become lethargic, have skin that ""tents up"" when pinched. Signs of dehydration in anyone are good reasons to see a doctor immediately.' "
How do you know that you have the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'There are no specific tests for gastroenteritis, thus gastroenteritis is most often diagnosed by the symptoms it produces, mainly diarrhea. Because gastroenteritis is usually a self-limited disease, the large majority of people are never seen or diagnosed by a doctor. However, during outbreaks like those seen on cruise ships, viral and bacterial cultures or ''PCR'' and other immunologically based tests can eventually identify the causative pathogen. By the time this identification occurs, most of the individuals with gastroenteritis have begun to recover.''When gastroenteritis symptoms become severe, most public health officials and health care professionals run such tests to identify the causative agent of a specific disease, based on all of the history of the patients, physical exams, and symptoms. In addition, patients with similar histories of recent food or drink they had in common with others often helps to discover the source of the disease (for example, people who got diarrhea had salads from the same food source).'

Are the stomach flu (gastroenteritis) and food poisoning the same condition?,"'Although the stomach flu and ''food poisoning'' share some common symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, ''stomach cramps'', muscle aches, for example, they are not exactly the same condition.''Consequently, there is some crossover between the two terms.''In addition:' Stomach flu or gastroenteritis means any nonspecific inflammatory problem in the gastrointestinal tract; some doctors consider the stomach flu to be more narrowly defined as a viral infection that attacks the digestive system. Food poisoning specifically is caused by eating or drinking contaminated food or fluid that contains bacteria, viruses, parasites and/or their toxins they produce. Food poisoning usually is found in small outbreaks that occur among individuals that have ingested the same foods or drink, and symptoms occur rapidly within hours; whereas the stomach flu has a more gradual onset of symptoms and usually lasts longer than food poisoning. Stomach flu is highly contagious and can be spread quickly to other individuals; whereas food poisoning usually requires ingesting the poison and does not easily spread to other individuals."
Are the stomach flu (gastroenteritis) and the flu (influenza) the same infection?,"'Although both the stomach flu and the flu (influenza) may be caused by viruses, the viral genus and species are different for each entity.' The viruses that cause the majority of stomach flu (gastroenteritis) are Norovirus spp; whereas the viruses that cause influenza are mainly Influenza A and B viral spp and subtypes. Stomach flu results mainly in problems with the gastrointestinal tract while influenza (flu) involves the respiratory tract. These two problems are not the same thing."
What foods are recommended to eat (diet ) when you have the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Some health care professionals suggest a special diet for the gastroenteritis, especially for viral and/or bacterial infections in children. First and foremost is adequate fluid rehydration to prevent dehydration.''The diet frequently suggested is termed the ""BRAT"" diet. This diet consists of foods that are not usually irritating but soothing for the gastrointestinal tract. The ''BRAT diet'"" stands for bananas, rice, applesauce and toast. Although some doctors think this diet may not markedly benefit patients, others recommend it for both adults and children for a day or two to make the transition from the resolving symptoms of acute gastroenteritis to the patient's previously normal diet."" "
"What natural and home remedies help soothe stomach flu (gastroenteritis)

What is the treatment for the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Most people with the stomach flu require no formal treatment. The key to a rapid and safe recovery at home (home remedy) is proper hydration. If dehydration occurs, the patient should be evaluated by a doctor. Many health care professionals choose to begin IV fluids, the treatment of choice for rapid rehydration.''Other medications may be prescribed to reduce the symptoms of gastroenteritis. To reduce vomiting, ''promethazine'' (Phenergan), ''prochlorperazine'' (''Compazine''), or ''ondansetron'' (''Zofran'') are often used. Some physicians suggest using these agents only as a suppository or rapidly disintegrating tablet on the tongue since patients may vomit the pills up. Others may prescribe ''diphenoxylate and atropine'' (''Lomotil'') or lopermadine (''Imodium'') to slow diarrhea while others do not as the drugs may prolong the disease in some individuals. Many doctors recommend no medical treatment for gastroenteritis symptoms as all of the drugs have side effects and if the patient stays well hydrated, the symptoms usually stop soon anyway.'""As the gastroenteritis symptoms abate, especially vomiting, doctors may recommend a BRAT diet (bananas, rice, apples and toast) for a day or two before returning to the patient's regular diet. Potatoes, lean meat like chicken and whole grains can help replace nutrients and ""'electrolytes'' lost with diarrhea.''Patients who have more serious symptoms or other symptoms in addition to gastroenteritis need to be evaluated, diagnosed, and treated by a physician because the patient will likely have a specific disease that will need treatment. The treatment will depend on the cause of the illness (for example, salmonellosis or ''Clostridium difficile'' toxin). Antibiotics and other treatments may not be recommended for some of these diseases so an accurate diagnosis of the disease is important. For ''Clostridium difficile'' infected patients, antibiotic sensitivity testing may need to be done to determine the most effective antibiotics to use.'

How long does the stomach flu (gastroenteritis) last?,"'Depending upon the cause of gastroenteritis, it may be considered acute or chronic.' Acute gastroenteritis (viral) lasts about seven to 14 days, and is then usually self-cured. Chronic gastroenteritis (for example, allergic gastroenteritis) may last for months or longer if not diagnosed and appropriately treated."
What are complications of the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'Most patients who get gastroenteritis have no complications and will completely recover. The major complication for some patients is dehydration; infants, children, the elderly and immunosuppressed are at higher risk for this complication. In many third world countries, hydration of infants is difficult at best so there are many infant deaths worldwide due to dehydration caused by gastroenteritis.'  "
What is the prognosis for the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'The prognosis (outlook) for complete recovery is excellent in most people infected with viral and bacterial caused gastroenteritis, as long as the person keeps well hydrated. Because infants, children, ''pregnant'' women, and adults that are elderly or immunosuppressed, usually dehydrate faster than healthy adults and sometimes are more difficult to rehydrate orally, their prognosis can range from excellent to poor. Their prognosis depends on how dehydrated they become and how effective are the attempts to rehydrate the patient.''The prognosis for those patients that develop gastroenteritis symptoms as part of a specific disease process (for example, ''shigellosis'') vary from good to poor, depending on the severity of the specific disease process.' "
Can you prevent from getting the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"'There is no diet that will prevent gastroenteritis but food preparation plays a strong role in preventing gastroenteritis. In general, there are some actions people can do to prevent or reduce the chance of getting gastroenteritis, including:''There is a vaccine available against rotavirus that has reduced this infection in children. Also, there is a vaccine available against cholera-causing bacteria (''Vibrio''), but it is not widely available. A clinical trial of a Norovirus vaccine was done with some success. It is likely in the near future commercial ''vaccines'' against some causes will be available.' Hand washing, especially before eating and after any close association with an infected person or items (clothing, bedding, toys) they have touched Launder items daily that infected persons wear Avoid direct contact with infected individuals when possible Do not eat undercooked foods, especially meats Do not eat raw foods or drink untreated water Do not drink untreated or unpasteurized fluids, especially milk Thoroughly wash any produce, especially in third world countries, before eating While traveling, avoid all raw foods and ice; drink only from sealed bottled products and use bottled water for tooth brushing"
Which specialties of doctors treat the stomach flu (gastroenteritis)?,"""Most individuals with viral or mild bacterial caused gastroenteritis require no treatment or can be treated by the patient's primary care provider or pediatrician. For more patients with more severe gastroenteritis, such infectious disease specialists, gastroenterologists, ""'emergency medicine'' specialists, allergists, critical care physicians, and hematologists may be consulted.' "
What is the swine flu?,"'Swine flu (swine influenza) is a respiratory disease caused by viruses (influenza viruses) that infect the respiratory tract of pigs, resulting in nasal secretions, a barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine flu produces most of the same symptoms in pigs as human flu produces in people. Swine flu can last about one to two weeks in pigs that survive. Swine influenza virus was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in the U.S. and has been recognized by pork producers and veterinarians to cause infections in pigs worldwide. In a number of instances, people have developed the swine flu infection when they are closely associated with pigs (for example, farmers, pork processors), and likewise, pig populations have occasionally been infected with the human flu infection. In most instances, the cross-species infections (swine-origin virus to man; human flu virus to pigs) have remained in local areas and have not caused national or worldwide infections in either pigs or humans. Unfortunately, this cross-species situation with influenza viruses (human infections with swine viruses) has had the potential to change. Investigators decided the 2009 so-called ""swine flu"" strain, first seen in Mexico, should be termed novel H1N1 flu since it was mainly found infecting people and exhibits two main surface antigens, H1 (hemagglutinin type 1) and N1 (neuraminidase type1). The eight RNA strands from novel H1N1 flu have one strand derived from human flu ''strains'', two from avian (bird) strains, and five from swine strains.''The main swine flu viruses in pigs in the recent years are swine triple reassortant (tr; it means a viral strain with genes from three different organisms) H1N1, trH3N2, and trH1N2. However, in August 2018, China first reported a new swine flu outbreak in pigs in Liaoning province. The pig flu strain known as African swine flu (although some researchers think it originated in Russia), almost 100% fatal to pigs, was the cause. This strain is highly infectious, survives in heat and ''cold'' environments, and can remain viable and infectious on surfaces for days to weeks. Currently, there is no effective ''vaccine'"" or drug to stop its spread, so the disease is treated by immediate slaughter of infected pigs. China has about 50% of the world's pig population and relies on pork to provide a large amount of protein for the Chinese population. Culling the pig population in China may result in China needing to import pork that would likely be a large economic blow to China's economy. This virus has not yet been detected in the U.S. This flu strain reportedly does not spread to humans."" "
How is swine flu transmitted? Is swine flu contagious?,"'Swine influenza is transmitted from person to person by ''inhalation'' or ingestion of droplets containing virus from people ''sneezing'' or ''coughing''; it is not transmitted by eating cooked pork products. The newest swine flu virus that has caused swine flu is influenza A H3N2v (commonly termed H3N2v) that began as an outbreak in 2011. The ""v"" in the name means the virus is a variant that normally infects only pigs but has begun to infect humans. There have been small outbreaks of H1N1 influenza since the pandemic; a recent one is in India where at least three people have died.' "
What is the incubation period for swine flu?,"'The incubation period for swine flu is about one to four days, with the average being two days; in some people, the incubation period may be as long as about seven days in adults and children.' "
What is the contagious period for swine flu?,"'The contagious period (human-to-human viral infection) for swine influenza in adults usually begins one day before symptoms develop in an adult and it lasts about five to seven days after the person becomes sick. However, people with weakened immune systems and children may be contagious for a longer period of time (for example, about 10 to 14 days).' "
How long does the swine flu last?,"'In uncomplicated infections, swine flu typically begins to resolve after three to seven days, but the malaise and cough can persist two weeks or more in some patients. Severe swine flu may require hospitalization that increases the length of time of infection to about nine to 10 days.' "
What causes swine flu?,"'The cause of the 2009 swine flu was an influenza A virus type designated as H1N1. In 2011, a new swine flu virus was detected. The new strain was named influenza A (H3N2)v. Only a few people (mainly children) were first infected, but officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) reported increased numbers of people infected in the 2012-2013 flu season. Currently, there are not large numbers of people infected with H3N2v. Unfortunately, another virus termed H3N2 (note no ""v"" in its name) has been detected and caused flu, but this strain is different from H3N2v. In general, all of the influenza A viruses have a structure similar to the H1N1 virus; each type has a somewhat different H and/or N structure.' "
Why is swine flu now infecting humans?,"'Many researchers now consider that two main series of events can lead to swine flu (and also avian or ''bird flu'') becoming a major cause for influenza illness in humans.'""First, the influenza viruses (types A, B, C) are enveloped RNA viruses with a segmented genome; this means the viral RNA genetic code is not a single strand of RNA but exists as eight different RNA segments in the influenza viruses. A human (or bird) influenza virus can infect a pig respiratory cell at the same time as a swine influenza virus; some of the replicating RNA strands from the human virus can get mistakenly enclosed inside the enveloped swine influenza virus. For example, one cell could contain eight swine flu and eight human flu RNA segments. The total number of RNA types in one cell would be 16; four swine and four human flu RNA segments could be incorporated into one particle, making a viable eight RNA-segmented flu virus from the 16 available segment types. Various combinations of RNA segments can result in a new subtype of virus (this process is known as antigenic shift) that may have the ability to preferentially infect humans but still show characteristics unique to the swine influenza virus (see Figure 1). It is even possible to include RNA strands from birds, swine, and human influenza viruses into one virus if a single cell becomes infected with all three types of influenza (for example, two bird flu, three swine flu, and three human flu RNA segments to produce a viable eight-segment new type of flu viral genome). Formation of a new viral type is considered to be antigenic shift; small changes within an individual RNA segment in flu viruses are termed antigenic drift (see figure 1) and result in minor changes in the virus. However, these small genetic changes can accumulate over time to produce enough minor changes that cumulatively alter the virus' ""'makeup'' over time (usually years).''Second, pigs can play a unique role as an intermediary host to new flu types because pig respiratory cells can be infected directly with bird, human, and other mammalian flu viruses. Consequently, pig respiratory cells are able to be infected with many types of flu and can function as a ""mixing pot"" for flu RNA segments (see figure 1). Bird flu viruses, which usually infect the gastrointestinal cells of many bird species, are shed in bird feces. Pigs can pick these viruses up from the environment, and this seems to be the major way that bird flu virus RNA segments enter the mammalian flu virus population. Figure 1 shows this process in H1N1, but the figure represents the genetic process for all flu viruses, including human, swine, and avian strains like H1N2 (bird flu).' "
What are swine flu symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of swine flu are similar to most influenza infections: ''fever'' (100 F or greater), cough (usually dry), nasal secretions, ''fatigue'', and ''headache'', with ''fatigue'' being reported in most infected individuals. Some patients may also get a ''sore throat'', ''rash'', body (muscle) aches or pains, ''headaches'', ''chills'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''. In Mexico, many of the initial patients infected with H1N1 influenza were young adults, which made some investigators speculate that a strong immune response, as seen in young people, may cause some collateral tissue damage. The incubation period from exposure to first symptoms is about one to four days, with an average of two days. The symptoms last about one to two weeks and can last longer if the person has a severe infection.''Some patients develop severe respiratory symptoms, such as ''shortness of breath'', and need respiratory support (such as a ventilator to breathe for the patient). Patients can get ''pneumonia'' (bacterial secondary infection) if the viral infection persists, and some can develop ''seizures''. Death often occurs from secondary bacterial infection of the ''lungs''; appropriate antibiotics need to be used in these patients. The usual mortality (death) rate for typical influenza A is about 0.1%, while the 1918 ""Spanish flu"" epidemic had an estimated mortality rate ranging from 2%-20%. Swine (H1N1) flu in Mexico had about 160 deaths and about 2,500 confirmed cases, which would correspond to a mortality rate of about 6%, but these initial data were revised and the mortality rate worldwide was estimated to be much lower. Fortunately, the mortality rate of H1N1 remained low and similar to that of the conventional flu (average conventional flu mortality rate is about 36,000 per year; projected H1N1 flu mortality rate was 90,000 per year in the U.S. as determined by the president\'s advisory committee, but it never approached that high number).''Fortunately, although H1N1 developed into a pandemic (worldwide) flu strain, the mortality rate in the U.S. and many other countries only approximated the usual numbers of flu deaths worldwide. Speculation about why the mortality rate remained much lower than predicted includes increased public awareness and action that produced an increase in hygiene (especially hand washing), a fairly rapid development of a new vaccine, and patient self-isolation if symptoms developed.'  "
What types of health care professionals treat swine flu?,"""Almost all uncomplicated patients with swine flu can be treated at home or by the patient's pediatrician, primary care provider, or emergency-medicine doctor. For more complicated and/or severe swine flu infections, specialists such as critical care specialists, lung specialists (pulmonologists), and infectious-disease specialists may be consulted."" "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose swine flu?,"""Swine flu is presumptively diagnosed clinically by the patient's history of association with people known to have the disease and their symptoms listed above. Usually, a quick test (for example, nasopharyngeal swab sample) is done to see if the patient is infected with influenza A or B virus. Most of the tests can distinguish between A and B types. The test can be negative (no flu infection) or positive for ""'type A'' and B. If the test is positive for type B, the flu is not likely to be swine flu. If it is positive for type A, the person could have a conventional flu strain or swine flu. However, the accuracy of these tests has been challenged, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has not completed their comparative studies of these tests. However, a new test developed by the CDC and a commercial company reportedly can detect H1N1 reliably in about one hour; the test was formerly only available to the military. In 2010, the FDA approved a commercially available test that could detect H1N1 within four hours. Most of these rapid tests are based on ''PCR'' technology.'""Swine flu is definitively diagnosed by identifying the particular antigens (surface proteins) associated with the virus type. In general, this test is done in a specialized laboratory and is not done by many doctors' offices or hospital laboratories. However, doctors' offices are able to send specimens to specialized laboratories if necessary. Because of the large number of novel H1N1 swine flu cases that occurred in the 2009-2010 flu season (the vast majority of flu cases [about 95%-99%] were due to novel H1N1 flu viruses), the CDC recommended only hospitalized patients' flu virus strains be sent to reference labs to be identified. H3N2v flu strains and other flu virus strains are diagnosed by similar methods."" "
What is the treatment for swine flu?,"'The best treatment for influenza infections in humans is prevention by vaccination. Work by several laboratories has produced ''vaccines''. The first H1N1 vaccine released in early October 2009 was a nasal spray vaccine that was approved for use in healthy individuals ages 2-49. However, the use of nasal spray has not been recommended since 2016. The injectable vaccine, made from killed H1N1, became available in the second week of October 2009. This vaccine was approved for use in ages 6 months to the elderly, including ''pregnant'' females. The CDC approved both of these ''vaccines'' only after they had conducted ''clinical trials'' to prove that the ''vaccines'' were safe and effective.''Almost all vaccines have some side effects. Common side effects of H1N1 vaccines (alone or in combination with other flu viral strains) are typical of flu vaccines used over many years and are as follows:''The flu shot (vaccine) is made from killed virus particles so a person cannot get the flu from a flu shot. However, the nasal spray vaccine contains live virus that have been altered to hinder its ability to replicate in human tissue. People with a suppressed immune system should not get vaccinated with the nasal spray. Also, most vaccines that contain flu viral particles are cultivated in eggs, so individuals with an ''allergy'' to eggs were cautioned about getting the vaccine unless tested and advised by their doctor that they are cleared to get it. However, more refined vaccine preparations have contained very few egg allergens, so the egg ''allergy'' factor of vaccines has been almost eliminated. Like all vaccines, rare events may occur in some rare cases (for example, swelling, ''weakness'', or shortness of breath). About one person in 1 million who gets the vaccine may develop a neurological problem termed Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can cause weakness or ''paralysis'', difficulty ''breathing'', bladder and/or bowel problems, and other nerve problems. If any symptoms like these develop, see a physician immediately.''Several antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu. The most used are zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu), both of which are also used to prevent or reduce influenza A and B symptoms. These ''drugs'' should not be used indiscriminately, because viral resistance to them can and has occurred. Also, they are not recommended if the ''flu symptoms'' already have been present for 48 hours or more, although hospitalized patients may still be treated past the 48-hour guideline. The CDC has suggested in their guidelines that pregnant females can be treated with the two antiviral agents. Severe infections in some patients may require additional supportive measures such as ventilation support and treatment of other infections like ''pneumonia'' that can occur in patients with a severe flu infection. Two other new antiviral drugs (Rapivab and Xofluza) may also be used under certain conditions. Some researchers suggest the data on Tamiflu and Relenza are not correct and suggest the antivirals are not effective.''On Dec. 22, 2014, the FDA approved the first new anti-influenza drug (for H1N1 and other influenza virus types) in 15 years, peramivir injection (Rapivab). It is approved for use in the following settings:''Diarrhea'', skin infections, ''hallucinations'', and/or altered behavior may occur as side effects of this drug.''Another new drug, baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza), is an oral antiviral approved in 2018 for use in children 12 years and older.'   Flu shot: Soreness, redness, minor swelling at the shot site, muscle aches, low-grade fever, and nausea do not usually last more than about 24 hours. Nasal spray: runny nose, low-grade fever, vomiting, headache, wheezing, cough, and sore throat Intradermal shot: redness, swelling, pain, headache, muscle aches, fatigue Adult patients for whom therapy with an intravenous (IV) medication is clinically appropriate, based upon one or more of the following reasons:The patient is not responding to either oral or inhaled antiviral therapy, ordrug delivery by a route other than IV is not expected to be dependable or is not feasible, orthe physician decides that IV therapy is appropriate due to other circumstances. The patient is not responding to either oral or inhaled antiviral therapy, or drug delivery by a route other than IV is not expected to be dependable or is not feasible, or the physician decides that IV therapy is appropriate due to other circumstances. Pediatric patients for whom an intravenous medication is clinically appropriate because:The patient is not responding to either oral or inhaled antiviral therapy, ordrug delivery by a route other than IV is not expected to be dependable or is not feasible. The patient is not responding to either oral or inhaled antiviral therapy, or drug delivery by a route other than IV is not expected to be dependable or is not feasible."
What is the history of swine flu in humans?,"'In 1976, there was an outbreak of swine flu at Fort Dix. This virus was not the same as the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, but it was similar insofar as it was an influenza A virus that had similarities to the swine flu virus. There was one death at Fort Dix. The government decided to produce a vaccine against this virus, but the vaccine was associated with rare instances of neurological complications (Guillain-Barré syndrome) and was discontinued. Some individuals speculate that formalin, used to inactivate the virus, may have played a role in the development of this complication in 1976. One of the reasons it takes a few months to develop a new vaccine is to test the vaccine for safety to avoid the complications seen in the 1976 vaccine. Individuals with active infections or diseases of the nervous system are also not recommended to get flu vaccines.''Early in the spring of 2009, H1N1 flu virus was first detected in Mexico, causing some deaths among a ""younger"" population. It began increasing during the summer 2009 and rapidly circulated to the U.S. and to Europe and eventually worldwide. The WHO declared it first fit their criteria for an epidemic and then, in June 2009, the WHO declared the first flu pandemic in 41 years. There was a worldwide concern and people began to improve in hand washing and other prevention methods while they awaited vaccine development. The trivalent vaccine made for the 2009-2010 flu season offered virtually no protection from H1N1. New vaccines were developed (both live and killed virus) and started to become available in September 2009-October 2009. The CDC established a protocol guideline for those who should get the vaccine first. By late December to January, a vaccine against H1N1 was available in moderate supply worldwide. The numbers of infected patients began to recede and the pandemic ended. However, a strain of H1N1 was incorporated into the yearly trivalent vaccine for the 2010-2011 flu season because the virus was present in the world populations.''As stated in the first section of this article, a new strain of swine flu, (H3N2)v, was detected in 2011; it has not affected any large numbers of people in the current flu season. However, another antigenically distinct virus with the same H and N components (termed H3N2 (note no ""v"") has caused flu in humans; viral antigens were incorporated into the 2013-2014 seasonal flu shots and nasal spray vaccines.''In India in 2015-2016, a large outbreak of swine flu killed more than 1,900 people. During 2016, the numbers of infected people and deaths due to swine flu dropped, but now in 2017 there is a marked resurgence of the disease. The new outbreak of swine flu that began in January 2017 has resulted in 22,186 people being diagnosed with the infection. There have been 1,094 recorded deaths in 8 months, and the spread of the infection shows no signs of slowing. In the first three weeks of August 2017, 342 deaths were due to swine flu. Unfortunately, private hospitals and clinics do not have to report the number of swine flu diagnoses or deaths, so it is possible according to one medical director of a private clinic, that the current statistics represent ""possibly just the tip of the iceberg."" In the U.S., the 2017-2018 flu season was termed a high severity season by the CDC because an estimated 80,000 people died of flu and its complications.' "
"What 
are the risk factors for swine flu?","'Vaccination to prevent influenza is particularly important for people who are at increased risk for severe complications from influenza or at higher risk for influenza-related doctor or hospital visits. When vaccine supply is limited, vaccination efforts should focus on delivering vaccination to the following people since these populations have a higher risk for H1N1 and some other viral infections according to the CDC:'   All children 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of age All people 50 years of age and older Adults and children who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma) or cardiovascular (except isolated hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurological, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus) People who have immunosuppression (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by HIV) Women who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season Children and adolescents (6 months to 18 years of age) who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities American Indians/Alaska natives People who are morbidly obese (BMI ≥40) Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, health care personnel treating patients) Household contacts and caregivers of children under 5 years of age and adults 50 years of age and older, with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children less than 6 months age Household contacts and caregivers of people with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza"
Is it possible to prevent swine flu with a vaccine?,"'The CDC recommends for the 2018-2019 flu season that everyone 6 months old and older should get a flu shot to prevent or reduce the chance of getting the flu. The best way to prevent novel H1N1 swine flu is vaccination. The CDC recommendations that apply to H1N1, H3N2, and other flu viruses are almost identical to those above-mentioned recommendations for patients at risk when vaccine doses are limited and are as follows:''The CDC occasionally makes changes and updates its information on vaccines and other recommendations about any current flu pandemics. The CDC states, ""for the most accurate health information, visit http://www.cdc.gov or call 1-800-CDC-INFO, 24/7."" Caregivers should check the vaccine package inserts for more detailed information on the vaccines when they become available.''The CDC says that a good way to prevent any flu disease is to avoid exposure to the virus; this is done by frequent hand washing, not touching your hands to your face (especially the nose and mouth), and avoiding any close proximity to or touching any person who may have flu symptoms. Since the virus can remain viable and infectious for about 48 hours on many surfaces, good hygiene and cleaning with soap and water or ''alcohol''-based hand disinfectants are also recommended. Some physicians say face masks may help prevent getting airborne flu viruses (for example, from a cough or sneeze), but others think the better use for masks would be on those people who have symptoms and sneeze or cough.''The use of Tamiflu, Relenza, or other antivirals may help prevent the flu if taken before symptoms develop or reduce symptoms if taken within about 48 hours after symptoms develop. Some investigators say that administration of these drugs is still useful after 48 hours, especially in high-risk patient populations. However, taking these drugs is not routinely recommended for prevention for the healthy population because investigators suggest that as occurs with most drugs, flu strains will develop resistance to these medications. During the H1N1 pandemic, the CDC made further suggestions about the use of these antiviral medications and developed the interim guidelines for use of Tamiflu, Relenza, and recently updated information for new antivirals peramivir (Rapivab) and Xofluza as follows:''In general, people who have symptoms often undertake preventive measures to prevent the spread of flu. Symptomatic people should stay at home, avoid crowds, and take off from work or school until the disease is no longer transmittable (about two to three weeks) or until medical help and advice is sought. Sneezing, coughing, and nasal secretions need to be kept away from other people; simply using tissues and disposing of them will help others. Quarantining patients is usually not warranted, but such measures depend on the severity of the disease. The CDC recommends that people who appear to have an influenza-like illness upon arrival at work or school or become ill during the day be promptly separated from other people and be advised to go home until at least 24 hours after they are free of fever (100 F [37.8 C] or greater), or signs of a fever, without the use of fever-reducing medications. The novel H1N1 swine flu disease takes about seven to 10 days before ''fevers'' stop, but research data suggests waiting until the cough is gone since many people are still infectious about one week after fever is gone. However, the CDC did not extend their recommendations to stay home for that extra week.' Are aged 6 months through 4 years (59 months) Are aged 50 years and older Have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus) Are immunosuppressed (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus) Are or will be pregnant during the influenza season Are aged 6 months through 18 years and receiving long-term aspirin therapy and who therefore might be at risk for experiencing Reye's syndrome after influenza virus infection Are residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities Are American Indians/Alaska Natives Are morbidly obese (body-mass index is 40 or greater) Are health care personnel Are household contacts and caregivers of children aged younger than 5 years and adults aged 50 years and older, with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children aged younger than 6 months Are household contacts and caregivers of people with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza As in previous recommendations, all children aged 6 months to 8 years of age who receive a seasonal influenza vaccine for the first time should receive two doses. Children who received only one dose of a seasonal influenza vaccine in the first influenza season should receive two doses rather than one in the following influenza season. A newly approved inactivated trivalent vaccine containing 60 mcg of hemagglutinin antigen per influenza vaccine virus strain (Fluzone High-Dose [Sanofi Pasteur]) is an alternative inactivated vaccine for people 65 years of age and older. Patients with high-risk factors should discuss flu symptoms and when to use antiviral medications; doctors should provide a prescription for the antiviral drug for the patient to use if the patient is exposed to flu or develops flu-like symptoms without having to go in to see the doctor. ""Watchful waiting"" was added as a response to taking antiviral medications, with the emphasis on the fact that those people who develop fever and have a preexisting health condition should then begin the antiviral medication. The antiviral medications are the first-line medicines for treatment of novel H1N1, H3N2, and H3N2v flu, and many viruses are to date susceptible to Tamiflu, Relenza, Rapivab, and Xofluza."
Is it possible to prevent swine flu if the swine flu vaccine (or other flu strain vaccines) is not readily available?,"'Although vaccination is the best way to prevent the swine flu, there may be times in the future when the swine ''flu vaccine'"" may not be available. There are no shortages of the trivalent flu vaccine that contains H1N1 antigens. However, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, this situation did occur so people wanted to know what they could do to protect themselves. If, in the future, vaccine supplies do not meet demands, there are some things people can do to try and prevent infection. Without vaccination, the best strategy is to not allow any virus type to contact a person's ""'mucus''. Quarantining any virus-infected people is an extreme measure that may work in some instances (for example, China used this method), but even with quarantining, the virus may still spread by people who have minimal or no symptoms.''The next step, that is easier to be implemented by individuals, is for people with the disease to self-quarantine until they become noninfectious (about seven to 10 days after flu symptoms abate). Infected people can wear surgical masks to reduce the amount of droplet spray from ''coughs'' and sneezes and throw away contaminated tissues. Unfortunately, these approaches depend on the compliance of many other people, and the likelihood that such methods will be highly successful in preventing flu virus infections, at best, is only fair. Such methods did not stop the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, although they may have some benefit for a few individuals.'""Yet there are still some other methods available to individuals. Perhaps the best way for individuals to try to prevent flu virus infection is a combination of methods that are aimed at fulfilling the very basic principle that if the virus doesn't reach an individual's mucus membrane cells, infection will be prevented. The methods are as follows:""'These six steps can help prevent individuals from getting H1N1 and other types of infection, but for many people, adherence to them may be difficult at best. However, there are some additional strategies that may also help prevent viral infections in unvaccinated people according to some investigators. Saline nasal washes and gargling with saline (or a commercial product) as a way to reduce or eliminate viral virus from mucus membranes has been suggested. Proponents of these methods base their rationale on the fact that flu viruses usually take about two to three days to proliferate in nasal/throat cells. While nasal washes and gargling may be soothing to some people, there are no studies that indicate H1N1 or other viruses are killed, inactivated, or completely removed by these methods; conversely, there are no data suggesting these methods cannot have any effect on H1N1. However, with long-term nasal washes using Neti pots, ''sinus infection'' with other pathogens may be encouraged.''Other investigators and physicians have offered additional methods that may help reduce exposure to H1N1 virus. For example, Dr. Gerberding, a former CDC director, had several suggestions about how to avoid H1N1 infection on an airplane. She suggested the following:''Variations of her suggestions may be applicable in many different social or work, or travel situations, but there are no data to prove these methods are effective. In addition, common-sense precautions such as not drinking or eating things touched by others, avoiding casual physical contacts (for example, handshakes, social hugs or kisses, public water fountains [these are OK if you touch nothing and lips only touch flowing water], banisters on stairways, and restroom door handles) will limit exposure to H1N1 and other viruses. Again, these common-sense suggestions lack data substantiation.''Many investigators suggest that people stay well hydrated, take ''vitamins'"", and get plenty of rest, but these precautions will not prevent H1N1 or other viral infections, although they may help reduce the effects of infection by strengthening the person's immune system to fight infection. Similarly, current antiviral medications (described in the preceding section) act on H1N1 and other viruses that have already infected cells; they work by preventing or reducing viral particles from aggregating and being released from infected cells. Timing is important; if only a few cells are infected and the antiviral medications are administered quickly (usually before flu symptoms develop or within 48 hours), the viruses are reduced in number (they cannot easily bud out from the cell surface), so few, if any, other respiratory or mucus membrane cells become infected. This can result in either no flu symptoms or, if a larger number of cells were initially infected, less severe symptoms. The overall effect for the person is that the H1N1 or other viral infection was prevented (it was not; the symptoms were prevented from developing) or that symptoms were reduced.""'In the strictest sense of the word prevention, even effective vaccines do not ""prevent"" infections. What they do accomplish is to alert the immune system to be on guard for certain antigens that are associated with a specific disease-causing agent (for example, H1N1 virus, pneumococcal bacteria). When the agent first infects the host, its antigens are recognized, and these cause a rapid immune response to occur that prevents the pathogen from spreading and developing symptoms in the host. People, including physicians and researchers, often term this complex response to vaccination as ""prevention of infection,"" but what actually occurs is the prevention of further infection so well that symptoms do not develop or are minimal in the host.'""In summary, if H1N1 or other viruses fail to contact cells they can infect, the disease will be prevented. As stated above, this is difficult, but not impossible, to do in almost all societies. Prevention of flu symptoms of infection is possible with antiviral medications if these are given very early in the infection. There are many other methods that may reduce the chance of getting the virus on a person's mucosal surface, but most methods have not been backed up with objective data. Most doctors and investigators suggest that items that help boost or allow the immune response to function well will help people resist H1N1 and other viral infections and reduce symptoms, but these also do not prevent infections. Consequently, while waiting for a specific antiviral vaccine to be developed or become available, there are some ways individuals can improve their chances of preventing or reducing the ""'symptoms of flu'' virus infections. All of these suggestions apply to H3N2v-caused swine flu as well. Because H3N2v flu has been more closely related to pigs, pig farming and county fairs, people who are at higher risk (see above) should avoid contacting pigs in these settings.' Kill or inactivate the virus before it reaches a human cell by using soap and water to clean your hands; washing clothing and taking a shower will do the same for the rest of your body. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available, and use sanitizers on objects that many people may touch (for example, doorknobs, computer keyboards, handrails, phones), although some researchers suggest that such sanitizers are generally ineffective. Do not touch your mouth, eyes, nose, unless you first do items 1 or 2 above. Avoid crowds, parties, and especially people who are coughing and sneezing (most virus-containing droplets do not travel more than 4 feet, so experts suggest 6 feet away is a good distance to stay). If you cannot avoid crowds (or parties), try to remain aware of people around you and use the 6-foot rule with anyone coughing or sneezing. Do not reach for or eat snacks out of canisters or other containers at parties. Avoid touching anything within about 6 feet of an uncovered cough/sneeze, because the droplets that contain virus fall and land on anything usually within that range. Studies show that individuals who wear surgical or N95 particle masks may prevent inhalation of some H1N1 virus, but the masks may prevent only about 50% of airborne exposures and offer no protection against surface droplets. However, masks on H1N1 infected people can markedly reduce the spread of infected droplets. If a person is next to you or near (within 6 feet) and is coughing/sneezing, ask the flight attendant to offer the person a mask. If there are available seats 6 feet or more away from the coughing/sneezing person, ask to change your seat (planes are good means of travel because the air is recirculated through HEPA filters that can capture viruses, but even the filters will not help if people touch areas where droplets have landed; HEPA filters are usually not available in buses, cars, ships, or trains). Turn away from the coughing/sneezing person and turn the air vent toward the person to blow the droplets away from yourself."
Are there home remedies for swine flu?,"'There are many flu ""cures"" and ""treatments"" described on the Internet (for example, how cayenne pepper, menthol, or ''ginseng'' can be used to treat the flu); before using any of these substances, check with a doctor. However, there are many over-the-counter medications, such as ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'' and others) and ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), to reduce fever and discomfort, lozenges to sooth a ''sore throat'', and decongestants to help manage mucus production and coughing. These medications help manage flu symptoms but do not cure the viral disease.' "
Was swine flu (H1N1) a cause of an epidemic or pandemic in the 2009-2010 flu season?,"'Yes. An epidemic is defined as an outbreak of a contagious disease that is rapid and widespread, affecting many individuals at the same time. The swine flu outbreak in Mexico fit this definition. A pandemic is an epidemic that becomes so widespread that it affects a region, continent, or the world. On June 11, 2009, WHO officials determined that H1N1 2009 influenza A swine flu reached WHO level 6 criteria (person-to-person transmission in two separate WHO-determined world regions) and declared a swine flu pandemic, the first flu pandemic in 41 years. The H1N1 flu reached over 200 different countries on every continent except Antarctica in the 2009-2010 flu season; fortunately, the severity of the disease did not increase. The following is the CDC data for mortality and morbidity of the 2009 epidemic in the U.S.: Final estimates were published in 2011 and state that from April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, approximately 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (195,086-402,719), and 12,469 deaths (8,868-18,306) occurred in the United States due to H1N1. An outbreak in India that became widespread in that country lasted until late 2016. However, in 2017 another outbreak occurred.' "
What is the prognosis (outlook) and complications for patients who get swine flu?,"'In general, the majority (about 90%-95%) of people who get the disease feel terrible (see symptoms) but recover with no problems, as seen in patients in Mexico, the U.S., and many other countries.''People with suppressed immune systems historically have worse outcomes than uncompromised individuals; investigators suspect that as swine flu spreads, the mortality rates may rise and be high in this population. Current data suggest that pregnant individuals, children under 2 years of age, young adults, and individuals with any immune compromise or debilitation are likely to have a worse prognosis. Complications of swine flu may resemble severe viral pneumonia or the ''SARS'' (''severe acute respiratory syndrome'' caused by a coronavirus strain) outbreak in 2002-2003 in which the disease spread to about 10 countries with over 7,000 cases, caused over 700 deaths, and had a 10% mortality rate. At the beginning of the pandemic, the numbers of people with ''flu-like'' illness were higher than usual and the illness initially affected a much younger population than the conventional flu. As the pandemic progressed, more young children became infected than usual, but the mortality statistics became more similar to the conventional flu mortality rate, with an older population (especially ages 50-64) having the highest death rate. Pneumonia (viral and secondary bacterial pneumonia), is the most serious complication of the flu as it can cause death. Other complications include sinus and ''ear infections'', ''asthma'' exacerbations, and/or ''bronchitis''.' "
Where can I find more information about swine flu (H1N1 and H3N2v)?,"'For additional information see the following:''""Pregnant Women & Influenza (Flu),"" CDC''""Influenza A (H3N2) Variant Virus,"" CDC' "
Facts you should know about the influenza vaccine (flu shot)," Types of influenza (flu) vaccines include the injection (killed virus), recombinant (made without flu virus), and nasal spray vaccines (containing live virus). Each year, influenza viruses change slightly, making the seasonal vaccine used in previous years ineffective. The vaccine is generally effective against the influenza virus within two weeks of administration. The vaccine is only effective against the strains of the virus that match the vaccine. The seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness is dependent upon the extent of the match between the virus strains used to prepare the vaccine and those viruses in actual circulation in the community. The age and health status of the individual also play a role in determining the vaccine effectiveness."
What is influenza (flu)?,"'The flu (or common flu) is a viral infection that spreads from person to person in secretions of the nose and ''lungs'', for example when ''sneezing''. Medically, the common flu is another name for influenza. Flu is a ''respiratory infection'', that is, an infection that develops primarily in the lungs. People often call respiratory infections caused by other viruses the flu, but this is incorrect. These other infections are usually categorized as URIs (upper respiratory infections) and have multiple causes. Influenza usually causes higher ''fever'', more malaise, and severe body aches than other respiratory infections. Although other viruses may cause these ''flu-like symptoms'', they do so less frequently.''Influenza viruses are divided scientifically into three types, designated A, B, and C. Influenza types A and B are responsible for epidemics of respiratory illness that occur almost every winter. Influenza type C usually causes either a very mild respiratory illness or no symptoms at all; it does not cause epidemics and does not have the severe public health impact of influenza types A and B. ''Type A'' viruses are divided into subtypes and are named based on differences in two viral surface proteins called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are 16 known H subtypes and nine known N subtypes.''The flu is a common illness. The CDC reports for the 2018/2019 influenza season show that in the United States''The so-called ''swine flu'' pandemic of 2009 was caused by a novel influenza A virus designated ''H1N1'' based upon its surface protein types. This virus was originally referred to as swine flu because many of the genes in this new virus were very similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America. However, this virus was actually quite different from the typical swine flu viruses found in pigs.' 5%-20% of the population gets the flu, nearly 500,000 people are hospitalized from flu-related complications, about 34,000 people die from the flu or its complications."
Why vaccinate for the flu?,"'The flu is highly infectious and is a potentially serious viral ''respiratory infection'' that can even be life threatening. Whereas with other viral respiratory infections the symptoms usually are mild and most people can continue working or going to school while ill, with the flu, the symptoms are severe and prolonged and cause individuals to miss days of work or school. The infection stresses the body. In addition, superinfections may occur as a complication of the flu. Superinfections are ''bacterial infections'' that occur on top of a respiratory infection. Bacterial respiratory infections also are a serious type of infection, and the simultaneous viral and bacterial infection can overwhelm the function of the lungs and the body. Among the elderly and the very young, it can cause death. Because of its infectiousness, morbidity (severity of symptoms and time lost from work or school), and the potential for death, it is important to prevent the flu by influenza vaccination. Although there are medications to treat the flu, they are expensive, not as effective as influenza vaccination, and need to be started within 24-48 hours of the start of symptoms.'  "
What are the different types of flu vaccines?,"'Flu ''vaccines'' are routinely available for seasonal influenza. Pandemic vaccines may also be developed for specific strains of the flu virus that cause widespread disease, such as occurred with the H1N1 virus in 2009.''Each year, composition of the influenza viruses changes, making the vaccine used in previous years ineffective. Each year, a new vaccine must be prepared that will be effective against the types of influenza virus that are expected to circulate in the upcoming influenza season. These are known as seasonal flu vaccines. The reason for the differences in circulating strains of the flu virus is that the virus can mutate (or change its structure) rapidly, leading to new subtypes of the virus. The key is to be able to predict which influenza viruses are going to cause infection and to prepare a vaccine against those viruses. Usually, scientists can predict accurately which types of influenza virus will cause infections and prepare an appropriate vaccine. Typically, the viruses used to prepare flu vaccine are grown in eggs, but a newer, egg-free version of the vaccine has been developed. In 2017, updated guidelines from the Influenza Vaccine and Egg ''Allergy'' Practice Parameter Workgroup commissioned by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) stated that the risk is so small that even asking patients about egg ''allergy'' is no longer necessary. Health care professionals can now safely administer flu vaccines to people who are ''allergic'' to eggs. Flu viruses may also be made using recombinant technology that does not involve growing the actual flu virus in eggs.''The vaccine is generally effective against the influenza virus within two weeks of administration. The vaccine is only effective against the strains of the virus that match the vaccine. These strains vary from flu season to flu season each year. This is the reason that revaccination is required annually with the vaccine that matches the strains of influenza that are currently prevalent.''Flu vaccine is an inactivated vaccine, meaning that it contains killed influenza virus, or a recombinant vaccine, meaning that it was made without using virus particles at all. Health care providers inject the vaccine into muscles or skin, stimulating the immune system to produce an immune response (antibodies) to the influenza virus.''Medical professionals administer the ""flu shot"" vaccine as a single dose of liquid injected through the skin into muscle (intramuscular or IM). Typically, health care professionals inject the flu vaccine into the deltoid muscle at the side of the arm, using ''alcohol'' rubbed over the skin for sterilization. Health care professionals administer the vaccine annually, each fall. Side effects of the flu vaccine are uncommon.''Two types of vaccines are available: a trivalent vaccine that targets three strains of flu virus, as well as a quadrivalent vaccine that targets four strains. Both the trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines are available as an intramuscular injection. Special vaccines preparations are available for people over 65 years of age that produce a stronger immune response.''The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends the use of injectable influenza vaccines (either trivalent or quadrivalent, including inactivated influenza vaccines and recombinant influenza vaccines) or the nasal spray vaccine for the influenza season of 2019-20.''The nasal-spray flu vaccine (sometimes called LAIV for live attenuated influenza vaccine, brand name ''FluMist'') was first licensed in 2003. It is directed against the same strains of virus as the flu shot but differs in that it contains weakened live influenza viruses instead of killed viruses and is administered by nasal spray instead of injection. The vaccine is termed an attenuated vaccine because the vaccine viruses are weakened so that they themselves do not cause severe ''flu symptoms''. The nasal spray flu vaccine is approved for use in non-''pregnant'' individuals 2-49 years old. It should not be used for people with certain underlying medical conditions. All LAIV are quadrivalent (four-component).''The live viruses in the nasal-spray vaccine are weakened so that they do not cause severe symptoms. However, mild symptoms can occur as a side effect of the vaccination. Side effects of the nasal-spray flu vaccine can includedrunny nose, ''headache'', ''sore throat'', and ''cough''. Children who receive the vaccine may also develop mild ''fever'' and muscle aches.' "
What flu viruses does the flu vaccine protect against?,"'Flu vaccines are developed each year and are designed to protect against the influenza viruses that are predicted to be the most common during the upcoming season. Some vaccines contain three viral strains (trivalent), while others contain four virus types (quadrivalent).' "
How does the flu vaccine work to prevent the flu?,"'The flu vaccines stimulate the immune system to produce of antibodies in the body that fight the particular flu virus in the vaccination. When the virus enters a vaccinated person, the antibodies attack and kill the virus and prevent infection. Antibodies are produced against the specific strains of the virus contained in the yearly vaccine.''Flu vaccination does not protect against infection caused by microbes other than the influenza virus.' "
Will the flu vaccine help fight the coronavirus?,"'The coronavirus (''SARS''-CoV-2) and influenza are two different illnesses caused by different viruses. The flu shot will not help fight coronavirus infection, but getting a flu shot remains an important step in protecting your health and in reducing the overall burden of respiratory illness in the community. Having enough people vaccinated against the flu ensures that hospitals and clinics keep adequate space to treat patients with coronavirus infections. It is expected that both the coronavirus and the flu may be present at the same time in the 2020-21 flu season, and being vaccinated against the flu helps protect yourself and vulnerable populations against an illness that might happen at the same time as a coronavirus infection.' "
Can you get COVID-19 and the flu at the same time?,"'According to the CDC, ""While it\'s not possible to say with certainty what will happen in the fall and winter (of 2020-21), CDC believes it\'s likely that flu viruses and the virus that causes ''COVID-19'' will both be spreading. In this context, getting a flu vaccine will be more important than ever."" There is no evidence to suggest that it is not possible to have both diseases at the same time.' "
Is it safe to have a coronavirus vaccine if you already had a flu vaccine?,"'There is no coronavirus vaccine currently available, but vaccine developers are working to ensure development of a vaccine that is safe for everyone, including those who have had flu shots. Currently in the absence of a coronavirus vaccine, it is especially important for the 2020-21 flu season to receive a flu shot for its overall health benefits.' "
When should one receive the flu vaccine?,'Health care professionals recommend getting the influenza vaccination before flu season begins in your community. It takes about two weeks for the vaccine to produce a sufficient antibody response against the flu. Flu season can begin in October and last as late as May.' 
Who should receive the flu vaccine?,"'The CDC recommends that every individual over 6 months of age receive the seasonal flu vaccine. While everyone should get a vaccination, it is particularly important for some groups. Vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications if they get the flu, such as those with ''asthma'', ''diabetes'', and chronic lung disease as well as pregnant women and those over 65 years of age. It is also important for caregivers to get ''vaccinations'', in addition to those who live with people in these risk groups.' "
Who should not receive the flu vaccine?,"'Those who should avoid the flu vaccine include the following:' People who have ever had a severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine People with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome (a severe paralytic illness, also called GBS) that occurred after receiving influenza vaccine and who are not at risk for severe illness from influenza should generally not receive vaccine. People under 65 years of age should not receive the high-dose flu shot. If you are sick with a fever when you go to get your flu shot, you should talk to your doctor or nurse about whether or not you should get your shot later. However, you can get a flu shot at the same time you have a respiratory illness without fever or if you have another mild illness."
What are flu vaccine risks and side effects? Can the flu vaccine give me the flu?,"'Serious side effects of the flu vaccine are uncommon. Side effects of the injection vaccine include soreness at the site of the injection, muscle aching, fever, and feeling unwell. Very rarely, people have reported serious allergic reactions. The viruses in the nasal spray vaccine are weakened and do not cause severe symptoms; they cannot cause you to get the flu. Side effects from the nasal spray may include ''runny nose'', mild fever, ''sore throat'', ''cough'', muscle aches, ''headache'', and ''vomiting''.''Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an illness characterized by fever, nerve damage, and muscle ''weakness''. In 1976, vaccination with the swine flu vaccine was associated with development of GBS. Studies have evaluated if other flu vaccines were associated with GBS, with only one of the studies showing an association. That single study suggested that one person out of 1 million vaccinated people may be at risk of GBS associated with the vaccine.'

What should I do about adverse reactions to the flu vaccine?,'You should contact your health care professional in the case of any serious side effects. Mild side effects such as soreness at the injection site typically resolve on their own without treatment.' 
How effective is the flu vaccine (flu shot)?,"'The effectiveness of the flu vaccine is dependent upon the extent of the match between the virus strains used to prepare the vaccine and those viruses in actual circulation. The age and health status of the individual also play a role in determining the effectiveness of the vaccine. While vaccine effectiveness can vary, recent studies show vaccine reduces the risk of flu illness by about 40%-60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are similar to those used in the vaccines. Similar reductions in the number of people hospitalized with the flu have also been observed. Rates of flu prevention may be even higher in healthy adults under 65 years of age.' "
What was the novel H1N1 (swine flu) vaccine?,"'The H1N1 vaccine was a pandemic vaccine designed to provide immunity against the novel H1N1 flu outbreak in 2009, initially referred to as swine flu. Initially, health care providers gave the H1N1 vaccine to those at highest risk for complications of this illness (children, pregnant women, caregivers of children). Even though the virus proved not to be as deadly as expected, researchers suggest the H1N1 vaccine was effective in reducing the effects of this flu virus.' "
What is the best way to locate a flu vaccine clinic?,"""People can obtain flu shots through a health care professional's office, at community health departments, and at many pharmacies. Additionally, many employers and schools host flu shot clinics. Some employers may offer the vaccine free of charge. A health care professional's office should be able to provide information about flu shot clinics available in the community."" "
What is the common cold?,"'The ''common cold'' is a viral infection of the upper respiratory system (nose, throat, sinuses, Eustachian tubes, trachea, larynx, and bronchial tubes). About 30%-50% of colds are caused by rhinoviruses; however, more than 200 different viruses may cause the ''common cold''. Colds are ''contagious'"" and can be transmitted from person to person. Colds have an incubation period of about one to seven days (time from infection to appearance of symptoms). A cold's duration (how long it lasts) is about seven to 10 days; however, depending upon the viral strain, it can last up to two weeks. Colds are considered mainly to be a mild respiratory illness."" "
What is influenza?,"'Influenza'' (commonly termed the flu) is a viral infection of the upper respiratory and/or lower respiratory system caused by ''influenza'' viruses. These viruses usually cause more serious symptoms in the respiratory system than cold-causing viruses. The flu is ''contagious'"", can be transmitted from person to person, and has an incubation period of about one to four days. The flu's duration varies from about five days to two weeks depending upon the severity of the infection. The flu can become an intense and potentially fatal illness in some individuals."" "
What are causes and risk factors of a cold and the flu?,"'The causes of the flu are mainly influenza viruses belonging to either influenza A or influenza B types of viruses. The causes of colds are usually rhinoviruses, but over 200 types of viruses are capable of causing the ''common cold''. Risk factors for the common cold and flu are similar or identical. Risk factors include the following:' Contact with a person who has either a cold or the flu -- especially contact with mucus membranes, saliva, and/or items that an infected person has touched (for example, towels, toothbrushes, and cups) Contact with other objects that may be touched by an infected person such as handrails, doorknobs, and other high-use items Risk is increased in individuals with compromised immune systems. In general, the young and the old are usually more susceptible to these viruses. Stress, smoking, and lack of sleep can increase your risk for getting these viral infections. Individuals who do not receive the yearly flu vaccine are more likely to risk getting infected with a flu virus; unfortunately, because of the huge number of viruses that may cause a cold, there is no vaccine available commercially against the cold viruses."
How can someone tell the difference between the cold and the flu?,"""As stated previously, sometimes it's difficult, especially in the early stages of infection, to tell the difference between a cold and the flu. However, there are some symptoms, if present, that may help distinguish between colds and the flu. They are summarized in the chart below.""'The above table shows the difficulty in diagnosing colds vs. flu using only symptoms; the best way is to do a short test for flu viruses done by trained medical caregivers.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a cold and the flu?,"'The signs and symptoms of a cold or the flu are outlined in the table above. The ''flu symptoms'' are usually more intense than those seen in colds (moderate to severe) and can come on quickly after exposure to the viruses that cause the flu (for example, the ''swine flu'' virus ''strains'""). In addition, colds don't typically cause death, but the flu is noted to cause death due to respiratory failure in some people."" "
When should I call the doctor about my cold or the flu?,"'If a person develops trouble ''breathing'', has a severe ''sore throat'', has a ''cough'' that produces green-colored mucus, has ''chest pain'', or develops a high and persistent ''fever'', that person should be seen by their doctor. If you suspect you have the flu and are ''pregnant'', are over 50, have a weakened immune system for any reason, or have ongoing medical problems such as ''diabetes'', you are at higher risk for developing complications due to the flu and should contact your physician. If you have a child under 2 years of age or have a friend or relative living in long-term care facility with ''flu-like symptoms'', their doctors need to be notified.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose a cold and/or the flu?,"'Generally, health care professionals distinguish between the cold and the flu by ''running'' a rapid influenza diagnostic test, usually done within about 30 minutes. Depending on which test is used, the results can vary but most health care practitioners, including ''emergency medicine'' personnel, utilize this test. If the test is negative, patients probably have a cold unless their symptoms and signs become more severe.' "
"What are treatments, medicines, and home remedies for the common cold and the 
flu?","'Treatment options, medicines, and home remedies for the common cold and flu are almost exactly the same except for a few items that pertain to the more severe disease, the flu.'  Common treatments for both diseases include rest and treatment of symptoms as they occur; fever is treated with acetaminophen. Symptoms can be managed with good hydration and over-the-counter cold/flu medications that include suppression of symptoms such as cough, congestion, nausea, and sore throat. Medicines are usually over-the-counter cold/flu treatments that often are combinations of several drugs like acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Motrin), various cough suppressants, and/or decongestants; for the flu, some health care providers use drugs of the antiviral/neuraminidase inhibitor class (oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir), especially in severe infections. Home remedies for colds and the flu are similar; vitamin C, zinc, humidified air, steamy showers, gargling with saltwater, compresses to relieve sinus congestion and/or headaches, honey and lemon, ginger, and many other items have been recommended. It is best to check with your physician, especially if you have the flu, before relying on home remedies -- the home remedies mainly reduce symptoms but do not cure the diseases."
What is the prognosis for the common cold and the flu?,"'In most individuals, the prognosis for the common cold and the flu are good to excellent. However, individuals with moderate to severe flu may have a fair to poor prognosis, depending upon how quickly the patient is diagnosed and treated. The poor prognosis for some severe flu infections is usually due to respiratory problems that become complicated to treat (for example, ''pneumonia'') and may require hospitalization in an intensive care unit (ICU).' "
Is it possible to prevent the common cold or the flu?,"""Yes, it is possible to prevent the common cold or the flu, but it is not easy to do so if you live in crowded conditions where it's almost impossible to constantly avoid contact with any items touched by individuals with a common cold or the flu. The ways to prevent (or more realistically, reduce the chance of getting) the common cold and/or the flu are essentially the same. Strict hand washing and avoiding close contact with infected individuals and/or the items they touch is the most effective way to prevent or reduce the chance of infection with the viruses that cause these diseases. Vaccination with the yearly updated ""'flu vaccine'' is another way to prevent or reduce the chance of infection with influenza viruses. Unfortunately, there is no ''vaccine'' against the 200-plus virus types that cause the common cold.' "
What are antinuclear antibodies?,"'We normally have antibodies in our blood that repel invaders in our bodies, such as virus and bacteria microbes. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are unusual antibodies, detectable in the blood, that have the capability of binding to certain structures within the nucleus of the cells. The nucleus is the innermost core within the body\'s cells and contains the DNA, the primary genetic material. ANAs are found in patients whose immune system may be predisposed to cause inflammation against their own body tissues. Antibodies that are directed against one\'s own tissues are referred to as autoantibodies. The propensity for the immune system to work against its own body is referred to as autoimmunity. ANAs suggest the possible presence of autoimmunity. Therefore, when they are detected in a patient\'s blood (referred to as a ""positive"" result), doctors will consider the possibility that an autoimmune illness exists in that patient.''Autoimmune diseases are conditions in which there is a disorder of the immune system characterized by the abnormal production of antibodies (autoantibodies) directed against the tissues of the body. Autoimmune diseases typically feature inflammation of various tissues of the body. Frequently, ANAs are found in patients with a number of different autoimmune diseases, such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'"", Sjögren's syndrome, ""'rheumatoid arthritis'', ''polymyositis'', ''scleroderma'"", Hashimoto's ""'thyroiditis'', juvenile ''diabetes mellitus'', Addison disease, ''vitiligo'', ''pernicious anemia'', glomerulonephritis, and ''pulmonary fibrosis''. ANAs can also be found in patients with conditions that are not considered classic autoimmune diseases, such as chronic infections and ''cancer''.' "
Who created the ANA test? How do health care professionals perform the procedure?,"'The ANA test was designed by Dr. George Friou in 1957. The ANA test is performed using a blood sample. An ANA test is performed by testing the blood in the laboratory. The antibodies in the serum of the blood are exposed in the laboratory to cells. It is then determined whether or not antibodies are present that react to various parts of the nucleus of cells. Thus, the term anti-""nuclear"" antibody. Fluorescence techniques are frequently used to actually detect the antibodies in the cells, thus ANA testing is sometimes referred to as fluorescent antinuclear antibody test (FANA).' "
What is the interpretation of the ANA screen result?,"'The ANA test is a sensitive screening test used to detect autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases feature a misdirected immune system, and each of them has characteristic clinical manifestations that are used to make the precise diagnosis. The interpretation or identification of a positive ANA test does not make a diagnosis. It simply suggests to the doctor to consider the possibility that an autoimmune disease is present.'  "
What non-autoimmune conditions produce ANAs?,"'ANAs can be produced in patients with infections (virus or bacteria), lung diseases (primary ''pulmonary fibrosis'', ''pulmonary hypertension''), gastrointestinal diseases (''ulcerative colitis'"", Crohn's disease, ""'primary biliary cirrhosis'', alcoholic ''liver disease'""), hormonal diseases (Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroiditis, """"Grave's disease""'), blood diseases (''idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura'', hemolytic ''anemia''), ''cancers'' (''melanoma'', breast, lung, kidney, ovarian and others), skin diseases (''psoriasis'', pemphigus), as well as in the elderly and those people with a family history of rheumatic diseases.'  "
Can medications cause elevated ANAs?,"'Many medications can sometimes stimulate the production of ANAs, including ''procainamide'' (Procan SR), ''hydralazine'' (''Apresoline''), and ''phenytoin'' (''Dilantin''). ANAs that are stimulated by medication are referred to as drug-induced ANAs. This does not necessarily mean that any disease is present when these ANAs are ""induced."" Sometimes diseases are associated with these ANAs, and they are referred to as drug-induced diseases.' "
ANAs are defined as having patterns. What does this mean?,"'ANAs present different ""patterns"" depending on the staining of the cell nucleus in the laboratory: homogeneous or diffuse pattern; speckled pattern; nucleolar pattern; and peripheral or rim pattern. While these patterns are not specific for any one illness, certain illnesses can more frequently be associated with one pattern or another. The patterns then can sometimes give the doctor further clues as to types of illnesses to look for in evaluating a patient. For example, the nucleolar pattern is more commonly seen in the disease ''scleroderma''. The speckled pattern is seen in many conditions and in people who do not have any autoimmune disease. These patterns are determined by technical experts who routinely interpret the tests.' "
Are ANAs always associated with illness? What is the normal range?,"""No. ANAs can be found in approximately 5% of the normal population, usually in low titers (low levels). These people usually have no disease. Titers of 1:80 or lower are less likely to be significant. (ANA titers of less than or equal to 1:40 are considered negative.) Even higher titers are often insignificant in patients over 60 years of age. Ultimately, the ANA result must be interpreted in the specific context of an individual patient's symptoms, underlying medical conditions, and other test results. It may or may not be significant, even if positive, in a given individual."" "
What is a breast biopsy?,"'A breast biopsy is a procedure in which part or all of a suspicious area in the breast is removed and examined, usually for the presence of ''breast cancer''. The growth sample is suctioned out through a needle or cut out using a surgical procedure. A pathologist then examines and evaluates it under a microscope to identify noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (''malignant'') tissue.''Words used to refer to the abnormal area or growth before and after diagnosis may include lump, mass, lesion, calcification, and ''tumor''.''Imaging studies such as ''mammography'', ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI), or ultrasound may be used to guide the procedure, known as an image-guided breast biopsy. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses a special mammography machine to help guide the biopsy equipment to the site of the breast abnormality.''The following are the different types of breast biopsy procedures:'   Fine-needle aspiration (FNA): A thin needle suctions out cells from an abnormal area; a physician examines the cells to see if cancer cells are present. Hollow or core needle biopsy: This thicker needle is used to remove a small cylinder of tissue from the abnormal area. Biopsy with a vacuum-powered device Surgical excision of tissue: This may be an excisional biopsy, in which all the abnormal area is excised or removed, or an incisional biopsy, which removes only a portion of the abnormal area for examination by the pathologist."
What is the purpose of a breast biopsy?,"'The breast biopsy is used to determine whether or not a worrisome abnormality or area of calcification is ''cancer'' and, if it is ''cancer'', what type it is and how to develop a treatment plan. When no ''breast cancer'' is detected, the diagnosis of a benign or harmless lump is reassuring. The percentage of breast biopsies that are positive for cancer varies according to the individual hospital or clinic, but in general, only about 20% of ''breast lumps'' are cancerous. The majority of breast biopsies do not detect cancer.' "
"What specialties of physicians and 
other health care professionals perform breast biopsies?","'Many physicians and health care professionals can be involved in evaluating a woman for a breast biopsy.' For example, breast abnormalities during a physical examination might be noticed by a family physician, internist, gynecologist, or nurse practitioner. Women themselves are frequently the first to detect abnormalities in their breasts. Radiologists are specialists in interpreting X-rays such as mammograms, as well as other imaging studies. Radiologists or surgeons often perform the procedure to obtain these breast tissue samples. Anesthesiologists (specialists in administering anesthesia and monitoring a patient's vital signs) are sometimes necessary during some surgical procedures. Pathologists are physician specialists who examine and identify under a microscope the type of cells in the samples and determine whether or not cancer is present."
Who should have a breast biopsy?,"'Anyone, female or male, with a suspicious breast growth, abnormality detected on imaging study, or other ''symptoms of breast cancer'' should undergo a biopsy. Ninety-nine percent of all breast ''cancers'' occur in females, however, males can and do get breast cancer. Therefore, men should regularly examine their breasts as females do for lumps or other ''cancer symptoms''. (Males with the ''genetic disorder'' ''Klinefelter syndrome'', which is associated with increased breast development, have approximately the same risk of developing breast cancer as females.)'  "
In what setting is the breast biopsy done?,"""Breast biopsies are performed in the doctor's office, an outpatient facility, or a hospital operating room. The setting depends on the size and location of the growth, the patient's general health, and the type of biopsy performed. Because physicians can perform biopsies in a short time with minimal risk of serious complications, the patient usually does not need to remain hospitalized overnight unless an underlying health problem requires close monitoring. A stereotactic breast biopsy uses mammography images to guide the location of the biopsy. Ultrasound or MRI imaging may also be used to guide the breast biopsy procedure."" "
What may a benign result indicate?,"'Among the most common benign growths in the breast are ''cysts'' (sacs filled with fluid or semisolid material), intraductal papillomas (small wart-like growths that project above a tissue surface), and lumps formed by fat necrosis (the death of tissue often as a result of ''trauma'' to the breast). A fibroadenoma is the most common type of benign (noncancerous) breast tumor and is found in young women.' "
How is a suspicious breast growth discovered?,"""A suspicious breast growth may be found by a patient's self-examination, a physician's clinical examination, or a screening procedure such as a ""'mammogram''. Small calcium deposits, known as calcifications, are often identified in imaging studies of breast cancers and precancers. These may also be present in benign lesions.' "
What breast symptoms should I be concerned about?,"'Females and males (regardless of age) who discover a lump in a breast should see a doctor for testing. They also should see a doctor if they find a lump in an armpit or above a collarbone (either of which could indicate the presence of spreading cancer).''A doctor or health care professional should be consulted if a person has''It is important to remember that these signs and symptoms do not necessarily indicate the presence of cancer.' red or irritated breast skin, scaly skin on the breast, dimpling skin on the breast, swelling breast skin, nipple discharge other than milk, nipple retraction or inversion, nipple itching, a change in the size or shape of a breast, or breast pain."
What should the patient tell the doctor about the growth?,"'The patient should tell the health care professional when the growth appeared, what its size was at the time of discovery compared to its present size, and where it is located. The patient should also outline any family history of breast cancer, as well as any personal history of breast problems of any kind.' "
How does a health care professional confirm the presence of a breast growth?,"'A physician confirms the presence of a growth by taking a medical history (and asking numerous questions), performing a clinical examination that includes palpating (feeling) the breast, and interpreting the results of a diagnostic mammogram and sometimes other imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI.''Ultrasound sends sound waves into the breast that bounce back to a receiver that can record an image on a computer screen to visualize interior structures. This technique can help distinguish between a ''cyst'' and a solid growth. The physician may also order the laboratory analysis of any nipple discharge (other than milk) to examine for the presence of atypical or cancer cells. After confirming the presence of a suspicious growth or mass, the physician orders a biopsy.' "
"Is anesthesia needed for a 
breast biopsy?","'For nonsurgical biopsies, the patient may need no anesthesia at all or just a local anesthetic (one that numbs the suspicious area only). Sometimes, a patient receives a sedative (calming drug) with the local anesthesia.''For surgical biopsies, the patient may receive a local anesthetic (with or without a sedative) or general anesthesia (one that induces ''sleep''). Patients requiring general anesthesia may have to fast eight to 12 hours before undergoing a biopsy.' "
What are the possible complications from a breast biopsy?,"'Except for a minor sting from the injected anesthesia, patients usually feel no ''pain'' before or during a procedure.''The risk of complications, such as infection and bleeding, is small for nonsurgical procedures and slightly higher for surgical procedures.' "
How long is the recovery time after breast biopsy?,"'After a procedure, some patients may experience some soreness and ''pain'' as well as ''bruising'' and minor skin discoloration of the breast that usually resolves within a week or so. Usually, an ''over-the-counter'' drug such as ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is sufficient to alleviate any discomfort.' "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of nonsurgical procedures versus surgical breast biopsies?,"'Generally, nonsurgical biopsies are less stressful, do not disfigure the skin, leave no internal ''scar'' to interfere with the accuracy of future mammograms, and minimize the risk of complications.''However, nonsurgical biopsies are not always as reliable as surgical biopsies in producing a diagnosis, and the results at times may be inconclusive. For this reason, some patients who undergo a nonsurgical biopsy must also undergo a follow-up surgical biopsy.' "
What are the different types of breast biopsy procedures and what do they involve?,"'Breast biopsy procedures include''These procedures are described in greater detail later in this article.'   fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and surgical biopsy."
How is a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) done?,"'A fine needle aspiration biopsy can be done in several different ways:''By analyzing the samples immediately after their withdrawal, a doctor may be able to determine that they came from a cyst and simply discard them, diagnosing the growth as benign. In all other cases, fluid and tissue samples are placed on slides and then analyzed by a pathologist in a laboratory. Atypical cells found in a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may signal that cancer is present or that repeat biopsies are necessary.' Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for palpable growths: A palpable growth is one that can be felt. The patient usually sits up while the doctor inserts a small hollow needle with a syringe to withdraw (aspirate) fluid and cells from the growth for testing. The doctor simply feels (palpates) the suspicious area to the needle to the site. When the needle reaches the mass, the doctor suctions out a sample with the syringe. The doctor repeats this procedure several times. If the mass is a cyst, the withdrawn samples will consist mainly of fluid and the cyst may collapse, relieving any pain the patient feels. If the mass is solid, the samples will consist primarily of tissue cells. Guided FNA for non-palpable growths: When a growth is too small or deep to palpate (feel), the doctor must locate it with one of several imaging techniques. First, the patient lies face-down on a table with the breasts suspended through an opening. With stereotactic mammography, mammograms of the suspicious breast site are taken from different angles to form a virtual three-dimensional (stereotactic) image that precisely pinpoints the location of the suspicious area. The computer then uses a motor to guide a small hollow needle to the site to remove the samples. The withdrawn samples are then analyzed for the presence of cancer. Ultrasound and MRI are other imaging techniques that may be used to guide breast biopsies."
How is a core needle biopsy done?,"'A core needle biopsy can also be done in several different ways:' Core needle biopsy for palpable growths: This procedure is similar to FNA for palpable growths except that that the needle used has a wider diameter and is equipped with a cutter that removes cores of tissue up to a ½ inch long. A key advantage of this procedure is that the samples are larger than in FNA and thus enhance the possibility of making an accurate laboratory analysis. Guided core needle biopsy for non-palpable growths: This procedure also uses a wide needle with a cutter that removes cores of tissue large enough to enhance the accuracy of laboratory analysis. However, because the growth is deep in the breast or otherwise not palpable, stereotactic imaging, ultrasound, or MRI is used to locate the growth."
How is a vacuum-assisted breast biopsy done?,"'Vacuum-assisted breast biopsy is procedure that uses a special instrument and imaging guidance to remove breast tissue samples through a single small skin incision. This technique allows the surgeon to remove more tissue through a single incision than is possible with a traditional core biopsy and is a much less invasive procedure than an open surgical biopsy.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy involves the placement of a biopsy probe using radiology imaging studies for guidance. Stereotactic mammography, ultrasound, and MRI have all been successfully used to identify the abnormal areas to be sampled by vacuum-assisted breast biopsy. Once the biopsy probe has been positioned, a vacuum pulls the breast tissue through an opening in the probe into the sampling chamber of the device. Then a rotating cutting device in the instrument removes the tissue sample, which is carried through the biopsy probe to a tissue collection receptacle.''The surgeon or radiologist then turns a control knob on the biopsy probe that moves the sampling chamber to a new position. This procedure is repeated until all desired areas have been sampled. In this way, samples can be taken all around a suspicious area through a single insertion of the biopsy probe. With a traditional core biopsy, sampling of multiple areas would involve repeated insertions of the biopsy instrument.''The vacuum-assisted biopsy procedure is performed under local anesthesia and leaves a small incision that does not require ''stitches'' for closure. It takes less than an hour to perform, and patients can usually return to normal activities soon after the procedure.' "
"How is a 
surgical biopsy of the breast done?","'A surgical biopsy can be an excisional (removing the entire abnormal area) or an incisional (removing only part of the abnormal area) biopsy. The surgical biopsy can be done in different ways:''The doctor closes the opening with ''sutures'' or clips that remain in place for about a week. Patients who receive general anesthesia rather than a local will require about an hour to recover from drowsiness after the surgery.' Surgical biopsy of palpable growths (lumpectomy): This procedure removes part or all of a breast growth, or lump. The doctor makes an incision 1 or 2 inches (about 2.5 to 5 cm) across and removes the sample. If the lump is small and measures 1 inch (2.5 cm) or less across, the doctor usually removes the entire lump for testing (excisional biopsy). If the lump is large, the doctor usually removes only a portion of it for testing (incisional biopsy). If cancer is found, the rest of the lump can be removed at the time of the biopsy or at a later time. Surgical biopsy for non-palpable lumps: This procedure is similar to lumpectomy except that the growth is first located by mammography or other imaging studies and then ""marked."" The doctor inserts a needle that conveys a wire with a hook on the end into the breast, all the while using the image as a guide. After anchoring the hooked wire to the lump, the doctor withdraws the needle and performs the surgery. Another option is to inject a dye to mark the spot rather than using a hooked wire."
What is the time frame for receiving the results of a breast biopsy?,"'For small biopsies and fine-needle aspirations, the results may be available the next day. The results of most breast biopsies will be available within a few days. Sometimes special testing must be performed, and the results may be delayed and take longer. This does not necessarily mean that a cancer is present. For example, sometimes the tissue sections must be recut to reveal deeper layers of the tissue to allow for optimal evaluation by the pathologist. In other cases, special tissue stains may be necessary to help the pathologist assess the tissue sample under the microscope. The radiologist or surgeon performing the procedure will be able to give you a better idea of the approximate time frame and how the result will be communicated to you.' "
What is diabetic neuropathy?,"'Neuropathy is damage to nerves, and diabetic neuropathy is damage to nerves that occurs as a result of diabetes. Diabetes is thought to damage nerves as a result of prolonged elevated levels of blood glucose. Diabetic neuropathy can affect different parts of the body, and symptoms can range from mild to severe. Diabetic neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of diabetic neuropathy?,"'The symptoms and signs of diabetic neuropathy depend upon the type of neuropathy that is present. Signs and symptoms can also vary in severity among affected people.''The symptoms can appear suddenly. It usually does not cause a long term problem, and symptoms often improve over weeks to months. Symptoms can include:'   Numbness or tingling of the feet and lower legs Pain or burning sensations Loss of sensation in the feet or lower legs Sometimes, but less commonly, these symptoms can occur in the hands or arms Pain, usually on one side, in the hips, buttocks, or thighs Weakness of the legs Nausea and/or vomiting Diarrhea Constipation Dizziness Fainting Feeling full after eating a small amount Erectile dysfunction in men Incontinence of urine Inability to empty the bladder completely Decrease in vaginal lubrication in women Profuse sweating, for example when eating or at night Bloating Difficulty swallowing Low blood pressure upon standing up suddenly (orthostatic hypotension) Rapid resting heartbeat Chest pain Eye pain Changes in vision Bell's palsy (paralysis on one side of the face) Pain in a localized area of the body"
What causes diabetic neuropathy?,"'The cause of nerve damage in diabetes is not well understood. Long-term exposure to high levels of blood glucose is able to damage nerve tissue, although the reason for this damage is unclear.' "
Can diabetic neuropathy be reversed?,"'Nerve damage typically cannot be reversed once it has occurred. However, there are medications and self-care measures that can help control the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.' "
What are the types of diabetic neuropathy?,"'There are different types of diabetic neuropathy. The distinction depends upon which types and location of nerves are affected.'   Diabetic peripheral neuropathy refers to damage to peripheral nerves, most commonly the nerves of the feet and legs. Diabetic proximal neuropathy affects nerves in the thighs, hips, or buttocks. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy affects the autonomic nervous system, the nerves that control body functions. For example, it can affect nerves of the gastrointestinal, urinary, genital, or vascular systems. Diabetic focal neuropathy affects a specific nerve or area at any site in the body."
How is diabetic neuropathy diagnosed?,"""Diabetic neuropathy is usually presumptively diagnosed clinically by the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical exam. However, there are other tests that can definitively diagnose the condition by actually measuring the loss of nerve function. Nerve conduction studies measure the speed of nerve signals in the arms and legs, while electromyography measures the electrical discharges produced in muscles. Other tests of nervous system function may be done on some patients. About 45% to 50% of all patients with diabetes are eventually diagnosed with some form of neuropathy."" "
What are treatments for diabetic neuropathy?,"'While diabetic neuropathy cannot be cured, there are treatments available to help manage some of the symptoms. Another treatment goal is keeping blood glucose levels under good control through a combination of ''diet'' and medication so that the neuropathy does not worsen. Keeping blood glucose levels under control has been shown to improve symptoms and prevent worsening of the pain.'  "
What natural home remedies help relieve pain?,"'There are a number of self- and home care measures that you can take to relieve the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. Examples are:'   Using a device known as a bed cradle to keep bedcovers off of sensitive feet and lower legs Using heat or cold patches, but since diabetic neuropathy can damage sensory nerves, care should be taken to avoid burns or freezing Eating small, frequent meals and avoiding fatty foods may help those with digestive symptoms Standing up slowly or wearing elastic compression stockings can improve orthostatic hypotension Exercises, stretching, or massage may help relieve pain"
What medications help relieve the pain from diabetic neuropathy?,"'The pain of diabetic neuropathy can sometimes be managed with certain medications. Certain prescription ''antidepressants'' and antiseizure medications have been shown to be effective in relieving pain that originates in the nerves.''For example:''In severe cases, opioid analgesic medications may be needed.''Medications can also help manage the troublesome symptoms of autonomic neuropathy. For example, antispasmodic or anticholinergic drugs can help prevent urinary ''incontinence''. Drugs to treat ''erectile dysfunction'' like ''sildenafil'' (''Viagra''), ''tadalafil'' (''Cialis''), and ''vardenafil'' (''Levitra'') may help some men with ''ED'' due to diabetic neuropathy. For women, vaginal estrogen creams and lubricants may provide relief of ''vaginal dryness'' and irritation.' duloxetine (Cymbalta) is an antidepressant that can relieve the pain of diabetic neuropathy in some people. The tricyclic antidepressant drugs, including nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl) and desipramine (Norpramin), have also been used for this purpose. Anti-seizure drugs such as gabapentin (Neurontin), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and pregabalin (Lyrica) are drugs that can also work to relieve pain in people with diabetic neuropathy."
Can diabetic neuropathy be prevented?,"'Keeping diabetes under control is the best way to prevent or stop the progression of diabetic neuropathy. Your doctor can advise you about the best target range for your blood glucose levels, and keeping tight control of blood ''sugar'' within this range can help prevent neuropathy and other complications of diabetes. Avoiding ''smoking'', getting ''exercise'', and eating a healthy ''diet'' are other measures that can help people with diabetes have the best long-term outcomes.' "
What is folliculitis? What are the symptoms and signs? ,"'Folliculitis is an inflammatory condition affecting hair follicles. It appears as a small red tender bump occasionally surmounted with dot of pus surrounding a hair. Older lesions that have lost the pus appear as red bumps surrounding the opening of the follicle absent the hair. One to hundreds of follicles can be affected anywhere that hair is present. Actually, ''acne vulgaris'', the facial ''rash'' that teenagers develop, is a type of folliculitis.'  "
Who develops folliculitis?,"'Anyone can develop folliculitis ''rash'' in areas where hair follicles are present on the body. Lesions of folliculitis most frequently involve areas such as the face, scalp, chest, back, buttocks, groin, and thighs. It does not affect the eyes, mouth, palms, or soles, where there are no hair follicles. Folliculitis probably affects all humans to some extent at some time during their lives. Folliculitis never involves the palms, soles, or eyelids because these areas are devoid of hair follicles.''Certain groups of people are more prone to develop folliculitis. People with ''diabetes'' and those with a compromised immune system (such as from ''HIV/AIDS'', ''hepatitis'', chronic diseases, ''cancer'', systemic ''chemotherapy'', immune-suppressing ''drugs'') may be more prone to develop folliculitis.' "
What are the causes of folliculitis?,"'Folliculitis can be caused by a large number of infectious organisms. However, frequently folliculitis is sterile and seems to be induced by irritating chemical substances, drugs, occlusive clothing, and physical irritants like shaving. Differentiating these causes is very important if the physician is going to be able to treat the condition successfully.' "
What else could folliculitis look like?,"'There are a large number of exotic skin problems that may involve inflammation of the hair follicles. It takes an expert to distinguish these. If the condition does not resolve spontaneously, it is wise to visit a doctor.' "
What are common types of folliculitis?,"'Acne'' vulgaris occurs almost universally in teenagers at ''puberty''. ''Acne'' vulgaris is usually not considered a folliculitis, but it specifically affects the hair follicles of the face, chest, and back.''Systemically administered or topically applied steroids (cortisone-containing medications) are a well-known cause of folliculitis. Certain anti-''cancer'' drugs produce a form of folliculitis.''Machinists exposed to insoluble cutting oils that are used to decrease the friction while machining metal parts can develop a folliculitis on the exposed skin.''Staphylococci are bacteria that commonly inhabit the skin. One species, ''S. aureus'', is a frequent cause of folliculitis. Occasionally, this organism may be insensitive to a number of commonly used antibiotics (such as methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'', or ''MRSA''). In this situation, it is very important that a culture of the organism with sensitivities be performed so the ideal antibiotic is selected to treat the infection.''Folliculitis from a fungus infection can occur on the face and on the lower legs. It is often exacerbated by shaving. It can also occur on the trunk (''Pityrosporum ''folliculitis).''Folliculitis from a virus infection often affects the face and is from ''herpes'' simplex virus affecting the lips, commonly known as a ''cold sore''.''There are a variety of rare, inflammatory, scarring types of folliculitis that can result in permanent ''hair loss''.''Eosinophilic folliculitis is an uncommon condition that is poorly understood and occurs occasionally as a response to certain drugs, in immunosuppressed patients (''AIDS'' and bone marrow ''cancers''), and in infants, affecting the scalp.' "
What is razor burn folliculitis?,"'Razor-''burn'"" folliculitis is very common on the male neck and women's legs and is caused by shaving. Repeated passes by the razor produces tiny ""'cuts'' that allow bacteria to enter the skin and invade the deeper hair follicles. Additionally, excessively close shaving may cause trapping of small hairs beneath the skin surface, causing more inflammation. Occasionally waxing (which utilizes warm paraffin that once solidified is then ripped away removing incased hairs) can produce folliculitis.''Treatment involves stopping shaving with a razor for a few days to a few weeks and using antibacterial washes and topical antibiotics. Additional treatments include laser ''hair removal'', ''electrolysis'', electric razors, or cream depilatories like Neet or Nair. Frequently, shaving less vigorously and leaving a small bit of stubble is advisable.' "
What is hot tub folliculitis or Jacuzzi folliculitis?,"'Hot tub folliculitis is most often caused by the bacteria ''Pseudomonas'' aeruginosa''. This bacterial infection is likely to occur from bathing in poorly maintained hot tubs. It is most common on the back and causes scattered pinpoint, small red to purple bumps all over the torso. These may be very ''itchy'' or have no symptoms at all. Typically, there is a history of sitting in a hot tub days prior to the start of the bumps. It is good practice to rinse off the skin in a shower after this sort of bathing.''The hot tub should be tested and possibly treated by trained pool and spa personnel for bacterial overgrowth. Affected patients may be more prone to recurrences in the future and should be cautious about hot tub use. Although this condition often resolves without treatment, it may be useful to rinse the skin with dilute vinegar.' "
What is pseudofolliculitis barbae?,"'Pseudofolliculitis barbae is a very common ''ingrown hair'"" condition on the beard area (lower face and neck) of men. Typically, there are groups of small red bumps on the beard area that may flare with repeat shaving. Pseudofolliculitis tends to be worse with very curly or kinky hair. It can be quite debilitating especially if one's employment requires a closely shaven appearance. Cutting the hair close to or below the follicular orifice results in hairs that penetrate into the follicular wall as they twist and grow. These trapped hairs cause irritation and inflammation at the hair follicles.""'Treatment goals include avoiding overly aggressive shaving, trial of the ""bumps-free razor,"" and antibacterial benzoyl peroxide shaving gels. Other treatment options include professional laser hair removal, electrolysis, electric razors, or a prescription drug called ''eflornithine'' (''Vaniqa'').' "
Is folliculitis contagious?,"'Although most folliculitis is not ''contagious'', folliculitis caused by an infectious agents may be transmitted through person-to-person skin contact, shared razors, or through Jacuzzis or hot tubs. It is possible to give the infection to someone else through close skin contact. Some people are simply more prone to developing folliculitis because of their overall health, possible altered immune status, exposure history, and other predisposing ''skin conditions'' like ''eczema'' or severely ''dry skin''.' "
What tests diagnose folliculitis?,"'The diagnosis of folliculitis is generally based on the appearance of the skin. In some situations, a microbial culture of pus from the ''pustule'' will help to detect an infection. It may be necessary to pull out some of the affected hairs and examine these microscopically using potassium hydroxide in order to detect ''fungal infections'' or other infectious organisms. Occasionally, a small ''skin biopsy'' may be used to help the doctor confirm the diagnosis. Infectious causes include bacteria, fungi, ''viruses'', and parasites. Usually, no specific blood tests are needed in the diagnosis of common folliculitis.'  "
What are the treatment options and home remedies for folliculitis?,"'There are many treatment options and ''skin care'' ''recipes'' for treating folliculitis. The specific treatment depends on the cause of the folliculitis.''Home therapy for mild cases of bacterial folliculitis includes use of an over-the-counter antibacterial wash like benzoyl peroxide (Clearisil, Proactiv), chlorhexidine (Hibiclens), or Phisoderm twice a day. The best results may be achieved with combination therapy using topical products and antibacterial washes.''Holistic treatment for folliculitis may include soaking the affected area in a tub of diluted white vinegar (1 part vinegar to 4 parts of water) or soaking in a bathtub with very diluted Clorox bleach (¼ cup of Clorox bleach in a bathtub full of water).''Bacterial folliculitis may be treated with antibacterial skin washes and topical and/or oral antibiotics. It is important to keep in mind that as with any condition, no therapy is uniformly effective in all people. A doctor may need to help evaluate the cause of the folliculitis.''Moderate cases of bacterial folliculitis may be treated by a routine of twice-daily application of a topical antibiotic, such as ''clindamycin'' lotion or ''metronidazole'' lotion. A five- to 30-day course of an oral antibiotic like ''cephalexin'' (''Keflex''), dicloxacillin (Dynapen), ''doxycycline'', ''minocycline'' (''Dynacin'', ''Minocin''), ''ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro''), or ''levofloxacin'' (''Levaquin'') may be used for folliculitis that is more resistant. After initial clearing with stronger medications, a milder maintenance antibacterial wash and topical antibiotic may be recommended.''Fungal or yeast folliculitis is often treated with an antifungal shampoo or body wash such as ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral'' shampoo) twice daily. More resistant or deeper fungal folliculitis may require the addition of a topical antifungal cream such as ''miconazole'' (Lotrimin) or ''terbinafine'' (''Lamisil'') and an antifungal pill such as ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan'').''Persistent skin discoloration called ''hyperpigmentation'' may be treated with prescription fading creams like hydroquinone 4%, kojic acid, and azelaic acid 15%-20%. Over-the-counter fading creams with 2% hydroquinone like Porcelana may be somewhat effective.'  "
How long does it take folliculitis to heal?,'The individual follicle usually heals rapidly within a few days.' 
Is folliculitis curable?,"'Most cases of folliculitis are completely curable. There are very uncommon, long-standing cases of folliculitis that may not be curable. Often these more resistant cases may be controlled with proper treatment and medication. Folliculitis sometimes clears completely by itself without treatment. Most patients may expect a short course with easy clearing.' "
What are complications of folliculitis?,"'Complications are infrequent since folliculitis is usually a self-limited skin condition. Rarely, the infected bumps may enlarge, causing an ''abscess'' (furuncles or ''carbuncles'') or painful ''cysts'' requiring minor surgical drainage. Deeper or more extensive skin infections called ''cellulitis'' can be a rare complication.''Another potential complication includes temporary skin discoloration called post-inflammatory hypopigmentation (lighter than the regular skin color) or hyperpigmentation (darker then the regular skin color). This altered skin color may occur after the inflamed red bumps have improved or after a temporary flare.''Permanent scarring is uncommon but may occur from picking, overly aggressive scrubbing, or other deep inflammation.' "
Which types of doctors treat folliculitis?,"'Most family physicians, internists, or dermatologists are able to care for folliculitis.' "
What is the prognosis of folliculitis?,"'The prognosis with folliculitis is very good. Overall, folliculitis tends to be an easily treated and curable skin condition. Often, it is a noncontagious, self-limited condition. Rarely, more widespread folliculitis may be cosmetically disfiguring and psychologically distressing.'  "
Can you prevent folliculitis?,"'Prevention'' efforts include good skin hygiene, avoiding unsanitary hot tubs and pools, not sharing razors, avoiding shaving too closely, changing out razors blades regularly, and keeping the skin moist and well hydrated.' "
What is a food allergy?,"'Either food allergy or food intolerance affects nearly everyone at some point. When people have an unpleasant reaction to something they ate, they often think that they have an allergy to the food. Actually, however, research shows that only about 3% of adults and 6%-8% of children have clinically proven true ''allergic'' reactions to food.'""This difference between the prevalence of clinically proven food allergy and the public's perception of the problem is due primarily to misinterpreting food intolerance or other adverse reactions to food as food allergy. A true food allergy is an abnormal response to food (known as a food ""'allergen'') that is triggered by a specific reaction in the immune system and expressed by certain, often characteristic, symptoms. Other kinds of reactions to foods that are not food ''allergies'' include food intolerances (such as lactose or milk intolerance), ''food poisoning'', and toxic reactions. Food intolerance also is an abnormal response to food, and its symptoms can resemble those of food allergy. Food intolerance, however, is far more prevalent, occurs in a variety of diseases, and is triggered by several different mechanisms that are distinct from the immunological reaction responsible for food allergy.''People who have food allergies must identify and prevent them because, although usually mild and not severe, these reactions can cause devastating illness and, in rare instances, can be fatal.'  "
What causes allergic reactions to food?,"'Both heredity and environmental factors may play a role in the development of food allergy. The allergens in food are those ingredients that are responsible for inciting an ''allergic reaction''. They are proteins that usually resist the heat of cooking, the acid in the stomach, and the intestinal ''digestive enzymes''. As a result, the allergens survive to cross the gastrointestinal lining, enter the bloodstream causing (protein-induced) allergic reactions throughout the body. The mechanism of food allergy involves the immune system and heredity.''Immune system'': An allergic reaction to food involves two components of the immune system. One component is a type of protein, an allergy antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE), which circulates through the blood. The other is the mast cell, a specialized cell that stores up histamine and is found in all tissues of the body. The mast cell is particularly found in areas of the body that are typically involved in allergic reactions, including the nose and throat, ''lungs'', skin, and gastrointestinal tract.''Heredity'': The tendency of an individual to produce IgE against something seemingly as innocuous as food appears to be ''inherited''. Generally, people with allergies come from families in which allergies are common -- not necessarily to food but perhaps allergies to ''pollen'', fur, feathers, or ''drugs''. Thus, a person with two allergic parents is more likely to develop food allergies than someone with one allergic parent.''Mechanism'': Food allergy is a hypersensitivity reaction, meaning that before an allergic reaction to an allergen in food can occur, a person needs to have been exposed previously, or ""sensitized,"" to the food. At the initial exposure, the allergen stimulates lymphocytes (specialized white blood cells) to produce the IgE antibody that is specific for the allergen. This IgE then is released and attaches to the surface of the mast cells in different tissues of the body. The next time the person eats that particular food, its allergen hones in on the specific IgE antibody on the surface of the mast cells and prompts the cells to release chemicals such as histamine. Depending upon the tissue in which they are released, these chemicals cause the various symptoms of food allergy.' "
What are food allergy risk factors?,"""Both adults and children may develop food allergies. Factors that increase one's risk of having a food allergy include the following:"" Young age: Food allergies are most common in infants and toddlers. Having a past food allergy as a child or an allergy to another food: Those who are allergic to one type of food are more likely to develop other food allergies. Adults who have outgrown food allergies they had as children are more likely to develop subsequent food allergies than people who have never had them. Family or personal history of allergy, eczema, asthma, or hay fever increases the chances for developing a food allergy."
What are food allergy symptoms and signs?,"'The complex process of digestion affects the timing, location, and particular symptoms of an allergic reaction to food. All of the symptoms of food allergy occur within a few minutes to an hour of eating. A food allergy can initially be experienced as an ''itching'' in the mouth and ''difficulty swallowing'' and breathing. Then, during digestion of the food in the stomach and ''intestines'', symptoms such as ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', and ''abdominal pain'' can start. Incidentally, the gastrointestinal symptoms of food allergy are those that are most often confused with the symptoms of different types of food intolerance.''As mentioned previously, the allergens are absorbed and enter the bloodstream. When they reach the skin, allergens can induce hives or ''eczema'', and when they reach the airways, they can cause ''asthma''. As the allergens travel through the blood vessels, they can cause ''lightheadedness'', ''weakness'', and ''anaphylaxis'', which is a sudden drop in ''blood pressure''. Anaphylactic reactions are severe even when they start off with mild symptoms, such as a tingling in the mouth and throat or discomfort in the abdomen. They can be fatal if not treated quickly.'  "
What is exercise-induced food allergy?,"'Exercise'' can induce an allergic reaction to food. The usual scenario is that of a person eating a specific food and then exercising. As he exercises and his body temperature increases, he begins to ''itch'', gets lightheaded, and soon develops the characteristic allergic reactions of hives, asthma, abdominal symptoms, and even anaphylaxis. This condition has been referred to as food-dependent ''exercise''-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) and is most common in ''teens'' and young adults. The cure, actually a preventive measure, for exercise-induced food allergy is simple -- not eating for at least two hours before exercising.' "
Do infants and children have problems with food allergy?,"""Most allergies to foods begin in the first or second year of life. While some of these reactions may resolve over time (such as allergies to cow's milk or eggs), other food allergies acquired in infancy (such as allergies to nuts or shellfish) typically persist throughout life. Allergies to milk or ""'soy'' formula (a milk substitute made from soybeans) sometimes occur in infants and young children. These early allergies sometimes do not involve the usual hives or asthma but rather can cause symptoms in ''babies'' resembling infantile ''colic'', and perhaps ''blood in the stool'', or poor growth.''The clinical picture of infantile ''colic'', which usually starts within one month of birth, is that of a crying child who sleeps poorly at night. The cause of colic is uncertain. A variety of psychosocial and dietary factors have been implicated, however, and ''allergy to milk'' or soy has been proposed as a cause of colic in a minority of infants with colic.'""In infants, food allergy is usually diagnosed by observing the effect of changing the infant's diet; rarely, by using a food challenge. If the baby is on cow's milk, the doctor will suggest a change to soy formula or breast-feeding only, if possible. If the soy causes an allergic reaction, the baby can be placed on an elemental formula. These formulas are processed proteins and carbohydrates, basically amino acids and sugars, and contain few, if any, allergens.""'Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)'' is a bowel condition that affects children and is sometimes referred to as a delayed food allergy. It often occurs in infants who are beginning to eat solid foods. Unlike a typical food allergy, the symptoms come on hours after a food is consumed. It is a serious illness accompanied by vomiting and ''diarrhea''. In severe cases, ''dehydration'' and ''shock'' can result due to the fluid lost from diarrhea and vomiting. Milk, soy, and grains are the foods that most often trigger FPIES. Research has suggested that FPIES results from a different mechanism than the production of IgE antibodies seen with typical allergic reactions.''Breastfeeding'': Exclusive breastfeeding, that is, excluding all other foods, for at least the first four months of life appears to help protect high-risk children against ''milk allergy'' and ''eczema'' in the first two years of life. ''Breast milk'"" contains less protein that is foreign to the infant and, therefore, is less allergenic than cow's milk or soy formula. Exclusive breastfeeding should be a consideration, therefore, especially in infants who are predisposed to food allergy. Some children are so sensitive to a certain food, however, that if the mother eats that food, sufficient quantities enter the breast milk to cause a reaction to the food in the child. In this situation, the mothers themselves must avoid eating those foods to which the baby is allergic. No conclusive evidence has been obtained that suggests that breastfeeding prevents the development of allergies later in life.""'Special considerations in children'': An allergic child who itches, sneezes, and wheezes a lot can feel miserable and, therefore, sometimes misbehave or appear hyperactive. At the other extreme, children who are on allergy medicines that can cause drowsiness may become sleepy in school or at home. Parents and caregivers must understand these different behaviors, protect the children from the foods that induce their allergies, and know how to manage an allergic reaction, including how to administer epinephrine. Also, schools need to have plans in place to address emergencies, including ''anaphylactic shock''.' "
What are the most common food allergies?,"'According to the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology, eight foods are responsible for most food allergies:''In adults, the most common foods that cause allergic reactions are shellfish, such as shrimp, crayfish, lobster, and crab; nuts from trees, such as walnuts; fish; eggs; and peanuts, a legume that is one of the chief foods that cause serious anaphylactic reactions. In highly allergic people, even minuscule amounts of a food allergen (for example, 1/44,000 of a peanut kernel) can evoke an allergic reaction. Less sensitive people, however, may be able to tolerate small amounts of a food to which they are allergic.'""In children, the pattern is somewhat different from adults, and the most common foods that cause allergic reactions are eggs, milk, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, soy, fish, and fruits, particularly tomatoes and strawberries. Children sometimes outgrow their allergies, but adults usually do not lose theirs. Also, children are more likely to outgrow allergies to cow's milk or soy formula than allergies to peanuts, fish, or shrimp. Adults and children tend to react to those foods they eat more often. For example, in Japan, allergy to rice, and in Scandinavia, allergy to codfish, is more common than elsewhere.""   Cow's milk Eggs Fish Peanuts Shellfish Soy Tree nuts Wheat"
What is cross-reactivity?,"'Cross-reactivity is the occurrence of allergic reactions to foods or other substances that are chemically or otherwise related to foods known to cause allergy in an individual. If someone has a life-threatening reaction to a certain food, the doctor will counsel that patient to avoid related foods due to possible cross-reactivity, which also might induce the same reaction. For example, if a person has a history of a severe allergy to shrimp, he or she can also possibly be allergic to crab, lobster, and crayfish.' "
What is oral allergy syndrome?,"'The oral allergy syndrome is another type of cross-reactivity. This syndrome occurs in people who are highly sensitive, for example, to ragweed or birch pollen. During the seasons that these allergens pollinate, the affected individual may find that when he or she tries to eat fruits, chiefly melons and apples, a rapid onset of itching is experienced in the mouth and throat, and the fruit cannot be eaten. The oral allergy syndrome is also known as pollen-food allergy syndrome and is thought to be a type of ''contact allergy'' related to the presence of proteins in certain foods that cross react with allergy-causing pollen proteins. Oral allergy syndrome occurs in up to 50% of those who have ''allergic rhinitis'' caused by pollen. Symptoms are immediate upon ingestion of fresh or uncooked foods and include the itching, irritation, and mild swelling of the lips, tongue, palate, and throat. Cooked fruits and vegetables usually do not cause the reaction. The symptoms usually go away within minutes, although up to 10% of people will develop systemic (body-wide) symptoms, and a small number (1%-2%) may experience anaphylactic shock. Tree nuts and peanuts tend to cause more severe reactions than other foods.' "
What conditions have mistakenly been attributed to food allergy?,"'Research studies have shown that individuals who are prone to ''migraines'' can have their ''headaches'' brought on by histamine, which is one of the compounds that mast cells produce in an allergic reaction. The theory that food allergies can cause ''migraine'' ''headaches'', however, is unproven. There is also inadequate scientific research evidence to support the claims that food allergies can cause or aggravate ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''osteoarthritis'', tension-''fatigue'' syndrome, cerebral allergy (''headaches'' and ''difficulty concentrating''), environmental-toxic reactions, or ''hyperactivity'' in children.' "
What types of health care specialists diagnose and treat food allergies?,"'Allergists (including pediatric allergists) are medical doctors who have had special education and training in the diagnosis and treatment of allergies, including food allergies.' "
What is histamine toxicity? Is it a type of food allergy?,"'There are many conditions that can mimic food allergy. It is critical to distinguish true food allergy from other abnormal responses to food, that is, from food intolerance, which can occur in a variety of other illnesses or ''food poisoning'', which occurs when contaminated food is ingested. If a patient says to the doctor, ""I think I have a food allergy,"" the doctor has to consider a number of diagnoses. The possibilities include not only food allergy but also any other diseases that have symptoms brought on by food. These include reactions to certain chemicals in food for example, histamine or food additives, food poisoning, several other gastrointestinal diseases, and psychological symptoms.' Histamine toxicity: Some natural substances (for example, histamine) in foods can cause reactions resembling allergy. Histamine can reach high levels in cheese, some wines, and certain fish, particularly tuna and mackerel. In fish, the histamine is believed to stem from bacterial contamination, especially in fish that has not been refrigerated properly. Remember that mast cells release histamine in an allergic reaction. If a person eats a food that contains a high level of histamine, therefore, he may develop histamine toxicity, a response that strongly resembles an allergic reaction to food. Histamine toxicity has been referred to as pseudoallergic fish poisoning and accounts for over one-third of seafood-related food-borne illnesses, according to research from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."
Are food poisoning and food allergies the same condition? Is lactose deficiency a food allergy?," Food poisoning: Eating food that is contaminated with microorganisms, such as bacteria, and their products, such as toxins, is the usual cause of food poisoning. Thus, the ingestion of contaminated eggs, salad, milk, or meat can produce symptoms that mimic food allergy. Common microbes that can cause food poisoning include the noroviruses, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio vulnificus, and E. coli 0157:H7. Lactase deficiency (lactose intolerance): Another cause of food intolerance, which often is confused with a food allergy, specifically to milk, is lactase deficiency. This common food intolerance affects at least one out of 10 people. Lactase is an enzyme in the lining of the small intestine. This enzyme digests or breaks down lactose, a complex sugar in milk, to simple sugars, which are then absorbed into the blood. If a person has lactase deficiency, he does not have enough lactase to digest the lactose in most milk products. Instead, other bacteria in the intestine use the undigested lactose, thereby producing gas. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In a diagnostic test for lactase deficiency, the patient ingests a specific amount of lactose. Then, by analyzing a blood sample for simple sugars, the doctor determines the patient's ability to digest the lactose and absorb the simple sugars. A lower than normal value usually means a lactase deficiency."
"Are gluten-sensitive enteropathy, other gastrointestinal diseases, or phychological factors related to food allergies?"," Gluten-sensitive enteropathy: Intolerance to gluten occurs in a disease called gluten-sensitive enteropathy, or celiac sprue (also called celiac disease). A unique abnormal immune response to certain components of gluten, which is a constituent of the cereal grains wheat, rye, and barley, causes celiac disease. Although sometimes referred to as an allergy to gluten, research has revealed that this immune response involves a branch of the immune system that is different from the one involved in a classical food allergy. It involves a misdirected immune system, referred to as autoimmunity. The patients have an abnormality in the lining of the small intestine and experience diarrhea and malabsorption, especially of dietary fat. The treatment for this condition involves consuming a gluten-free diet. Other gastrointestinal diseases: Several other gastrointestinal diseases produce abdominal symptoms (especially nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain) that are sometimes caused by food. These diseases, therefore, can resemble food allergies. Examples include peptic ulcer, gallstones, non-ulcer dyspepsia (which is a type of indigestion), Crohn's disease (regional enteritis), cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, and a rare condition called eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Psychological: Some people have a food intolerance that has a psychological origin. In these people, a careful psychiatric evaluation may identify a traumatic event in that person's life, often during childhood, tied to eating a particular food. The eating of that food years later, even as an adult, is associated with a rush of symptoms that can resemble an allergic reaction to food."
How do health care professionals diagnose food allergies? What tests do health specialists use to diagnose food allergies?,"""To diagnose food allergy, a health care professional first must determine if the patient is having an adverse reaction to specific foods. A history of foods consumed and resulting symptoms is key information for the physician in the early stages of diagnosis. The doctor makes an assessment with the help of a detailed history from the patient, the patient's dietary diary, or an elimination diet. He or she then confirms the diagnosis by the more objective skin tests, blood tests, or food challenges.""'History'': The health history usually is the most important diagnostic tool in diagnosing food allergy. The physician interviews the patient to determine if the facts are consistent with a food allergy. The health care professional may ask the following questions:'   What was the timing of the reaction? Did the reaction come on quickly, usually within an hour after eating the food? Was treatment for allergy successful? For example, if hives stem from a food allergy, antihistamines should relieve them. Is the reaction always associated with a certain food? Did anyone else get sick? For example, if the person has eaten fish contaminated with histamine, everyone who ate the fish should be sick. In an allergic reaction, however, only the person allergic to the fish becomes ill. How much did the patient eat before experiencing a reaction? The severity of the patient's reaction can sometimes relate to the amount of the suspect food eaten. How was the food prepared? Some people will have a violent allergic reaction only to raw or undercooked fish. A thorough cooking of the fish destroys those allergens in the fish to which they react, so that they then can eat it with no allergic reaction. Were other foods eaten at the same time as the food that caused the allergic reaction? Fatty foods can delay digestion and thus delay the onset of the allergic reaction."
What skin and blood tests diagnose the causes of food allergies?," Skin tests: In a percutaneous skin prick-puncture skin test, a dilute extract of the suspected food is placed on the skin of the forearm or back. This portion of the skin then is punctured or pricked with a needle and observed for swelling or redness, which would signify a local allergic reaction to the food. A positive prick-puncture test indicates that the patient has the IgE antibody that is specific for the food being tested on the skin's mast cells. Skin tests are rapid, simple, and relatively safe.A person can have a positive skin test to a food allergen, however, without experiencing allergic reactions to that food. A doctor diagnoses a food allergy only when the patient has a positive skin test to a specific allergen and the history suggests an allergic reaction to the same food. In some highly allergic people, however, especially if they have had anaphylactic reactions, skin tests should not be done because they could provoke another dangerous reaction. Skin tests also cannot be done in patients with extensive eczema. A person can have a positive skin test to a food allergen, however, without experiencing allergic reactions to that food. A doctor diagnoses a food allergy only when the patient has a positive skin test to a specific allergen and the history suggests an allergic reaction to the same food. In some highly allergic people, however, especially if they have had anaphylactic reactions, skin tests should not be done because they could provoke another dangerous reaction. Skin tests also cannot be done in patients with extensive eczema. Blood tests: In those situations where skin tests cannot be done, a doctor may use blood tests such as the RAST, ImmunoCap, and the ELISA. These tests measure the presence of food-specific IgE antibodies in the blood of patients, but they cost more than skin tests, and the results are not available immediately. As with positive skin tests, positive blood tests make the diagnosis of a specific food allergy only when the clinical history is compatible."
What types of diets help diagnose the cause of food allergies?,"""If the patient's history, dietary diary, or elimination diet suggests that a specific food allergy is likely, the doctor then will use tests, such as skin tests, blood tests, and a food challenge, which can more objectively confirm an allergic response to food."" Dietary diary: Sometimes, a history alone cannot determine the diagnosis. In that situation, the doctor may ask the patient to keep a record of the contents of each meal and whether reactions occurred that are consistent with allergy. The dietary diary provides more details than the oral history, so that the doctor and patient can better determine if there is a consistent relationship between a food and the allergic reactions. Elimination diet: The next step that some doctors use is an elimination diet. Under the doctor's direction, the patient does not eat a food suspected of causing the allergy (for example, eggs) and substitutes another food (in this instance, another source of protein). If after the patient removes the food, the symptoms go away, the doctor almost always can make a diagnosis of food allergy. If the patient then resumes eating the food (still under the doctor's direction) and the symptoms return, this sequence confirms the diagnosis. The patient should not resume eating the food, however, if the allergic reactions have been severe because this re-challenge is too risky. This technique is also not suitable if the allergic reactions have been infrequent."
What are food allergy treatments?,"'Dietary avoidance'': Avoiding the offending allergen in the diet is the primary focus of food allergy treatment. Once a food to which the patient is sensitive has been identified, the food must be removed from the diet. To do this, affected people need to read lengthy, detailed lists of ingredients on the label for each food they consider eating. Many allergy-producing foods such as peanuts, eggs, and milk appear in foods that are not ordinarily associated with them. For example, peanuts often are used as protein ''supplements'', eggs are found in some salad dressings, and milk is in bakery products. The FDA requires that the ingredients in a food be listed on its label, and careful attention to food labels is critical for anyone with food allergies. People can avoid most of the foods to which they are sensitive if they carefully read the labels on foods and, when in ''restaurants'', avoid ordering foods that might contain ingredients to which they are allergic.''Treating an anaphylactic reaction'': People with severe food allergies must be prepared to treat an anaphylactic reaction. Education about the signs of a reaction and how to manage the reaction is essential. Even those who know a lot about their own allergies can either make an error or be served food that does not comply with their instructions, including food that may have had cross-contact with allergy-causing foods during cooking or preparation. To protect themselves, people who have had anaphylactic reactions to a food should wear medical alert bracelets or necklaces stating that they have a food allergy and that they are subject to severe reactions. These individuals also always should carry a syringe of adrenaline (epinephrine [''EpiPen'', ''Auvi-Q'']), obtained by prescription from their doctors; people with severe food allergies should be prepared to self-administer epinephrine if they think they are developing an allergic reaction. They then should immediately seek medical help by either calling the rescue squad or having themselves transported to an emergency room.''Treating other symptoms of food allergy'': Several medications are available for treating the other symptoms of food allergy. For example, antihistamines can relieve gastrointestinal symptoms, hives, ''sneezing'', and a ''runny nose''. ''Bronchodilators'' can relieve the ''symptoms of asthma''. These medications are taken after a person inadvertently has ingested a food to which he is allergic. They are not effective, however, in preventing an allergic reaction when taken prior to eating the food. In fact, no medication in any form is available to reliably prevent an allergic reaction to a certain food before eating that food.'  "
Are allergy shots effective in preventing or decreasing food allergy?,"'Allergy shots'', a form of treatment known as immunotherapy, involve injecting small quantities of substances to which the patient is allergic. The shots are given regularly for a long time with the aim of desensitizing the patient or getting the patient to tolerate the allergen without developing symptoms. This type of therapy is effective in controlling symptoms of allergies related to hay ''fever'', ''indoor allergens'', and ''insect stings''. Researchers, however, have not yet proven that these shots can prevent any allergic reactions to food.'  "
What are complications of food allergies?,"'The most serious complication, as mentioned earlier, is the development of a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction.' "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for food allergy?,"'As described above, avoidance of the trigger food is the primary treatment for food allergy. The outlook is excellent for those who are able to avoid consuming the allergen and who remain prepared to treat a ''severe allergic reaction'' such as anaphylaxis. There are no long-term complications associated with food allergy, other than the risk for severe reactions.' "
What research is being done on food allergies?,"'Research is ongoing in many areas of food allergy. Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) is an organization that awards research grants to investigators who are studying questions such as who gets food allergies and the possible role of factors including diet, hygiene, geography, ethnicity, and others in causing food allergy. FARE also has resources and education for families and patients suffering from food allergy.''Food allergy is caused by immune reactions to foods, sometimes in individuals or families predisposed to allergies. A number of foods, especially shellfish, milk, eggs, peanuts, and fruit can cause allergic reactions (notably hives, asthma, abdominal symptoms, lightheadedness, and anaphylaxis) in adults or children. When a food allergy is suspected, a medical evaluation is the key to proper management.''It is important to distinguish a true food allergy from other abnormal responses to food, that is, food intolerances, which actually are far more common than food allergy. Once the diagnosis of food allergy is made (primarily by the medical history) and the allergen is identified (usually by skin tests), the treatment basically is to avoid the offending food. People with food allergies should work with their physicians and become knowledgeable about allergies and how they are diagnosed and treated.' "
What is the oral food challenge used to diagnose food allergies?," Oral food challenge: The double-blind food challenge has become the gold standard for objective allergy testing. (Some physicians prefer the term double-masked, rather than double-blind.) In this test, various foods, some of which are suspected of inducing an allergic reaction, are placed in individual opaque capsules. Both the patient and the doctor are blinded, so that neither of them knows which capsules contain the suspected allergens. (The capsules are prepared by another medical worker.) The patient swallows a capsule and the doctor then observes whether an allergic reaction occurs. This process is repeated with each capsule. Alternatively, the food to be tested may be disguised in another type of food to which the person is not allergic.The advantage of a food challenge is that if the patient has an allergic reaction only to the suspected foods and not to the other foods tested, the diagnosis of food allergy is confirmed. Just as with a re-challenge after the elimination diet and with the skin tests, however, someone having a history of severe reactions should not be tested with a food challenge because of the danger of inducing another severe reaction. In addition, this procedure is expensive because it is difficult and requires a lot of time, especially for patients with multiple food allergies. This type of test must also be done under the careful supervision of a physician. Consequently, double-blind food challenges are done infrequently. They are done most commonly, however, when the doctor wishes to obtain evidence to confirm the suspicion that the patient's symptoms are not due to a food allergy. Then, additional efforts may be directed at finding the real cause of the patient's symptoms.

What is food poisoning?,"'Food poisoning is a food borne disease. Ingestion of food that contains a toxin, chemical or infectious agent (like a bacterium, virus, parasite, or prion) may cause adverse symptoms in the body. Those symptoms may be related only to the gastrointestinal tract causing ''vomiting'' or ''diarrhea'' or they may involve other organs such as the kidney, brain, or muscle.''Typically most foodborne diseases cause vomiting and ''diarrhea'' that tend to be short lived and resolve on their own, but ''dehydration'' and ''electrolyte'' abnormalities may develop. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates approximately 48 million people become ill from food-related diseases each year resulting in 128,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000 deaths.''According to the CDC, in 2018, the most common forborne illnesses in the United States each year are caused by:\xa0'   Norovirus. Campylobacter. Clostridium perfringens. Staphylococcus aureus. Salmonella."
How do you know if you have food poisoning or the stomach flu?,"'Food poisoning and the ''stomach flu'' may or may not be the same thing, depending if the causative agent is transmitted by contaminated food, or if the agent is transmitted by non-food mechanisms such as body secretions. Most health-care professionals equate stomach ''flu'' to viral ''gastroenteritis''.''Stomach flu is a non-specific term that describes an illness that usually resolves within 24 hours and is caused commonly by the ''adenovirus'', Norwalk virus or ''rotavirus'', (rotavirus is most commonly found in children).''If numerous cases of viral gastroenteritis occur in a situation where many people have been eating, it certainly may be considered food poisoning. Norwalk virus is responsible for many cases of food borne illness outbreaks on cruise ships.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of food poisoning?,"'Food poisoning most commonly causes:''This can cause significant amounts of fluid loss and diarrhea along with ''nausea'' and vomiting may make it difficult to replace lost fluid, leading to ''dehydration''. In developing countries where infectious epidemics cause diarrheal illnesses, thousands of people die because of dehydration.''As noted in the section above, other organ systems may be infected and affected by food poisoning. Symptoms will depend upon what organ system is involved (for example, ''encephalopathy'' due to brain infection).'   stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea."
What are the symptoms and incubation time for large and small intestinal food poisoning?,"'Large intestine'' and small intestine have an intermediate incubation from about 1 to 3 days.''Infections of the large intestine or colon can cause bloody, mucousy diarrhea associated with crampy ''abdominal pain''.''Diarrhea due to small bowel infection tends not to be bloody, but infections may affect both the small and large intestine at the same time.' Campylobacter, according to CDC data, is the number one cause of food-borne disease in the United States. Shigella spp contaminate food and water and cause dysentery (severe diarrhea often containing mucus and blood). Salmonella infections often occur because of poorly or undercooked cooked and/or poor handling of the chicken and eggs. In individuals with weakened immune systems, including the elderly, the infection can enter the bloodstream and cause potentially life-threatening infections. Vibrio parahaemolyticus can contaminate saltwater shellfish and cause a watery diarrhea. E. coli (enterotoxigenic) is the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea. It lacks symptoms such as fever or bloody diarrhea. Vibrio cholerae, often from contaminated drinking, water produces a voluminous watery diarrhea resembling rice-water. Viruses such as Norwalk, rotavirus and adenovirus tend to have other symptoms associated with an infection including fever, chills, headache, and vomiting. Botulism is caused by Clostridium botulinum toxin and may present with fever, vomiting, mild diarrhea, numbness, and weakness leading to paralysis."
What are the symptoms and incubation period for E. coli 0157:H7 and Yersinia enterocolitica infections?,"'Hemorrhagic ''E. coli'' ''0157:H7'' and ''Yersinia enterocolitica'' infection have a long incubation period of 3 to 5 days.''Some ""food poisonings"" may not be due to toxins or chemicals in food but to infectious agents that happen to contaminate the food. E. coli O157:H7 (hemorrhagic E. coli) usually occurs when contaminated food is eaten, but it also can spread from' Hemorrhagic E. coli (mainly E. coli 0157:H7) can cause inflammation of the colon leading to bloody stools. In some children, about a week after infection, it can progress to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Elderly individuals may contract thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Toxins from the bacteria enter the blood stream and hemolyze or destroy red blood cells. In addition, the toxins cause kidney failure and uremia, where waste products build up in the body. Yersinia enterocolitica may cause inflammation of lymph nodes in the lining of the abdomen and may mimic appendicitis. contaminated drinking water, a contaminated swimming pool, or passed from child to child in a daycare center."
What are the symptoms and incubation period for chemical and bacterial causes of food poisoning?,"'Chemical and ''bacterial infections'' have a short incubation of less than 16 to 24 hours' Scrombroid poisoning usually is due to poorly cooked or stored fish. The affected person will experience flushing, shortness of breath, and difficulty swallowing within 1 to 2 hours of eating. Ciguatera poisoning is another fish toxin that occurs after eating fish such as grouper, snapper, and barracuda. Symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea, muscle aches, and neurologic complaints including headache, numbness and tingling, hallucinations, and difficulty with balance (ataxia). Mushroom ingestion can cause initial symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea. Eating Amanita mushrooms can cause liver and kidney failure leading to death. Staphylococcus aureus poisoning is due to a toxin that is pre-formed in food before it is eaten. It causes vomiting within 1 to 6 hours after eating the contaminated food. Bacillus cereus is an infection that occurs after eating poorly cooked or raw rice. Clostridium perfringens produces a spore that may germinate in cooked meat that has been stored in an environment that was too warm. Within 8 to 12 hours, it may cause profuse diarrhea."
"What are the symptoms and incubation time for viruses, parasites, bacteria, and other pathogenic infections?ctions?","'Parasites''Bacteria''Virus''Protozoans''Prion' Giardiasis may occur after drinking water from lakes or rivers that have been contaminated by beavers, muskrats, or sheep that have been grazing. It also can be passed from person to person, for example in day care settings. Amoebiasis is encountered in contaminated drinking water, usually in tropical or semitropical climates and can be passed person to person. Trichinosis is due to an infection from eating undercooked pork or wild game such as bear meat. Aside from fever and gastrointestinal complaints, symptoms include muscle pain, facial swelling, and bleeding around the eyes and under the fingernails. Cysticercosis is often seen in developing countries where water is contaminated with pork tapeworms and the person swallows the ova form the tapeworm. The infection can invade the brain (neurocysticercosis) causing seizures. Cyclospora is a one-celled parasite that infects the small intestine causing explosive, watery bowel movements. Cyclospora infection is contracted by eating contaminated food or drinking water. Cyclospora infection usually does not spread from person to person. Symptoms may also include headache, body aches, and malaise and can mimic a viral type infection. Without antibiotic treatment, Cyclospora infection will gradually resolve over the course of many weeks, but may come and go (relapse) over that period. Listeriosis usually occurs after foods contaminated with Listeria bacteria are ingested. These include unpasteurized, raw milk, soft cheeses, and processed meats and poultry. Vegetables and fruits may also become infected with  Listeria. The bacteria may lay dormant in or on the surface of the food products for weeks. Brucellosis occurs by ingesting raw or unpasteurized milk and cheese, especially goat's milk contaminated with Brucella spp Hepatitis A is spread by poor food handling, and not due to blood exposure such as in hepatitis B and C. Toxoplasmosis is usually transmitted to humans from cat feces containing Toxoplasma parasites; most infections are asymptomatic, but people who have diminished immune systems can develop systemic disease symptoms. Bovine Spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) is acquired by eating foods containing prions (transmissible agents that induce abnormal folding of brain protein) contaminating brain or spinal cord from infected cows."
What are the symptoms of food poisoning from undercooked and stored foods?,"'Other illnesses may involve chemical toxins that are produced in certain foods that are poorly cooked or stored.

Who is at a higher risk of getting food poisoning?,"'Newborns, the elderly, and others with compromised immune systems are at higher risk of becoming ill with ''Listeria'' infections. ''Pregnant'' women are also at higher risk of contracting ''Listeria'' infections, and to avoid infections and to prevent giving the infection to the fetus.''Pregnant women are recommended to avoid these foods to reduce the risk of contracting a ''Listeria ''infections.' soft cheeses like brie, camembert, and blue (cream cheese is safe).???????"
How long does food poisoning last?," Most cases of food poisoning last about 1 to 2 days and symptoms resolve on their own. If symptoms persist longer than that, the person should contact their health-care professional. Cyclospora infections may be difficult to detect and diarrhea may last for weeks. Health-care professionals may consider this parasite as the potential cause of food poisoning in patients with prolonged symptoms."
What are the most common infectious types and causes of food poisoning?,"'the most common causes\xa0food poisoning may be due to infections caused by''More than 200 infectious causes exist.

What causes food poisoning?,'There many causes of food poisoning. Sometimes they are classified by how quickly the symptoms begin after eating potentially contaminated food. Think of this as the incubation time from when food enters the body until symptoms begin.\xa0'  
What tests diagnose food poisoning?,"'Most times, the diagnosis of food poisoning is made by history and physical examination. Often, the patient volunteers the diagnosis when they come for medical care. For example, ""I got sick after eating potato salad at a picnic,"" or, ""I drank a raw egg protein shake.""''The health-care professional may ask questions about the symptoms, when they started, and how long they have lasted. A review of systems may help give direction as to what type of infection is present. For example, a patient with numbness of their ''feet'' and weakness may be asked about whether they have opened any home canned food recently.''Travel history may be helpful to see if the patient had been camping near a stream or lake and the potential for drinking contaminated water, or if they have traveled out of the country recently and have eaten different foods than they normally do, such as raw eggs or wild game.''Physical examination begins with taking the vital signs of the patient (''blood pressure'', pulse rate, and temperature). Clinical signs of dehydration include dry, tenting skin, sunken eyes, ''dry mouth'', and lack of sweat in the armpits and groin. In infants, in addition to the above, subtle signs of dehydration may include poor muscle tone, poor suckling, and sunken fontanelle.''Routine blood tests are not usually ordered unless there is concern about something more than the vomiting and diarrhea. In patients with significant dehydration, the health-care professional may want to check electrolyte levels in the blood as well as kidney function. If there is concern about ''hemolytic uremic syndrome'', a ''complete blood count'' (hemogram, ''CBC'') to check the red blood cells, white blood cells, and ''platelet count'' may be ordered. If there is concern about ''hepatitis'', ''liver function'' tests may be ordered.''Stool'' samples may be useful especially if there is concern about infections caused by ''Salmonella, ''Shigella'', and ''Campylobacter'', the common non '""traveler's diarrhea""'. This is especially true when the patient presents with bloody diarrhea, thought to be due to infection. If there is concern about a parasite infection, stool samples can be examined also for the presence of parasites. Some parasites may be very difficult to see under the microscope, including ''Cyclospora'', because it is so tiny.''Depending on the suspected cause of the food poisoning, there are some immunological tests (for example, detection of Shiga toxins) that the CDC recommends. ''Cyclospora'' DNA may be detected in the stool using molecular testing called ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR''). Other methods may be used (for example, detection of prions in tissue samples).' "
What is the treatment for food poisoning?,"   Maintaining good hydration is the first priority when treating food poisoning. Hospitalization may be appropriate if the patient is dehydrated or if they have other underlying medical conditions that become unstable because of the fluid or electrolyte imbalance in their body. Medications may be prescribed to help control nausea and vomiting. Medications to decrease the frequency of diarrhea may be indicated, but if food poisoning is suspected, it is best to consult a health-care professional before taking OTC (over-the-counter) medications such as loperamide (Imodium), because it may cause increased problems for the patient. Except for specific infections, antibiotics are not prescribed in the treatment of most food poisoning. Often, the health-care professional will decide upon their use based on multiple factors such as the intensity of the disease symptoms, the additional health factors of the patient, a serious response to infection (sepsis), and organ system compromise. For example, a pregnant woman suspected of having listeriosis will likely be treated with IV antibiotics because of the effect of the infection on the fetus. Complications of certain types of food poisoning are best treated in consultation with infectious disease specialists (for example, HUS, TTP, bovine spongiform encephalopathy)."
What natural and home remedies treat food poisoning?,"'The key to home care is being able to keep the person hydrated. Drinking a lot of water or a balanced electrolyte solution such as Gatorade or ''Pedialyte'' usually is adequate to replenish the body with fluids. A person can lose a significant amount of fluid with an episode of diarrhea and/or vomiting, and these fluids need to be replaced. People who show any signs of dehydration such as decreased urination, ''dizziness'', or dry mucous membranes, especially in the young or elderly, should see a health-care professional.'  "
What are the complications of food poisoning?,"'The first and most important complication of food poisoning is dehydration. Food poisoning can cause significant loss of body water and changes in the electrolyte levels in the blood.''If the affected individual has underlying medical conditions requiring medication, persistent vomiting may make it difficult to swallow and digest those medications.''Other complications of food poisoning are specific to the type of infection. Some are listed in the causes of food poisoning such as HUS, TTP, or encephalopathy.' "
Can you die from food poisoning?,"'Listeria'' is a type of bacteria that has caused the ''two most deadly outbreaks'' of food poisoning in United States history. In 1985, an outbreak in California was traced to eating a type of fresh cheese, and in 2011, ''Listeria'' food poisoning was traced to a cantaloupe farm and processing operation in Colorado.''Listeria ''most often is associated with' eating soft cheeses, raw milk, contaminated fruits, contaminated vegetables, contaminated poultry, and contaminated meats."
When should you call the doctor for food poisoning?,"'With a clear fluid ''diet'' and rest, most infections resolve on their own within 24 hours. A health-care professional should be contacted if the vomiting and diarrhea are associated with one or more of the following symptoms:' fever, blood in the stools, signs of dehydration including lightheadedness when standing, weakness, decreased urination, diarrhea that lasts longer than 72 hours, and/or repeated vomiting that prevents drinking and rehydrating (replacing the fluids lost due to fever, diarrhea, and vomiting)."
What is the prognosis food poisoning?,"'Fortunately, most cases of food poisoning are self-limiting and resolve within a few hours to a few days and the affected individual returns to normal function.'""Depending upon the cause of the infection, and the patient's underlying medical condition, the infection may cause significant organ damage and even death.""

Tips to prevent food poisoning,"'Prevention of food borne illness begins at home with proper food preparation technique.' Foods should be cooked thoroughly. This especially applies to raw meat, eggs, and poultry. A meat thermometer can be used to measure the internal temperature of a meat dish. Leftovers should be refrigerated immediately so bacteria and viruses do not have time to start growing. Wash fruits and vegetables well before eating. This removes dirt, pesticides, chemicals, or other infectious agents used on, or exposed to, the foods in the fields or storage facilities. Wash hands routinely before and after handling food to help prevent the spread of infection. Thoroughly clean counters and other areas that are used to clean, prepare, and assemble foods. Cross contamination of food is common and can cause food poisonings. For example, a cutting board and knife used to cut raw chicken should be washed thoroughly before cutting up fruit and vegetables to prevent the spread of Salmonella. In restaurants, meals are prepared by others. Health inspectors check restaurants routinely and their reports on sanitary practices are usually available online. Make certain the food ordered is thoroughly cooked, especially meats such hamburger. Pregnant women and people who have compromised immune systems, such as those undergoing chemotherapy or who are taking medication such as prednisone, should avoid eating soft cheeses like camembert, brie, blue, and feta because of the risk of contracting Listeria. Be very sure all fruits and vegetables are cleaned thoroughly prior to eating, no matter the source."
What are the signs and symptoms of a broken foot?,"'Broken bones are painful, especially when they are weight bearing. Common signs and symptoms of a ''broken bone'' in the foot include:''Other signs and symptoms of a broken foot include:'   Pain Limping Swelling Bruising Tenderness Walking may be too painful Joint dislocation: If the bones are significantly displaced (the bone alignment has been lost or there is an associated joint dislocation) a deformity of the foot may be apparent. People with existing diseases or conditions: with altered pain sensation due to peripheral neuropathy (persons with diabetes are a classic example), pain may not be present, and the fracture may be missed initially. This also may occur in persons with spinal cord injuries. Bruising, swelling, and deformity may be the only clues to a potential fracture."
What are the signs and symptoms of a broken foot in an infant or toddler?, Infants and toddlers may ignore the pain of their injured foot when they see a health-care professional. They may refuse to bear weight on their leg. The child may sit comfortably on the parent's lap without complaint until asked or made to stand.
How many bones are in the foot (pictures)?,"'The foot is designed to withstand the considerable forces placed on it by walking, ''running'', and jumping. There are 26 bones of the foot, connected by joints and supported by thickened ligaments to absorb the impact of movement. As well, the joints of the foot are acted upon by muscles and tendons that allow flexing and extending to permit walking and running to occur.''The bony anatomy can be described as:' The hindfoot consists of the talus that forms the base of the ankle joint where it meets the tibia (shin bone) and the calcaneous or heel bone. Ligaments from both the talus and the heel bone span the ankle joint and attach to the tibia and fibula (the other shin bone) to provide stability. The midfoot consists of the navicular, the cuboid, and the three cuneiform bones. The midfoot is where inversion and supination of the foot occurs. These motions allow the sole of the foot to turn inwards and upwards. In the forefoot, the five metatarsal bones are connected to each toe. The toe bones are called phalanges (single = phalanx) with the big toe having two and the other four toes having three each. These bones are named based upon their relationship to the body: proximal, middle and distal. Proximal means closest to the center of the body while distal is furthest from the center. The toenails are located over the digital phalanges. The arch of the foot is maintained by the plantar fascia, a thick fibrous band of tissue that runs from the calcaneus to the metatarsal bones, preventing the bones of the foot from flattening. There are places in the foot where two bones meet to form a joint. Each joint has its own set of structures that help maintain stability. Injuries to the foot include fractures of the bone, sprains of the ligaments that stabilize the joints, and strains of the muscles and tendons that move the foot. Joints can also become inflamed (arthritis). Arthritis can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term)."
What are the causes of a broken foot?,"'A fracture, break, and ''crack'' all mean the same thing when it comes to a bone injury: the integrity of the bone has been damaged. The cause of injury may be obvious, such as jumping from a height or a heavy object falling and landing on the foot, or it may develop gradually over time, such as the result of the constant ''stress'' of walking or running.'   Foot fractures account for 10% of all the broken bones in the body, and the mechanism of injury usually can give a clue as to what bone might be injured. Fractures of the calcaneus (heel bone) usually occur when a person jumps or falls from a height, landing directly on their feet. The force of the landing may also be transmitted up the body to cause fractures of the ankle, knee, hip, and lumbar spine. Injuries to the midfoot, the metatarsals, and phalanges often are caused by a direct blow sustained when a kick goes awry or from a crush injury when a heavy object is dropped on the foot. Twisting injuries can cause bones to break. For example, fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal occur when the ankle rolls inward and a fragment of the bone is pulled off (avulsed) by the peroneus tendon. The most common causes of an injured foot include falls; crush injuries (including impacts from a heavy object or an automobile accident) missed steps, and stress/overuse injuries."
What is the healing time for a broken foot?,'Recovery and healing time for a broken foot depends upon the type of fracture and the bones broken.' 
How can I tell if I have a broken bone in my foot?,"'A broken foot is diagnosed by the health-care practitioner taking a history of how the injury occurred. The mechanism of injury will give clues as to what type of injury may exist and importantly, what other associated injuries may also be potentially present. It is helpful to know how much time has passed from when the injury occurred to when the patient presents for care. Past medical history is important; those with ''diabetes'' or other conditions that suppress the immune system are at greater risk for infection with foot injuries.'   Inspection of the foot for swelling, bruising, deformities and open wounds. Palpation allows the health care professional to feel where the pain is located. This is very helpful if X-rays are taken, since it allows the health care professional to correlate areas of tenderness with the anatomy seen on the X-Ray. (This is particularly important in children whose bones may not have yet calcified. Fractures may be easily missed since they occur through cartilage instead of bone.) An exam of the circulatory system, feeling for pulses, and assessing how quickly blood returns to the tip of a toe after it is pressed and the toe turns white (capillary refill). A neurologic exam, assessing sensation such as light touch and pin prick sensations Motor function, asking the patient to move the injured area. This assists in assessing muscle and tendon function. The ability to move the foot means only that the muscles and tendons work, and does not guarantee bone integrity or stability. The concept that ""it can't be broken because I can move it"" is not correct. A range of motion exam of the foot may be helpful in assessing ligament stability. However, if the fracture is obvious, the health care practitioner may choose to keep the foot immobilized to prevent further pain. X-rays are often taken to evaluate the status of the bones in the foot and to check for fracture. Usually three views are taken to help the health care professional and radiologist adequately view the bones. Special views may be taken if there is concern for a fracture of the calcaneus. X-rays may not be taken for simple toe injuries, since the result may not affect the treatment plan. For some foot fractures, X-rays may not be adequate to visualize the injury. This is often true for metatarsal stress fractures, where bone scans may be used if the history and physical examination suggest a potential stress fracture, but the plain X-rays are normal. Computerized tomography (CT) may be used to assess fractures of the calcaneus and talus, since it may better be able to illustrate the anatomy of the ankle and midfoot joint and potential associated injuries. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used in some cases of foot fractures. The Lisfranc joint describes the connection between the first, second, and third metatarsals and the three cuneiform bones. A Lisfranc fracture dislocation often requires a CT scan to evaluate this region of the foot. While X-rays may hint at the damage in this type of injury, the CT can delineate the numerous bones and joints that may be damaged."
What can you do for a broken foot (treatment)?,"   First aid at home may include RICE (rest, ice, elevation, and compression). Rest may include the use of crutches to limit weight bearing as tolerated. If the decision is made to seek medical care, this regimen may be continued once the patient is discharged from the hospital to go home. The treatment of a foot fracture depends upon what bone is broken, the mechanism of injury, the underlying medical condition of the patient, and whether the fracture is open (the skin is broken) or closed (the skin is intact). Broken toes are often treated symptomatically, with the injured toe ""buddy taped"" to an adjacent normal toe. It may be helpful to place cotton balls or other absorbent material between the toes to prevent dampness and skin injury. A stiff-soled shoe and crutches may be needed to help with walking. Healing should occur within 4 to 6 weeks. Fractures of the great toe that are displaced may require surgery to allow better healing. An orthopedic surgeon or podiatrist (foot specialist) may choose this option, but often that decision is made electively a few days after the injury. Open fractures of the toe usually require good wound cleansing to prevent infection. At the same time the health care practitioner will often explore the wound, looking for foreign objects and evaluate the condition of deep structures like tendons, looking for lacerations. Metatarsal fractures often heal nicely with conservative care, meaning no operation is needed. The foot is wrapped for comfort to decrease swelling and placed in an orthopedic post-op or Reese shoe. Cast boots also may be considered.First metatarsal fractures that are aligned nicely may be treated with a post-op shoe with no weight bearing. If the fracture is displaced, meaning the bone fragments do not align, an operation to pin or plate the fracture may be considered.Second, third, and fourth metatarsal fractures tend to heal nicely with an ace wrap for support and weight bearing as tolerated.Stress fractures usually involve the second and third metatarsals, and are called ""March fractures."" March fractures were initially recognized in military recruits who were required to quickly increase the amount they walked. Splints , casts, or walking boots may be considered for pain control.Fifth metatarsal fractures are of two types. Avulsion fracture at the very base of the bone are treated in the same way as the other metatarsal fractures.Jones fractures of the fifth metatarsal shaft have a non-healing (non-union) rate of up to 50% and often require surgery to fix the fracture. First metatarsal fractures that are aligned nicely may be treated with a post-op shoe with no weight bearing. If the fracture is displaced, meaning the bone fragments do not align, an operation to pin or plate the fracture may be considered. Second, third, and fourth metatarsal fractures tend to heal nicely with an ace wrap for support and weight bearing as tolerated. Stress fractures usually involve the second and third metatarsals, and are called ""March fractures."" March fractures were initially recognized in military recruits who were required to quickly increase the amount they walked. Splints , casts, or walking boots may be considered for pain control. Fifth metatarsal fractures are of two types. Avulsion fracture at the very base of the bone are treated in the same way as the other metatarsal fractures. Jones fractures of the fifth metatarsal shaft have a non-healing (non-union) rate of up to 50% and often require surgery to fix the fracture. Lisfranc fracture dislocation injuries require surgery for repair. The treatment of talus fractures depends upon where in the bone the fracture occurs. The top of the talus is dome-shaped and is part of the ankle joint, fitting into the base of the tibia or shin bone. This fracture may not be easily identified and sometimes can be mistaken for a non-healing ankle sprain. The treatment is rest and avoidance of weight bearing. Talar neck fractures often have difficulty healing because of poor blood supply. Surgery may be required if the bone is displaced, otherwise no weight bearing in a cast for 2-3 months may be required. A Shepherd fracture involves the posterior, or back part, of the talus and is seen in athletes who dance or kick. The treatment is immobilization in a cast. Lateral process fractures of the talus are becoming more common with increasing numbers of snowboarding injuries. Treatment includes no weight bearing in a cast. Calcaneus fractures require significant force to occur and are associated with a marked amount of swelling and pain. An orthopedic surgeon or podiatrist is often consulted emergently to decide whether surgery is needed to stabilize the fracture. CT scan may be needed to assess the extent of the fracture, and whether the fracture line enters the joint. The health-care professional also may look for associated injuries of the ankle, knee, hip, and lumbar spine. Immobilization of the fractured foot will help with pain control. Anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can be helpful with over-the-counter pain control by decreasing inflammation in the area. Narcotic pain medication may also be prescribed if needed. Rest, ice, and elevation will help limit swelling and decrease pain."
What are the complications of a broken foot?,"'As with any injury, complications may occur.'   Broken bones may fail to heal, causing a non-union that may require surgery to repair. If the fracture line enters a joint surface, arthritis may develop, even if the joint surface has been aligned by surgery. Open fractures may be complicated by infection and damage to underlying structures like tendons, arteries, and nerves. Though it is uncommon, crush injuries to the foot may cause significant swelling in the tight spaces of the foot, leading to compartment syndrome. Should the pressure in one of these compartments rise above the patient's blood pressure, decreasing blood flow to the area of foot beyond the injury. This is a surgical emergency and fasciotomies, incisions into the foot compartments, are performed to allow space for the swelling to occur, relieve the pressure, and restore blood supply to the foot."
Is it possible to prevent a broken foot?," The foot is placed under considerable stress on a daily basis, absorbing the pounding of walking, running, and jumping. Poorly-constructed and -cushioned shoes and obesity help contribute to stress fractures and general instability of the foot. High-impact sports that include twisting and direct blows to the feet increase the risk of fracture. Appropriate protective equipment will help decrease the risk of injury. Certain occupations increase the risk of foot injury. These include the construction trades in which weights may be dropped on a foot, or falls from height may occur. People with osteoporosis or peripheral neuropathy may have increased risk of foot injury. For these people, it is important to decrease the clutter around the house to prevent injury from falling. It is also helpful to limit the number of throw rugs in a home that can cause a person to trip and fall."
When should I call the doctor for foot pain?," Most of the bones in the foot will eventually heal with rest, but some fractures may need surgery to repair. Often, it is the mechanism of injury associated with the intensity of pain that makes the patient seek care. It is appropriate to seek medical care if the patient cannot walk normally without a limp. Medical care should be accessed immediately if an injury to the foot also includes a laceration. The term ""open fracture"", previously named ""compound fracture,"" describes a broken bone that is associated with a break in the skin. Open fractures pose a significant risk for major infection of the bone. Other reasons to seek care include:Numbness or tingling in the toes, which may be an indication of nerve damageA cool and white toot, which may signal artery damage and decreased blood supply to the foot Numbness or tingling in the toes, which may be an indication of nerve damage A cool and white toot, which may signal artery damage and decreased blood supply to the foot"
Facts you should know about diabetes foot problems,"   A number of different kinds of foot problems can occur in people with diabetes. Two main conditions, peripheral artery disease (PAD) and peripheral neuropathy, are responsible for the increased risk of foot problems in people with diabetes. Symptoms and signs of diabetic foot problems arise due to the decreased sensation from nerve damage as well as the lack of oxygen delivery to the feet caused by vascular disease. People with diabetes have an increased risk of ulcers and damage to the feet. Diabetic foot problems also include bunions, corns, calluses, hammertoes, fungal infections, dryness of the skin, and ingrown toenails. These problems are not specific to diabetes, but may occur more commonly due to the nerve and vascular damage caused by diabetes. Treatment depends on the exact type of foot problem. Surgery or even amputation may be required for some cases. Gangrene (dry gangrene) is tissue death due to absence of blood circulation. It can be life threatening if bacterial infection develops (wet gangrene). Many diabetes-related foot problems can be prevented by good control of blood sugar levels combined with appropriate care of the feet."
How can diabetes cause foot problems?,"'Both type 1 and ''type 2 diabetes'' cause damage to blood vessels and peripheral nerves that can result in problems in the legs and feet. Two main conditions, 1) peripheral artery disease (PAD), and 2) peripheral neuropathy are responsible for the increased risk of foot problems in people with diabetes.'   Peripheral artery disease (PAD), sometimes referred to as peripheral vascular disease (PVD), means that there is narrowing or occlusion by atherosclerotic plaques of arteries outside of the heart and brain. This is sometimes referred to as ""hardening"" of the arteries. Diabetes is a known risk factor for developing peripheral artery disease. In addition to pain in the calves during exercise (medically known as intermittent claudication), the signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease relate to a decreased delivery of oxygen to the lower legs and feet. In severe cases, the lack of oxygen delivery to tissues can result in ulcers and even gangrene (tissue death). Peripheral neuropathy refers to damage to the peripheral nerves directly as a result of diabetes. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy include decreased sensation in the nerves of the legs and feet, making it difficult to perceive injuries due to lack of feeling. Peripheral neuropathy also causes a tingling, pain, or burning in the involved areas. It can also cause the muscles of the feet to work improperly, leading to misalignment of the foot that can put pressure on certain areas of the foot."
What are the symptoms and signs of foot problems caused by diabetes?,"'In the most severe case, as mentioned above, due to a combination of decreased sensation and reduced blood flow to the feet, ulcers may develop. If the tissues continue to receive insufficient oxygen, tissue death (gangrene) occurs. Gangrene is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. Other potentially serious problems that may develop include ''cellulitis'' (infection of the tissues beneath the skin) and ''osteomyelitis'' (infection of the bone); ''sepsis'' (the infection spreads to the bloodstream) also is possible.''People with diabetes are at increased risk for milder problems with the feet that are not specific to diabetes but may occur more frequently due to problems with the nerves and circulation to the feet.''Some of these conditions are: (This list is not exhaustive.)'   Calluses and corns, that may develop due to abnormal alignment of the feet or abnormal gait Fungal infections of the nails, which can appear as thickened, discolored, and at times brittle nails Tinea pedis, or athlete's foot, a fungal infection of the skin of the feet Hammertoes, or bent toes due to muscle weakness. Bunions, or the angling of the big toe toward the second toe. The area of the bunion may become reddened and irritated, leading to callus formation. Ingrown toenails Cracking of the skin of the feet, especially the heels, due to dry skin"
What are treatment options for diabetes foot problems?,"'Treatment depends upon the type of foot problem. For example, some problems such as corns may require wearing corrective shoes, while others such as mild infections may be treated with antibiotics or antifungals. Other problems may need surgical debridement and antibiotics. Gangrene, or tissue death, cannot be reversed, but treatments are available to prevent gangrene (often termed dry gangrene) from spreading or becoming infected (dry gangrene becomes infected and develops into wet gangrene). Surgical removal of the dead tissue is typically required, and antibiotics are given to prevent the development of life-threatening infections in the dead tissue. In severe cases of gangrene, amputation of the affected part may be necessary.''Other types of foot problems can be relieved by proper footwear, sometimes with orthotic devices, and splinting or bracing. For some conditions like hammertoes, bunions, and ingrown toenails; surgery may be necessary to correct severe cases.''Taking proper care of your feet (see ''Prevention'' section) can help prevent or relieve many common foot problems in people with diabetes.'  "
Is it possible to prevent diabetes-related foot problems?,"'Some diabetes foot-related problems can be prevented by taking careful steps to observe and care for your feet. Keeping blood ''sugar'' levels under control (in the ranges advised by your doctor), and following your recommended ''diet'' and ''exercise'' program are the best way to prevent all complications of diabetes, including foot problems. In addition to keeping your diabetes under control, you can take steps to care for your feet, including the following:'   Wear comfortable, closed-toe footwear at all times. Special shoes are available for people with bunions or foot deformities if these are necessary. Be sure no objects are trapped inside the shoes that could cut or injure your feet. Don't walk barefoot, even at home. Be sure your feet do not get burned by walking on very hot pavement in summer Always wash your feet with warm water and dry them well after washing. Check your feet daily for any sores or problems. Apply lotion to dry areas, especially heels, but don't use lotion between the toes. Corns and calluses can be lightly smoothed with a pumice stone. Never use scissors or razors to cut away corns or calluses. Trim toenails straight across, and do not cut the corners shorter than the rest of the nail. Be sure that your doctor checks your feet at every checkup. Stop smoking, if you are a smoker. Smoking further increases the risk of arteriosclerosis and poor circulation to the feet."
What is the prognosis for diabetes-related foot problems?,"'The outlook depends upon the severity of the foot problem. As mentioned before, gangrene can be life-threatening if bacterial infection develops in the dead tissue area. Severe gangrene may result in the necessity for amputation of the affected area. Other foot problems are less severe but may nevertheless lead to reduced function or discomfort. Patients need to understand that for the best outcome of foot problems caused by diabetes is life-long monitoring of their feet for problems and consulting their doctor immediately if a problem begins to develop.'  "
What is the design of the foot?,"'The foot is an intricate structure of 26 bones, 33 joints, multiple muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics. The bones form two crossing arches of the foot. The longitudinal arch runs the length of the foot, and the transverse arch runs the width. The ankle joint is formed by the interaction of the foot and the lower leg, and the toes are on the far side of the foot. The bones of the foot are primarily held together by their fit with each other forming joints surrounded by joint capsules and connected by fibrous tissues known as ligaments. The muscles of the foot, along with a tough, sinewy tissue known as the plantar fascia, provide secondary support to the foot and the longitudinal arch. The foot has internal muscles that originate and insert in the foot and external muscles that begin in the lower leg and attach in various places on the bones of the foot. There are also fat pads in the foot to help with weight-bearing and absorbing impact.\xa0 Various tendons in the foot act together to provide synchronized pull on a bone or joint structures. This allows the foot to remain in optimal alignment. The foot is also covered by dense soft tissue structures that include capsule, subcutaneous fat, dermal, and epidermal layers. These soft tissue structures work as a unit to function as a primary defense mechanism from external hazards such as infection and ''trauma''. The soft tissue can allow fluid to accumulate, which can cause swelling in the foot.''The foot is the foundation of movement of the lower extremity.\xa0 It is an intricate and complex system that provides efficient ''shock'' absorption and propulsion in order for us to walk and run.\xa0 Pain in the foot indicates that there is something wrong with either the interaction of internal structures of the foot or with how the foot is interacting with external influences. How and when the pain occurs and the locations of the pain are the primary clues to what may be causing the pain. When there is pain, the body reacts by changing the way it moves or functions in an effort to reduce the pain. These compensations or biomechanical changes may prevent the normal movement and cause further injury in the foot and/or other parts of the body.' "
What causes foot pain?,"'Foot pain may be caused by many different diseases, deformities, biomechanical conditions, improper footwear, or injuries.'   Infectious disease, viruses, fungi, and bacteria can cause foot pain. Plantar warts on the bottom of the foot are caused by a virus and can cause irritation and pain. Athlete's foot, which is caused by a fungus, can lead to foot irritation and pain. A common cause of foot pain is an ingrown toenail. Ingrown toenails occur when the edges of the nail grow through or into the skin, resulting in pain and often leading to infection. Patients with diabetes are more prone to infection since their immune system is compromised. Many systemic diseases such as diabetes, lupus, gout, and rheumatoid arthritis can cause foot pain. Rheumatoid arthritis can cause painful inflammation in the joints of the foot, accompanied by alignment changes that lead to foot deformities. Deformities, such as tarsal coalitions, calcaneal varus, calcaneal valgus, bunions, claw toes, mallet toes, hammertoes, and bone spurs, are common causes of foot pain. Biomechanical abnormalities from muscle and tendon tightness or laxity, flat feet, or high arched feet often lead to muscle imbalances, deformities, and foot pain. Trauma from an acute injury or from accumulative repetitive injury is a very common cause of foot pain, as well.  An example of such an injury is Achilles tendonitis or rupture.  The tendon can rupture from an acute, sudden injury or it can become inflamed (tendinitis) from repetitive insult to the structure.  Injuries to the skin and internal structures may also be caused by small repetitive traumas or pressures. Micro-trauma injuries can be caused by running on uneven surfaces or surfaces that are too hard or too soft, or by wearing shoes that have poor force-absorption qualities, are not activity-specific, or fit incorrectly. Wearing shoes that are too tight or high heels can cause pain in the forefoot. Shoes that are tied too tightly can cause pain and bruise on the top of the foot. Improper, non-sport specific shoes for running or cycling can lead to foot pain with activities. Poorly fitting shoes in the short term can cause blisters, bruising, and be a source of athlete's foot. The long-term effects of poorly fitting shoes may be bunions, corns, calluses, irritation of nerves and joints, and misalignment of the toes. Morton's neuroma caused by the thickening of tissue around a nerve between the toes can cause toe numbness and pain and may also be aggravated by ill-fitting shoes as can many foot deformities such as hammertoes, mallet toes, and bunions."
What causes foot pain? (Continued)," Injuries such as ligament sprains, muscle strains, bruises, and fractures typically occur suddenly (acutely). Sprains, strains, bruises, and fractures may be the result of a single or combination of stresses to the foot. A sprain of the foot or ankle occurs when ligaments that hold the bones together are overstretched and their fibers tear or stretch too far. The looseness of ligaments in the joints of the foot may lead to chronic foot pain, joint instability, and deformity. Repeated overstressing of the same structure of the foot may cause stress fractures, tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, and acute and chronic osteoarthritis. Stress fractures commonly occur in the metatarsal bones, the long bones of the foot, and can occur in the tarsal or rear foot bones, as well. These fractures are often called march fractures because it is often caused by non-distinct and minor stress of excessive walking (marching) rather than a large traumatic event.  The muscles and fascia of the foot can be strained by overstretching, overuse, or overloading. Achilles tendonitis is a common injury of the tendon that attaches at the back of the heel. Plantar fasciitis (the most common cause of heel pain) is a result of micro-trauma strain to the large ligament called the plantar fascia. Tendon pain and swelling from repetitive abnormal strain lead to tendinitis, which can eventually lead to tears in the tendons. Injury to the bones and joints of the foot can be caused by a single blow or twist to the foot or also by repetitive trauma that can result in a stress fracture. A blunt-force injury such as someone stepping on your foot may result not only in a bruise (contusion) injury but also damage to the muscles and ligaments of the foot. Direct blows to the foot can cause bruising, breaking of the skin, or even fracturing of bones. Metatarsalgia is from the repetitive irritation of the joints of the ball of the foot. The term ""stone bruise"" is commonly referred to as a specific localized pain and tenderness of the ball of the foot. ""Turf toe"" is a common athletic injury in which the tendon and capsule under the joint at the base of the big toe is strained. Trauma to the toenail can cause pooling of blood under the nail and the temporary or permanent loss of a toenail. Repetitive trauma to the bones, muscles, and ligaments can result in extra bone growth known as spurs or exostoses. Delayed treatment of many foot pain can lead to complications, chronic long-term pain, disability, and arthritis of the affected foot."
What other symptoms and signs may accompany foot pain?,"'Pain and point tenderness is the immediate indicators that something is wrong in a specific area. Swelling, redness (erythema), bruising (ecchymosis), numbness/tingling, and shooting pains may also present localized to the injured area. The onset of pain, whether suddenly or over time, is an important indicator of the cause of the problem. The following questions are also important.''Bones of the foot are joined together by ligaments. A sprain occurs when the ligaments that hold the bones together are overstretched and the fibers tear. Point tenderness and looseness of a joint can be indicators of a sprain.\xa0 Ligament injury is often accompanied by a sense of instability when walking or exercising.''Injury to the bones of the foot can be caused by a single blow or twist to the arch or also by repetitive trauma that can result in a ''stress fracture''. There may be a distinguishable lump or gap at the site of a ''fracture''. The ''fracture'' can be accompanied by dislocation of involved joints.\xa0 In such circumstances, the joint alignments are disrupted in addition to a break in the bone. ''Fracture'' and dislocation are common causes of post-traumatic arthritis. This is due to additional injury to joint cartilage.''Muscles and tendons allow movement of the foot in various directions. A strain occurs when a muscle or group of muscles are stressed to the point where there is tearing of the muscle fibers. The muscles and tendons of the foot may be strained by overstretching, overuse, overloading, bruising, or even being lacerated. ''Weakness'' in the contraction of a joint, difficulty in stabilizing body parts, and pain working against resistance are signs of muscle problems. Swelling, tenderness, loss of function, and discoloration over and around the injury can be symptoms and signs of a strain.''Bruises (''contusions'') are most commonly the result of a direct impact injury to the body. A bruise can occur to the foot by a variety of causes, such as having your foot stepped on or by stepping on a rock. Blows to the foot that result in pain, discoloration, swelling, and changes in how you walk may indicate more serious damage such as ''fractured bone''.''Pain and tenderness associated with plantar fascia strains are usually felt on the bottom of the foot between the heel and the base of the toes. Plantar fascia pain may be increased or decreased by stretching of the arch. In mild cases of plantar fasciitis, the pain will decrease as the soft tissues of the foot ""warm-up,"" however, pain may increase as the use of the foot increases. In more severe cases of plantar fasciitis, pain may increase when the arch is stressed. Often the sufferer of plantar fasciitis will feel pain in the morning until the plantar fascia warms up. Foot pain at night may be a sign of plantar fasciitis, as well as other possible problems.\xa0Plantar fasciitis can cause a shift in the weight-bearing surface in order to avoid pain, which may cause compensation pain in the other areas of the heel.''A sensation of rubbing or burning on the surface of the foot is usually the first sign of a ''blister''. ''Itching'' and burning sensations between the toes or around the foot indicate a ''skin infection'' or '""athlete's foot""'. Pain and redness at the edge of a toenail are usually the results of an ''ingrown toenail''.'   Is there pain with movement of the affected area? Is it affected by weight-bearing? Does it change your walking motion?"
When should someone seek medical treatment for foot pain?,"'When the pain begins to interfere with your activities of daily living or if you cannot perform your desired activities without pain, you should consider seeking medical attention. Indicators that you should seek medical care are if the area looks deformed, you have a loss of function, change of sensation, a large amount of swelling with pain, prolonged change of skin or toenail color, the affected area becomes warmer than the surrounding areas, becomes exquisitely tender to the touch, or is causing you to move differently.\xa0Experiencing little to no improvement with a few days or rest, ice, and temporary ''pain reliever'' suggests that the injury will not likely heal on its own.\xa0 It is not recommended to “push through” the pain since this can worsen the injury.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose foot pain?,"'Proper evaluation and diagnosis of foot pain are essential in planning treatment. A good general guideline is to compare the injured side to the uninjured side. Injury may present itself as a distinguishable lump or gap felt at that location or a ""crunchy"" feeling on that spot caused by inflammation. The types, causes, and severity (sharp pain versus a dull ache) also are good indicators of the seriousness of the injury.\xa0Comparing functional ability to the unaffected side also provides insight into the nature and severity of the injury.''There are four grades of pain:''The doctor will ask you several questions to determine how the problem began. It can be helpful to tell the physician about how and when it started, how it affects you, when it bothers you, what you may or may not have done to make the pain better or worse. If necessary, a thorough physical exam may be conducted to evaluate for any other injuries.'   During activity Before and after, and not affecting performance Before, during, and after athletic activity, affecting performance Pain so severe that performance is impossible Feet will be physically and visually examined at rest, with weight- and non-weight-bearing movement by the medical professional. The foot and arch will be touched and manipulated and inspected to identify obvious deformities, swelling, tender spots, or any differences in the bones of the foot and arch. The medical professional will examine how the muscles of your foot function. These tests may involve holding or moving your foot and ankle against resistance; you may also be asked to stand, walk, or even run. The skin will be inspected for any signs of bruising, break in skin or infection. The nerves in the foot will be tested to make sure no injury has occurred there.  An X-ray, MRI, or bone scan of the foot and arch may be taken to determine if there are abnormalities of the bone and/or soft tissues. A blood test may be ordered to rule out systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or diabetes."
What is the treatment for foot pain?,"'Treatments are optimally directed toward the specific cause of the pain.''When you first begin to notice discomfort or pain in the area, you can treat yourself with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). ''Over-the-counter'' medications may also be used to reduce discomfort and pain.''Rest will allow the tissues to heal by preventing any further stress to the affected area. Crutches should be used if you have difficulty putting weight on the foot. Appropriate use of commercially available ankle and foot supports may provide rest, comfort, and support to the affected area.''Ice should be applied no longer than 20 minutes. The ice may be put in a ''plastic'' bag or wrapped in a towel. Commercial ice packs are not recommended because they are usually too ''cold''. If extreme discomfort occurs, the icing should discontinue immediately. Alternatively, one can soak the affected limb in cool water mixed with Epsom salt.''Compression and elevation will help prevent any swelling of the affected tissues.\xa0 Excessive swelling can cause stretching of the nerve fibers in the affected area, which can cause more pain.\xa0 Therefore, decreasing swelling often provides some degree of pain relief.\xa0\xa0''There are two types of over-the-counter medications that may help with the pain and swelling of foot pain. ''Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') will help reduce the pain, while a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (''NSAID'') such as ''aspirin'', ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin''), or ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn'') can help lessen the pain and as well as reduce the inflammatory response. Caution should be taken when using these anti-inflammatory medications as the dosage should not exceed the labeled directions. In addition, individuals with a history of ''acid reflux'' or ''stomach ulcer'' and kidney problems should consult a medical doctor prior to using them.\xa0''A popular home remedy for relief of plantar fasciitis is rolling a frozen water bottle on the ground with the bottom of the foot.\xa0 Various stretching exercises are known to be beneficial.\xa0 Proper shoe gear with supportive insert is also beneficial, as well as avoiding going barefoot.\xa0 A ''corticosteroid'' injection can be helpful.''Blisters occur as a result of ''chafing''. These ""hot spots"" should be attended to immediately with padding or friction reducers. If these spots progress to a blister and are unbroken, the doctor can drain them by puncturing from the side with a clean needle, and once drained, the skin will act as a natural bandage and should not be trimmed away. If the skin over the blister is broken, the loose skin should be peeled back and the area should be treated as an ''open wound''. Blisters should be covered and padded before returning to activity; in simple cases, a Band-Aid may solve the problem. If the blister is bigger, donut pads, gel pads, or commercially available blister pads may be more appropriate. To avoid ''blistering'' in the future, a generous application of petroleum jelly or anti-chafing topical cream to the affected area can be helpful. Shoe sizing should be assessed as well as sock construct and material. Synthetic cotton combinations can provide a wicking effect to reduce moisture and friction.\xa0 It is also possible to sustain blisters from contact-related ''allergy''.\xa0 In such cases, it is important to identify the causative agent and to avoid contact with the agent in the future.\xa0 The topical or oral steroids may be necessary to relieve pain and ''itching'' caused by these ''allergic'' blisters.'  "
What is the medical treatment for foot pain?,"'Once the severity and cause of foot pain are determined, a course of corrective and rehabilitative actions can be started.' Qualified medical personnel may use electrical medical devices such as ultrasound, various forms of electrical stimulation, LED light therapy (laser), and/or manual therapies to reduce pain and increase circulation to the area to promote healing. Cast or boot immobilization can provide adequate rest.  Prolonged periods of immobilization can cause muscle weakness and joint stiffness.  This is managed by various forms of physical therapy. Maintenance of fitness levels via modification of activity may be prescribed.Substitute activities that aggravate the pain and soreness. Running causes the body to have repetitive high-impact with the ground. Bicycling and/or using elliptical trainers, step machines, swimming, or ski machines minimizes impact and allows you to maintain and improve your fitness.

What follow-up care is needed after foot pain is treated?,"'There may be follow-up tests, scans, or ''X-rays''. A plan for a gradual return to play should be started once the pain is reduced and muscle strength and flexibility are restored.\xa0Temporary bracing and use of custom orthotic device may become necessary to gradually return to pre-injury activity level.' "
Is it possible to prevent foot pain?,"'To prevent injuries and pain, the following issues should be addressed before starting an ''exercise'' routine. Are you in good health? A general physical exam by a physician will help to evaluate your cardiovascular function, the possibility of disease, or any other general medical problems that you may have. Before beginning activities, diseases such as ''gout'', diabetes, certain types of arthritis, and neuropathies should be treated.''Physicians with sports medicine, physical medicine, podiatric, or orthopedic backgrounds may also help you choose an appropriate activity. After choosing the sport or activity that you wish to participate in, proper preparation will help minimize the initial aches and pains of that activity. Proper technique in any activity will help you to properly and safely perform your chosen activity and avoid injury. Good coaching can help you develop good biomechanics that can prevent foot pain.''Shoes and socks appropriate to your activity will also be a deterrent to foot pain. Properly fitting shoes and proper foot hygiene can prevent blisters, ''ingrown toenails'', ''corns'', ''calluses'"", bunions, stress fractures, metatarsalgia, Morton's neuroma, mallet toes, and plantar fasciitis. Poorly fitting footwear can make poor biomechanics worse, and properly fitting footwear can help to minimize the effect of bad biomechanics.""'A plan for a gradual return to play should be started once the pain is reduced and muscle strength and flexibility are restored. Returning to participation and ''prevention'' of foot pain are governed by the same factors as preparing for participation. Foot pain can be caused by doing too much of a particular activity too fast. Ignoring pain can also lead to further ''foot problems''. Different types of foot pain can be seen at different times of the season. Typically, blisters, ''shin splints'', Charley horse (''muscle spasms''/''cramps''), and arch injuries occur at the beginning of the sports season.''Stress-related foot problems are related to the workloads. If the body is not prepared for an increase of workload that is typical early in the season and with ""weekend warriors,"" acute shin splints and tendonitis are very common, in addition to increased muscle soreness.\xa0 A stress fracture can result from a sudden increase in workload.\xa0''After foot pain has been successfully treated, an optimal workout program begins with a physical exam by a physician, followed by a gradual, consistent workout plan. A good example of this type of program is a running program that starts with a good warm-up, such as walking five to 10 minutes, then alternating sets of jogging and walking. An example of such a program would be 20 sets of jogging for two minutes, then walking one minute, with jogging time increased until you can run continuously for 40 minutes. Good surfaces and proper equipment used in your workout will lower the risk of foot pain.''Components of a good ''exercise'' program should include core strengthening, muscle strengthening, and stretching specific to the goals of the workout program or the sport.''If pain is encountered when working out, try decreasing the intensity or duration of the workout. If the pain persists, then you should immediately stop and seek medical advice to discover the source of the pain. Pushing through the pain often results in injury.' "
Facts you should know about diabetes foot problems,"   A number of different kinds of foot problems can occur in people with diabetes. Two main conditions, peripheral artery disease (PAD) and peripheral neuropathy, are responsible for the increased risk of foot problems in people with diabetes. Symptoms and signs of diabetic foot problems arise due to the decreased sensation from nerve damage as well as the lack of oxygen delivery to the feet caused by vascular disease. People with diabetes have an increased risk of ulcers and damage to the feet. Diabetic foot problems also include bunions, corns, calluses, hammertoes, fungal infections, dryness of the skin, and ingrown toenails. These problems are not specific to diabetes, but may occur more commonly due to the nerve and vascular damage caused by diabetes. Treatment depends on the exact type of foot problem. Surgery or even amputation may be required for some cases. Gangrene (dry gangrene) is tissue death due to absence of blood circulation. It can be life threatening if bacterial infection develops (wet gangrene). Many diabetes-related foot problems can be prevented by good control of blood sugar levels combined with appropriate care of the feet."
How can diabetes cause foot problems?,"'Both type 1 and ''type 2 diabetes'' cause damage to blood vessels and peripheral nerves that can result in problems in the legs and feet. Two main conditions, 1) peripheral artery disease (PAD), and 2) peripheral neuropathy are responsible for the increased risk of foot problems in people with diabetes.'   Peripheral artery disease (PAD), sometimes referred to as peripheral vascular disease (PVD), means that there is narrowing or occlusion by atherosclerotic plaques of arteries outside of the heart and brain. This is sometimes referred to as ""hardening"" of the arteries. Diabetes is a known risk factor for developing peripheral artery disease. In addition to pain in the calves during exercise (medically known as intermittent claudication), the signs and symptoms of peripheral artery disease relate to a decreased delivery of oxygen to the lower legs and feet. In severe cases, the lack of oxygen delivery to tissues can result in ulcers and even gangrene (tissue death). Peripheral neuropathy refers to damage to the peripheral nerves directly as a result of diabetes. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy include decreased sensation in the nerves of the legs and feet, making it difficult to perceive injuries due to lack of feeling. Peripheral neuropathy also causes a tingling, pain, or burning in the involved areas. It can also cause the muscles of the feet to work improperly, leading to misalignment of the foot that can put pressure on certain areas of the foot."
What are the symptoms and signs of foot problems caused by diabetes?,"'In the most severe case, as mentioned above, due to a combination of decreased sensation and reduced blood flow to the feet, ulcers may develop. If the tissues continue to receive insufficient oxygen, tissue death (gangrene) occurs. Gangrene is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. Other potentially serious problems that may develop include ''cellulitis'' (infection of the tissues beneath the skin) and ''osteomyelitis'' (infection of the bone); ''sepsis'' (the infection spreads to the bloodstream) also is possible.''People with diabetes are at increased risk for milder problems with the feet that are not specific to diabetes but may occur more frequently due to problems with the nerves and circulation to the feet.''Some of these conditions are: (This list is not exhaustive.)'   Calluses and corns, that may develop due to abnormal alignment of the feet or abnormal gait Fungal infections of the nails, which can appear as thickened, discolored, and at times brittle nails Tinea pedis, or athlete's foot, a fungal infection of the skin of the feet Hammertoes, or bent toes due to muscle weakness. Bunions, or the angling of the big toe toward the second toe. The area of the bunion may become reddened and irritated, leading to callus formation. Ingrown toenails Cracking of the skin of the feet, especially the heels, due to dry skin"
What are treatment options for diabetes foot problems?,"'Treatment depends upon the type of foot problem. For example, some problems such as corns may require wearing corrective shoes, while others such as mild infections may be treated with antibiotics or antifungals. Other problems may need surgical debridement and antibiotics. Gangrene, or tissue death, cannot be reversed, but treatments are available to prevent gangrene (often termed dry gangrene) from spreading or becoming infected (dry gangrene becomes infected and develops into wet gangrene). Surgical removal of the dead tissue is typically required, and antibiotics are given to prevent the development of life-threatening infections in the dead tissue. In severe cases of gangrene, amputation of the affected part may be necessary.''Other types of foot problems can be relieved by proper footwear, sometimes with orthotic devices, and splinting or bracing.

Keeping blood ''sugar'' levels under control (in the ranges advised by your doctor), and following your recommended ''diet'' and ''exercise'' program are the best way to prevent all complications of diabetes, including foot problems. In addition to keeping your diabetes under control, you can take steps to care for your feet, including the following:'   Wear comfortable, closed-toe footwear at all times. Special shoes are available for people with bunions or foot deformities if these are necessary. Be sure no objects are trapped inside the shoes that could cut or injure your feet. Don't walk barefoot, even at home. Be sure your feet do not get burned by walking on very hot pavement in summer Always wash your feet with warm water and dry them well after washing. Check your feet daily for any sores or problems. Apply lotion to dry areas, especially heels, but don't use lotion between the toes. Corns and calluses can be lightly smoothed with a pumice stone. Never use scissors or razors to cut away corns or calluses. Trim toenails straight across, and do not cut the corners shorter than the rest of the nail. Be sure that your doctor checks your feet at every checkup. Stop smoking, if you are a smoker. Smoking further increases the risk of arteriosclerosis and poor circulation to the feet."

What are the signs and symptoms of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'The symptoms of swollen feet and swollen ankles depend on the underlying causes mentioned above.'   In general, swelling caused by dependent edema, pregnancy, medications, and most diseases produce swelling that is bilateral (present in both feet or ankles ) and usually begins as a soft, puffy skin enlargement in the feet that spreads rapidly (often within hours) to the ankles. The skin is easily indented when pressed down with a finger and slowly returns to its more puffy state when the finger pressure is removed. Indentations seen in the puffy skin when shoes or socks are removed are classic signs of swelling. The skin color with this swelling is often normal or slightly pale; indentation marks are slightly darker than the surrounding swollen tissue. Many individuals can simply position themselves on their backs, elevate their feet and ankles higher than their hearts, and after some time (often a few hours), the swelling may resolve completely. However, in some chronic diseases and with some medications taken for long time periods, the swelling becomes chronic and the skin becomes more rigid, reddish and sometimes mildly discolored or mottled and will not return to normal after a few hours of elevation. For example, many people with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) will have chronic bilateral swelling of feet and ankles with skin changes."
What are common causes of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'Swollen ankles and swollen feet have numerous causes. Medically, the word ""swollen"" means protuberant or abnormally distended. Thus, if an ankle or foot is swollen, means it is increased in size. In most common situations, when the word swollen is used in reference to feet and ankles, the user implies the distention or size increase is due to an increase of fluid in the tissues (also termed edema). However, the broad definition includes any factors that increase ankle or foot size (for example increased or excess fluids, increased inflammatory cells or both). Because the majority of factors that cause foot swelling also may cause ankle swelling, this article will discuss swelling as a general topic to cover both foot and ankle swelling. Some of the few exceptions where only foot or ankle swelling occur without both being involved will be discussed. Swollen feet and ankles usually are a symptom or sign of some underlying problem, the majority of which are not a major cause for concern. However, in some instances, foot, ankle, and toes swelling may warn a person that an underlying problem needs immediate medical attention.''The causes of swollen feet and ankles are numerous; examples of the most of the major causes include:''Picture of ''pitting edema'   Dependent swelling (or edema): swelling due to standing or walking (usually over some time period that varies from person to person) Pregnancy: the normal swelling that most pregnant women experience during pregnancy Medications (side effects): Many medications have the side effects of fluid retention that manifests as swelling. Although the reader is advised to check their individual medications for side effects of swelling, general drug categories that may cause swelling include anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids and NSAIDs), hormones, medications for people with diabetes, antidepressants, and many calcium channel blockers (anti-hypertensive and cardiac medications). Injury: Any trauma to the foot or ankle (usually sprains or fractures) can result in swelling. Diseases: heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease (all of these diseases can influence fluid mobilization in the body by physical, metabolic and electrolyte-water interactions) Infection: any infection, either localized (abscess) or diffuse (cellulitis) Lymphedema: swelling due to lymph vessel or lymph node blockage of lymph fluid Blood clot(s): blockage of blood vessels (usually venous) that cause fluid to leak out of vessels into tissue"
Who is at risk for swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'A large number of people are at risk for swollen ankles and feet. Below are listed the causes and those people at risk:' Dependent swelling (or edema): people who are standing or walking for long periods like salespersons, mothers with children, construction workers, obese individuals, and individuals with underlying health problems (see below) Pregnancy: most normal pregnant females, especially in the last trimester. Medications (side effects): people taking anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids and NSAIDs), hormones, medications for people with diabetes, antidepressants, and many calcium channel blockers (anti-hypertensive and cardiac medications). Injury: any person with trauma to the foot or ankle Diseases: Patients with heart disease (especially congestive heart failure), liver disease, kidney disease (all of these diseases can influence fluid mobilization in the body by physical, metabolic and electrolyte-water interactions) Infection: any person infected, either localized (abscess) or diffuse (cellulitis)of the foot or ankle Lymphedema: Persons with lymph vessel or lymph node blockage of lymph fluid, due to infections, trauma or surgical procedures Blood clot(s): People with blockage of blood vessels (usually venous) that cause fluid to leak out of vessels into tissue There are other causes that are less frequent and intermittent (for example, gout or hairline ankle fractures)."
What medical conditions cause symptoms of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'Occasionally, ''specific medical problems'' will show additional or relatively unique symptoms, for example:''Injury or infection'' of the ankle is usually unilateral, but can be bilateral. Injury or infection is often, in the early stages, limited to either the foot or the ankle, but may spread to each other. Swelling due to trauma usually is localized to the injured area (for example, ''ankle sprain'' or ''plantar fasciitis'' in the foot); in some instances, the swollen skin area may be damaged by ''abrasion'', ''laceration'', or ''bruised''. ''Pain'' usually accompanies traumatic foot or ankle injury. Some infections of the foot or ankle may show localized swelling due to abscess formation (tight smooth skin, warm, and sometimes oozing pus) while other infections (cellulitis) show generalized swelling and warm skin, often with redness of the skin. ''Pain'' often is present where infection is located.' Symptoms of gout include swelling of the big toe with redness, warmth and pain, arthritis with swelling and joint pain, or electrolyte imbalance with low magnesium causing foot and leg cramps. Sudden appearance of bilateral feet and ankle swelling during pregnancy (usually after 20 weeks) can be the first symptoms noticed in females with preeclampsia. Unilateral swelling of the foot or ankle usually has the same symptoms described above if the underlying cause is unilateral lymphedema, venous insufficiency or blood clots. However, with blood clots there is often pain generated when the swollen area has pressure applied to the area. Chronic venous insufficiency often has skin changes in color and texture as described above but may also develop skin ulcers or secondary infections."
How do medical professionals diagnose swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"""Clinical observation and examination is the way swollen feet and ankles are diagnosed. A health care professional will likely ask questions about the swelling to obtain specific information and gain insight into the underlying cause of the swelling; once the cause is determined, treatments can be designed to help the patient. Simple observation and a patient's verbal description of the swollen area may be enough to presumptively diagnose the cause. For example:""'Laboratory tests are usually not used to diagnose feet and ankle swelling; however, they may be needed to be ordered in some patients to help diagnose underlying causes of the swelling. ''X-rays'' may be used to determine underlying fractures while ''CTs'' or ''MRI''s may reveal the extent of tissue damage.''Some mild hand and/or foot swelling can resolve without treatment, while other patients can be treated by their primary care doctors. Depending on the underlying cause of the swelling, such specialists as internal medicine, orthopedics, sports medicine, infectious disease, OB/GYN and cardiologists are some examples of specialists that may be consulted.' a swollen ankle that the patient ""twisted"" a day ago is probably due a sprain; a swollen foot that is warm with reddish skin in a person with diabetes, with a small cut on the foot is likely caused by an infection; a bilateral foot and ankle swelling in a cardiac patient who did not take the prescribed diuretics is probably caused by a combination of dependent edema, poor fluid management and decreased cardiac function."
What is the treatment for swollen feet and swollen ankles?,"'The treatment for swollen feet and ankles depends on the underlying cause(s). For many people, simply raising their feet above their ''heart'' or simply getting off their feet regularly during the day will reduce or eliminate the swelling. However, for many other people, treatment of the underlying cause of the swelling may include antibiotics for infections, a splint or wrap for a sprain, taking appropriate medications for ''CHF'' or ''gout''.''Emergent and urgent treatment is infrequent for foot or ankle swelling itself, but does occur for certain underlying causes where feet and ankle swelling or localized swelling is an important symptom and sometimes the major symptom. Examples include''Anytime the swelling is accompanied by other major symptoms such as ''shortness of breath'', ''chest pain'' or ''fever'', a health care professional (emergency department or EMS) should be contacted immediately.'   preeclampsia in pregnancy, heart failure exacerbations, liver failure, kidney failure, foot and ankle fractures, abscesses, cellulitis, and gout exacerbations."
What home remedies help soothe symptoms of swollen ankles or feet?,"""One of the best home remedies for swollen ankles, feet, and toes is to elevate the swollen extremity slightly above the level of the heart. This is easily done by having the person lie down face up on a bed or couch, and then place pillows under the heels so the feet and ankles so they are higher than the person's chest.""'Sitting on a plane seat or on the office chair (or for hours at a time anywhere!) may cause lower extremity swelling. Periodic leg muscle movement by extension and contraction by simply by occasionally walking will help. Some physicians also recommend wearing support hose or compression stockings. Other suggestions are listed in the prevention section below.'  "
What are the complications of swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'Swollen feet and ankles can lead to discomfort and pain when walking or ''running'' is attempted. Chronic swelling can lead to skin color changes and skin ulcers. The skin ulcers can occasionally become infected. The skin infections can be further complicated by abscess formation, cellulitis, ''necrotizing fasciitis'', and death.' "
Is it possible to prevent swollen ankles and swollen feet?,"'In many situations, the swelling in feet and ankles can be reduced or prevented. The following is a list of ways to reduce or prevent ankle and feet swelling:''Because there are so many underlying causes of feet and ankle swelling, there are numerous ways to avoid or reduce the chances for their development. The reader is urged to follow up on this article by reading about ways to prevent underlying causes of swelling.' Exercise to improve circulation and fluid distribution Eat a healthy diet; too much salt may cause fluid retention, high blood pressure (hypertension), and swelling Interrupt sitting or standing several times a day and elevate the feet and ankles above the heart Lose excess weight to lessen water retention and decrease the build-up of pressure on muscles and joints Consider using support stockings or hose Examine prescription and other medications; consult with the doctor if medication may be responsible for fluid retention Avoid smoking, alcohol and other substances that can lead to underlying causes of swelling"
What is the prognosis for swollen feet and swollen ankles?,"'The majority of people with swollen feet and ankles have a good to excellent outcome because the swelling is usually reversible and has no lasting complications. However, a significant number of patients who have underlying causes that are chronic and refractory to treatment have a wider range of prognosis (good to poor) depending on how well the patient responds to both lifestyle changes and medications.' "
How are foreign bodies removed?,"'Most foreign bodies are usually removed at home; however, in certain situations, medical intervention becomes necessary.' Removing foreign bodies from the skin: They are usually removed through a pair of tweezers, but care should be taken to sterilize it with alcohol and the wound may also be cleaned to avoid any chances of infection. If the wound is dirty or large due to the presence of a foreign body, immediate medical attention may be required.  Removing foreign bodies from the eyes: They are usually removed through flushing saline solution by blinking. If the object has sharp edges or if chemicals are involved, immediate medical attention may be required. Removing foreign bodies from the ears: They are usually removed by positioning the head toward gravity. Patients may also be able to remove an object using tweezers; however, one should never probe the ear because this can damage the eardrum. If patients have pain or hearing problems, immediate medical assistance may be required. Removing foreign bodies from the throat, airways, and stomach: Once the object is visualized using imaging techniques, doctors may use endoscopy to remove the object. The tube may usually have a camera, and doctors may send operating tools through the tube to remove the lodged foreign body. This is usually done under local or general anesthesia. Surgery: In rare cases, open surgery may be required where it is hard to remove foreign objects from difficult places."
When should I seek medical attention?,"'It is important not to cause yourself further damage while attempting to remove any foreign bodies yourself. If you cannot cleanly remove the object with your hands or tweezers, it is important to seek medical help. Avoiding further damage will be vital in the proper healing of the areas affected by a foreign body.''Some examples include:''If you are experiencing discomfort due to a foreign object or are unsure of the cause, it is important to seek medical attention to avoid further damage. If the object causes ''breathing'' difficulties, the individual should be immediately sent to a hospital.' A nail or sharp object in the foot Swallowed magnets or batteries A small object in the nose (more commonly found in children) The discomfort of the eye The feeling of a clogged ear Severe pain or bleeding Infection"
When should I decide about breastfeeding?,"""Generally, it is a good idea for the new mom to meet with the baby's doctor prior to the birth in order for all to get to know each other in a controlled, non-rushed, quiet environment. This is a perfect opportunity to discuss your concerns and wishes about feeding your baby. One important reason to have the decision to breastfeed made before the delivery is that it can be very difficult or even impossible to start using formula and then later try to switch to breast milk. This is because the ability of the breasts to produce milk diminishes soon after ""'childbirth'' without the stimulation of breastfeeding.'  "
Why is the choice so important?,"""During your baby's first year of life, he/she will more than triple his/her total body weight, and the vast majority of this ""'weight gain'' will come from the milk that he/she ''drinks''. According to the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'', human milk is the preferred feeding for all infants. This includes premature and sick newborns, with rare exceptions. Of course, breast milk would appear to be the most ideal food for your ''newborn''. Breast milk is the food least likely to cause ''allergic'' reactions, it is inexpensive, it is readily available at any hour of the day or night; ''babies'' accept the taste readily; and the immunity factors in breast milk can help the baby fight off some infections.''Although breast milk is the ideal food for human infants, because of medical or other reasons, some women opt for formula feeding. ''Infant formulas'' have been developed to artificially duplicate human milk, although no formulas have been developed that are an exact replacement for human milk.' "
What are the disadvantages and benefits of breastfeeding?,"'The nutritional advantages of breast milk are certainly numerous. The amino acids in breast milk, the building blocks of proteins, are well balanced for the human baby, as are the sugars (primarily lactose) and ''fats'"". The baby's intestinal tract is best aided in its digestion by the ""'vitamins'', enzymes, and minerals found in breast milk. Breast milk also contains infection-fighting antibodies from the mother, and breastfed babies are believed to be at a reduced risk for many acute and chronic infections early in life. The ''cholesterol'' content is also high in human milk and very low in formulas. Cholesterol promotes brain growth and provides the building blocks of hormones, ''vitamin D'', and intestinal bile.''Breast milk is also the least expensive way to feed an infant. However, the mother must maintain good ''nutrition'' and continue taking any vitamin/mineral ''supplements'' her doctor recommended during the pregnancy.''Formula-fed babies may also have the risk of developing an ''allergy'' to a particular formula. When a baby develops an ''allergy'' to formula, he or she may have symptoms that include irritability, crying after feedings, ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', or a skin ''rash''. Concerns that your baby is having a formula ''allergy'"" should be discussed with your baby's doctor.""'Nursing helps most women ''lose weight'' (though not fluid) after delivery, as 500 calories or more are used by breastfeeding each day. Women who breastfeed also have a reduced risk for postpartum bleeding and a reduced risk for ovarian and ''breast cancer'' in the future.''Breastfeeding facilitates bonding between mother and baby. There is a well-accepted extra closeness that breastfeeding mothers experience that is both hormonal and emotional in nature.''The only disadvantages for the baby in breastfeeding occur when things are not going well, for example, if there\'s an inadequate supply of breast milk or an inefficient suck reflex in the baby. However, it is unusual for a mother not to produce enough milk for her baby unless she is not breastfeeding correctly or frequently enough. The disadvantages that most commonly arise involve the rest of the family. Siblings and dad sometimes feel ""left out"" of baby care since mom is the only one who can do the nursing. However, other family members can be involved in helping with different aspects of the baby\'s care, and this gives them a valuable feeling of importance and allows mom a chance to rest.''Breastfed babies eat more often than formula-fed babies since breast milk is more quickly digested and leaves the stomach empty more frequently. This puts a little more ''stress'"" on the mother because of the potential necessity for more frequent feedings. If the mother develops certain medical conditions, whether or not to continue breastfeeding may need to be reassessed. These conditions should always be discussed with the doctor. However, it is rare that breastfeeding would need to be discontinued completely. In any interaction, the mother's doctor and/or pharmacist should be informed that she is breastfeeding. Some medicines should be avoided during breastfeeding. Numerous other medications have not yet been adequately studied in the context of breastfeeding and the possible effects on the baby. If a breastfeeding mother is required to take a medication which has not been fully studied, she may want to consider discussing this matter with her doctor."" "
What are the advantages and disadvantages of formula feeding?,"""For some parents, or when the baby has certain medical conditions, it is very important to know exactly how much their baby is receiving at each feeding, and formula/bottle-feeding allows exact measurement. Foods, medications, or physical conditions in the mother are no longer a concern for the baby who is receiving formula. The entire family can immediately become intimately involved in all aspects of the baby's care, including feedings, allowing the mother to get more rest. Formula-fed babies actually need to eat somewhat less often since formula is less readily digested by the baby than human milk. The disadvantages of formulas are primarily their expense, the lack of maternal infection-fighting antibodies that are in breast milk, and the fact that no formula can exactly duplicate the ideal composition of breast milk."" "
"Can 
I use both forms of feedings for my baby?","""According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, exclusive breastfeeding is ideal nutrition and sufficient to support optimal growth and development for approximately the first 6 months after birth. Furthermore, it is recommended that breastfeeding continue for at least 12 months, and thereafter for as long as mutually desired. Infants weaned before 12 months of age should not receive cow's milk feedings but should receive iron-fortified ""'infant formula''.''Supplementing breastfeeding with formula is usually discouraged, although it may be helpful in cases where the mother is not producing an adequate supply of milk or the baby is not able to breastfeed well.''Lactation aids are also available as an option to avoid using a bottle when supplementation is necessary.' "
Is there any special preparation required for breastfeeding?,"'Education about the benefits and practice of breastfeeding are keys to optimal preparation. Your local hospital may offer breastfeeding classes as part of the ''childbirth'' class, or you can join your local La Leche League or other breastfeeding support group. These classes can put you in touch with a lactation specialist who may later be your personal lactation consultant. These classes can also help you to learn proper positioning and latch-on techniques.''Contrary to some popular beliefs, it is not necessary to stimulate or prepare the nipples in advance for breastfeeding. Moreover, some techniques of stimulating the nipples may actually be harmful.''No specific physical preparation is necessary for optimal breastfeeding, although some doctors may want to know about things like inverted nipples or previous breast surgery even before the baby is born. General good health measures and adequate hydration are helpful measures. Most doctors recommend continuing basic ''prenatal vitamins'' while breastfeeding.' "
When can breastfeeding begin?,"'Breastfeeding can begin within minutes after birth for most babies. Most babies take a few licks or sucks and then pause at the beginning. Frequent bursts of sucking interrupted by pauses is the usual pattern for the first few hours and sometimes even the first few days.''The first milk the mother produces, called colostrum, is the best food for a newborn. The ''nipple'' stimulation that occurs during breastfeeding also helps the uterus contract and can help stop uterine bleeding.''When a baby begins to open its eyes, look around, and put his or her fist into his or her mouth, then it is time to offer your breast. Breastfeeding experts recommend that the baby not be given ''sugar'' water or other types of bottle feedings in the hospital unless specifically prescribed by the doctor. Some experts recommend not starting a pacifier until good breastfeeding is established.' "
What is the proper technique for breastfeeding?,"'Observing other breastfeeding mothers and talking with breastfeeding support organizations can help new breastfeeding mothers learn techniques for optimal breastfeeding that can help reduce the likelihood of any discomfort or complications. These techniques are briefly outlined below.'""After the mother has assumed a position comfortable for her, she can nestle the baby in a cradle hold (cradling the baby with the mother's arm on the same side as the breast being presented). The baby's body should be on its side, so that the baby does not have to turn his or her head to reach the nipple."" First, manually express a few drops of milk to moisten the nipple. Cup the breast with your hand and using the milk-moistened nipple, gently massage baby's lips, encouraging the baby to open its mouth. When the baby's mouth is opened, the nipple is inserted into the center of the baby's mouth while pulling the baby in very close. The baby's gums should take in at least a 1-inch radius of the areola. The mother may have to make adjustments for the baby's breathing by changing the angle of baby's position slightly or using the thumb to press gently on the breast to uncover the baby's nose. Hold the breast throughout the feeding so the weight of your breast does not tire your newborn's mouth. When feeding is over, to avoid trauma to your nipples, do not pull your nipple from baby's mouth without first breaking the suction by inserting your finger into the corner of baby's mouth."
When should I use a breast pump?,"'Many women find the convenience of a breast pump to be an invaluable aid in breastfeeding. Basically, breast pumps allow the nursing mother to expel (and store, if desired) breast milk at times when she is not available to nurse the breastfed baby.''There are different types of breast pumps. Large, dual-action pumps are typically used in the hospital setting and may be rented for home use. The options for personal use and purchase include automatic models that are comparable to hospital-grade pumps, small electric or battery-operated units that double- or single-pump, and one-handed manual pumps.''Breast pumps may be useful for working mothers who wish to provide a supply of breast milk for their newborn and keep up their own milk production. Sometimes, women must stop breastfeeding on a temporary basis due to an infection or need to take certain medications. In these cases, use of a breast pump can keep milk production active during the breastfeeding hiatus.' "
Should I eliminate certain foods from my diet while breastfeeding?,"""Some babies appear to be sensitive to certain foods in the mother's ""'diet'', while other babies never appear to have negative reactions to foods. A baby may become fussy, may have trouble sleeping, or may develop ''gas'' after the mother eats certain types of foods with strong flavors. Some of the most common triggers of fussiness in babies include ''chocolate'', spices, citrus fruits, and gas-causing vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, and broccoli. However, not all babies will have a reaction to particular foods.''Most experts recommend limiting consumption of ''caffeine'' while breastfeeding, since high levels of ''caffeine'"" can make the baby fussy or disturb the baby's ""'sleep'' patterns. Having more than one alcoholic beverage is also not recommended, since two or more alcoholic ''beverages'' at one time can increase blood ''alcohol'' levels to a point where the alcohol enters the breast milk. If a nursing mother consumes more than two drinks, she should wait at least 2 hours until nursing the baby to allow for elimination of alcohol from the body. If the breasts become engorged, it is fine to pump and discard breast milk while waiting. Studies have also shown that alcohol can interfere with the body\'s ability to ""let down"" (enable the free flow of breast milk) during breastfeeding.''Symptoms of allergy'' in a nursing baby may or may not be due to something eaten by the mother. If an ''allergic reaction'"" to mother's food is present in the baby, it usually develops 2-6 hours after the mother consumed the offending food.""'Because of concerns about ''mercury poisoning'', the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommend that nursing mothers limit their exposure to mercury in fish. The FDA and EPA advise eating no more than 6 oz. (about 1 serving) of canned albacore or ""white"" tuna a week and limiting intake of canned ""light"" tuna and other cooked fish to about 12 oz. (about 2 servings) per week. Nursing mothers should completely avoid eating shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish (also called golden or white snapper) because of potentially high levels of mercury.' "
Clogged milk ducts,"'Clogged milk ducts may appear as small, red, tender lumps within the breast. Milk ducts may become clogged with dried milk or other material. The goal of treatment is opening these blocked ducts. This can be aided by increasing the breastfeeding frequency and offering the affected breast first, as well as pumping the breast after breastfeeding if the baby is not emptying the breast.''Moist heat packs can be applied to the affected area to increase blood flow and healing. A warm shower and massaging of the area may also enhance resolution of this problem.''Sometimes, the baby will refuse the affected breast because the milk develops a sour taste. Pump the breast and empty it as well as possible. Continue to offer that breast to the baby until he/she accepts the affected breast again.' "
Sore nipples,"'Sore nipples can be relieved by exposing the nipples to the air as much as possible. Using a hair dryer on a low setting to dry nipples after breastfeeding may also provide relief. Nipples should be washed only with water, never with soap, alcohol, benzoin, or premoistened towelettes. Petroleum-based ointments and other cosmetic preparations should not be used, but unmedicated lanolin may help alleviate nipple cracking.' "
When should one seek medical care for problems with breastfeeding?,"'It is important to call your health care provider if the above techniques do not alleviate the problem or if you develop serious symptoms such as ''fever'' or signs of ''mastitis'' (a breast inflammation that may be caused by an infection). Symptoms of mastitis include increasing ''pain'' in the breast, ''fever'', ''chills'', sweats, ''breast swelling'' and/or hardness, and redness of the skin over the affected area. A delay in treating mastitis could lead to a more severe infection and possible breast ''abscess''.' "
Can supplements or medications increase a low milk supply?,"'Most experts agree that increasing the number of feedings and receiving coaching and assistance on proper breastfeeding technique can help increase what is perceived to be a low milk supply. Some women find that using breast pumps after each feeding stimulates milk production because of the increased degrees of emptying of the breast.''Medications that are reported to increase milk production are known as galactogogues. The most common examples are ''dopamine'' receptor antagonists (such as ''metoclopramide'' [''Reglan'', Reglan ODT, ''Metozol ODT'', Octamide] and ''domperidone''). However, there have been no data to demonstrate that these ''drugs'' are more effective than interventions that focus on improving breastfeeding technique and increasing breastfeeding frequency. Most doctors do not support the use of these medications to augment milk supply.''Although a number of ''dietary supplements'' and/or herbal preparations have been claimed to stimulate milk production, including alfalfa, ''fenugreek'', or blessed thistle, there is little scientific data to support the claims that any herbal or dietary supplement can significantly increase milk production, and safety data on the use of these ''supplements'' in nursing mothers is incomplete.' "
Is it possible to breastfeed while pregnant?,"'While breastfeeding typically is associated with a decrease in ''fertility'', it is possible to become ''pregnant'' while breastfeeding, and breastfeeding does not provide 100% effective ''birth control''. For most women, it is safe to continue breastfeeding if they desire, provided they ensure that they are receiving adequate nutrition and fluid intake. While breast milk from a pregnant mother is still nutritionally strong, the hormonal changes of pregnancy will result in some changes in the content of the breast milk and the way the breast milk tastes.''Some women who have had premature ''labor'' in previous ''pregnancies'' may be advised to stop breastfeeding if they become pregnant. This is because the stimulation of the nipples that occurs during breastfeeding may trigger contractions of the uterus. In a woman prone to preterm ''labor'', these weak uterine contractions might increase her risk of developing preterm ''labor''. Both pregnancy and breastfeeding place high demands on the body in terms of nutritional support and rest. Other women may be advised to stop breastfeeding during pregnancy if their nutritional status is poor or if they are suffering from extreme ''fatigue'"" due to the pregnancy. These decisions should be made with advice from the mother's doctor."" "
Is smoking harmful when breastfeeding?,"'Tobacco smoking'' is always harmful, and all mothers should be encouraged to ''quit smoking'' prior to pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, ''smoking'' cigarettes is not considered to be a reason for not breastfeeding, since breastfeeding is the optimal nutrition for newborns. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics\' policy statement on breastfeeding, ""tobacco ''smoking'' by mothers is not a contraindication to breastfeeding, but health care professionals should advise all tobacco-using mothers to avoid ''smoking'' within the home and to make every effort to wean themselves from tobacco as rapidly as possible.""''Nursing mothers should understand that ''nicotine'' is passed to the baby in breast milk, and they should never nurse their baby immediately after smoking or while smoking. Babies exposed to ''secondhand smoke'' also are at risk for a number of health issues, so if a woman smokes, she should nurse her baby after smoking, in a room away from ''cigarette'' smoke. Of course, the safest policy for both mother and baby is to abstain from tobacco use while breastfeeding and forever thereafter.' "
"Do breast implants, surgeries, or reductions affect breastfeeding?","'Strictly speaking, neither ''breast augmentation'' surgery nor ''breast reduction'"" surgery are indications that a woman should not breastfeed. However, all types of breast surgery can interfere with milk production. In women who have received implants, the location of the implant and the type of incision used in the procedure will determine the extent, if any, to which the implant may affect breast milk production or nursing ability. In some cases, operations on a woman's breast may have involved incisions in the nipple area (such as surgeries for biopsies), and in these cases, the milk ducts may have been disrupted. Surgical disruption of milk ducts and ""'scar tissue'' may also predispose women to plugged ducts, mastitis, or milk retention ''cysts'' during breastfeeding.''Concerns have been expressed in the past that the content of ''breast implants'' (particularly with silicone implants) could leak out and be absorbed into breast milk, but studies have failed to show that this is a risk. Ideally, a woman who is planning breast surgery should discuss in advance with her surgeon the risks that the procedure may pose to future breastfeeding.' "
How should one wean a baby from breastfeeding?,"'Weaning is the process of transitioning from breastfeeding to other sources of nourishment. There are no established standards on when to wean a baby, although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies receive only breast milk for the first 6 months of life and a combination of solid foods and breast milk until the baby is at least 1 year old.''Sometimes babies will signal their mothers that it is time to begin weaning; they may nurse for shorter periods of time or appear indifferent, fussy, or distractible when nursing. Other babies may even be resistant to weaning even when the mother is ready. As babies begin to eat more solid foods, their consumption of breast milk may decrease, making breast engorgement less of a problem for the mother.''Weaning does not have to take place all at once. For example, a woman may choose to continue breastfeeding only in the evening, and to wean during the day. Weaning is also easier when the baby has been exposed to another source of milk, such as taking breast milk from a bottle.''No matter when weaning occurs, experts suggest that the process take place gradually. Many women wean by dropping one breastfeeding session a week. Slowing down the process can also help milk production gradually decrease, making engorgement less of a problem. Some mothers prefer to leave the weaning process up to the child; when a child is eating solid foods at every meal, there is often a decreased interest in breastfeeding.' "
What does sexual arousal mean?,"'Sexual arousal is being sexually excited. Everyone’s sex drive is different, and there is no quantifying how much amounts to normal sex. Everyone’s sexual desire and interests are different and can change over time.''The strong emotional connection between a couple may arouse them sexually (demisexual). However, some people may not need any emotional connection to have sex with the other person. Some people don’t feel any sexual attraction towards anyone known as asexual.''The levels of your sexual desire (also known as libido) may affect your overall physical and emotional wellbeing, relationship satisfaction, ''body image'', and sex hormones levels as well as the desire to express love, give or receive pleasure, or create any relationship.''Sexuality starts in your mind. Your brain is responsible for making you feel interested in sex through emotional thoughts, imaginations, or feelings.' "
What does the sexual response cycle mean?,"'The sexual response cycle is a sequence of bodily and emotional changes that occur in a person when he/she becomes sexually aroused and participates in sexual activities including intercourse (insertion of the penis into the woman’s vagina) and masturbation (stimulation of the genitals with the hand for sexual pleasure).''You can enhance your relationship by knowing your body’s sexual responses during each phase of your sexual response cycle. It may also help you to identify the cause of any sexual problem.''Sexual arousal is very different in men and women, both psychologically and physiologically. There are four ''phases of sexual response'' in both.' "
What are the erogenous zones?,"'Certain areas of your body are highly sensitive due to lots of nerve endings and make you feel excited or aroused when they’re touched are known as erogenous zones, such as clitoris in women, and penis, scrotum, and anus in men.''Other pleasurable zones often include the breast and nipples in women, the chest and nipples in men, and mouth, earlobes, neck, and inner thighs in both. However, erogenous zones are located all over the body. You may discover new pleasures by exploring all the body’s erogenous zones.' "
What happens when you have a heart attack?,"'A ''heart attack'' occurs when the blood vessel that supplies blood to your ''heart'' (coronary artery) gets blocked – partially or completely. The lack of blood supply means the heart does not get enough oxygen or nutrients. When you experience a heart attack, the signs and symptoms include:' Chest discomfort in the form of pressure, heaviness, tightness, squeezing, or pain Chest pain that goes into your back, jaw, throat, or arm Fullness in the stomach or indigestion (it may feel like heartburn) Shortness of breath Sweating Stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting Dizziness Severe weakness Fatigue Fast and/or irregular heart rate"
What are the four signs of an impending heart attack?,"'Some ''heart attacks'' are sudden and severe. But most begin slowly with chest discomfort as the first sign. You need to pay attention if you experience the following warning signs of a heart attack. These signs are as suggested by the American Heart Association (AHA):''Chest discomfort''\xa0''Discomfort in other areas of the upper body.''\xa0''Shortness of breath.''\xa0''Other possible signs include\xa0' Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes.  Sometimes, you may have chest discomfort that goes away and then returns. You may feel uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. You feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, and jaw. You may also get a stomachache. You may suffer from shortness of breath with or without chest discomfort. Breaking out in a cold sweat  Nausea  Lightheadedness"
What does a mini heart attack feel like?,"'You must have often heard of other people having something called a “mini heart attack” or mild heart attack. Although there is no such term as a “mini” heart attack in the medical dictionary, it can be compared with a mild heart attack or a silent heart attack.''Mild heart attack\xa0''Silent heart attack\xa0\xa0' You get a mild heart attack when there is a partial block in your coronary artery that causes mild signs and symptoms of a heart attack.  If your doctor tells you that you have had a mild heart attack, it probably means your heart is not damaged much and is working properly. Sometimes, you may not even know that you have suffered a heart attack. Such a heart attack is usually said to be a silent heart attack. Your doctor accidentally may discover a past attack on your routine ECG (electrocardiogram) when you go for your regular check-up.  While in other instances, a heart problem or another heart attack could make the doctor suspect that you may have had a silent heart attack. This may similarly show up in your ECG when you visit your doctor for a different heart problem. Such a heart attack might have occurred months or years before without you even knowing about it.  A silent heart attack is usually lacking the typical signs and symptoms of a heart attack, such as shortness of breath. Symptoms of a heart attack like mild pain in the throat or chest can be confused with hyperacidity, indigestion, and heartburn."
What are the tests to diagnose a heart attack?,"'ECG'': An ECG is one of the most common tests. It allows a doctor to get a sense of how severe your heart attack was and which part of your heart has been damaged.\xa0''Blood tests'': Presence/level of various enzymes in your blood like creatine phosphokinase (CPK), CPK-MB and troponin can indicate the extent of damage to your ''cardiac muscle''.''Echocardiography'': This test is done during and after the heart attack to check if the heart attack has damaged your heart valves and determine the pumping capacity of your heart.\xa0''Cardiac catheterization'': You may be asked to go urgently for ''angiography'', which is done with the help of a surgical procedure known as cardiac catheterization. This will let the cardiac surgeon know the location of the block in the coronary artery to help him decide the most appropriate treatment for your heart attack.' "
How is a heart attack treated?,"'Specific medicines may be taken (within one or two hours from the start of your heart attack) to limit heart damage.''Medicinal ''drugs'' used during a heart attack may include:''If medications fail to improve the signs and symptoms of heart attack, either of the following cardiac surgeries will be planned by the cardiac surgeon.''Angioplasty'': A procedure to open the narrowed or blocked arteries supplying blood to the heart. This can be done immediately after angiography on the same day.''Bypass surgery (''coronary artery bypass graft'')'': A procedure in which the surgeon takes blood vessels taken from another area of your body and uses them to bypass the blocked/narrowed arteries to enable re-supply of blood to the affected areas of the heart. This surgery is usually planned a few days after a heart attack.' Aspirin  Clopidogrel Prasugrel Ticagrelor   Streptokinase Heparin"
What Is the Growth Plate?,"'The growth plate, also known as the epiphyseal plate or physis, is the area of growing tissue near the end of the long bones in children and adolescents. Each long bone has at least two growth plates: one at each end. The growth plate determines the future length and shape of the mature bone. When growth is complete--sometime during adolescence--the growth plates close and are replaced by solid bone. ' "
Who Gets Growth Plate Injuries?,"'These injuries occur in children and adolescents. The growth plate is the weakest area of the growing skeleton, weaker than the nearby ligaments and tendons that connect bones to other bones and muscles. In a growing child, a serious injury to a joint is more likely to damage a growth plate than the ligaments that stabilize the joint. An injury that would cause a sprain in an adult can be associated with a growth plate injury in a child. ''Injuries to the growth plate are ''fractures''. They comprise 15 percent of all childhood fractures. They occur twice as often in boys as in girls, with the greatest incidence among 14- to 16-year-old boys and 11- to 13-year-old girls. Older girls experience these fractures less often because their bodies mature at an earlier age than boys. As a result, their bones finish growing sooner, and their growth plates are replaced by stronger, solid bone. ''Approximately half of all growth plate injuries occur in the lower end of the outer bone of the forearm (radius) at the wrist. These injuries also occur frequently in the lower bones of the leg (tibia and fibula). They can also occur in the upper leg bone (femur) or in the ankle, foot, or hip bone. '  "
What Causes Growth Plate Injuries? ,"'While growth plate injuries are caused by an acute event, such as a fall or a blow to a limb, chronic injuries can also result from overuse. For example, a gymnast who practices for hours on the uneven bars, a long-distance runner, or a baseball pitcher perfecting his curve ball can all have growth plate injuries.''In one large study of growth plate injuries in children, the majority resulted from a fall, usually while ''running'' or playing on furniture or playground equipment. Competitive sports, such as football, basketball, softball, track and field, and gymnastics, accounted for one-third of all injuries. Recreational activities, such as biking, sledding, skiing, and skateboarding, accounted for one-fifth of all growth plate fractures, while car, motorcycle, and all-terrain-vehicle accidents accounted for only a small percentage of fractures involving the growth plate. ''Whether an injury is acute or due to overuse, a child who has ''pain'' that persists or affects athletic performance or the ability to move or put pressure on a limb should be examined by a doctor. A child should never be allowed or expected to ""work through the ''pain''."" '""Children who participate in athletic activity often experience some discomfort as they practice new movements. Some aches and pains can be expected, but a child's complaints always deserve careful attention. Some injuries, if left untreated, can cause permanent damage and interfere with proper growth of the involved limb. ""'Although many growth plate injuries are caused by accidents that occur during play or athletic activity, growth plates are also susceptible to other disorders, such as bone infection, that can alter their normal growth and development. ''Adapted from ''Play It Safe, a Guide to Safety for Young Athletes'' with permission of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. ' Child abuse can be a cause of skeletal injuries, especially in very young children, who still have years of bone growth remaining. One study reported that half of all fractures due to child abuse were found in children younger than age 1, whereas only 2 percent of accidental fractures occurred in this age group.  Injury from extreme cold (for example, frostbite) can also damage the growth plate in children and result in short, stubby fingers or premature degenerative arthritis.  Radiation, which is used to treat certain cancers in children, can damage the growth plate. Moreover, a recent study has suggested that chemotherapy given for childhood cancers may also negatively affect bone growth. The same is true of the prolonged use of steroids for rheumatoid arthritis.  Children with certain neurological disorders that result in sensory deficit or muscular imbalance are prone to growth plate fractures, especially at the ankle and knee. Similar types of injury are seen in children who are born with insensitivity to pain.  The growth plates are the site of many inherited disorders that affect the musculoskeletal system. Scientists are just beginning to understand the genes and gene mutations involved in skeletal formation, growth, and development. This new information is raising hopes for improving treatment of children who are born with poorly formed or improperly functioning growth plates.  Inability to continue play because of pain following an acute or sudden injury  Decreased ability to play over the long term because of persistent pain following a previous injury  Visible deformity of the child's arms or legs  Severe pain from acute injuries that prevent the use of an arm or leg.

""""Since the 1960's, the Salter-Harris classification, which divides most growth plate fractures into five categories based on the type of damage, has been the standard. The categories are as follows: ""'The epiphysis is completely separated from the end of the bone or the metaphysis, through the deep layer of the growth plate. The growth plate remains attached to the epiphysis. The doctor has to put the fracture back into place if it is significantly displaced. Type I injuries generally require a cast to keep the fracture in place as it heals. Unless there is damage to the blood supply to the growth plate, the likelihood that the bone will grow normally is excellent.''This is the most common type of growth plate fracture. The epiphysis, together with the growth plate, is separated from the metaphysis. Like type I fractures, type II fractures typically have to be put back into place and immobilized. ''This fracture occurs only rarely, usually at the lower end of the tibia, one of the long bones of the lower leg. It happens when a fracture runs completely through the epiphysis and separates part of the epiphysis and growth plate from the metaphysis. Surgery is sometimes necessary to restore the joint surface to normal. The outlook or prognosis for growth is good if the blood supply to the separated portion of the epiphysis is still intact and if the fracture is not displaced. ''This fracture runs through the epiphysis, across the growth plate, and into the metaphysis. Surgery is needed to restore the joint surface to normal and to perfectly align the growth plate. Unless perfect alignment is achieved and maintained during healing, prognosis for growth is poor. This injury occurs most commonly at the end of the humerus (the upper arm bone) near the elbow. ''This uncommon injury occurs when the end of the bone is crushed and the growth plate is compressed. It is most likely to occur at the knee or ankle. Prognosis is poor, since premature stunting of growth is almost inevitable. ''A newer classification, called the Peterson classification, adds a type VI fracture, in which a portion of the epiphysis, growth plate, and metaphysis is missing. This usually occurs with an ''open wound'' or ''compound fracture'', often involving lawnmowers, farm machinery, snowmobiles, or gunshot wounds. All type VI fractures require surgery, and most will require later reconstructive or corrective surgery. Bone growth is almost always stunted. '  "
What Kind of Doctor Treats Growth Plate Injuries?,"'For all but the simplest injuries, the doctor may recommend that the injury be treated by an orthopaedic surgeon (a doctor who specializes in bone and joint problems in children and adults). Some problems may require the services of a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon, who specializes in injuries and musculoskeletal disorders in children. ' "
How Are Growth Plate Injuries Treated?,"'As indicated in the previous section, treatment depends on the type of fracture. Treatment, which should be started as soon as possible after injury, generally involves a mix of the following: ''The affected limb is often put in a cast or splint, and the child is told to limit any activity that puts pressure on the injured area. '""If the fracture is displaced, the doctor will have to put the bones or joints back in their correct positions, either by using his or her hands (called manipulation) or by performing surgery (open reduction and internal fixation). After the procedure, the bone will be set in place so it can heal without moving. This is usually done with a cast that encloses the injured growth plate and the joints on both sides of it. The cast is left in place until the injury heals, which can take anywhere from a few weeks to two or more months for serious injuries. The need for manipulation or surgery depends on the location and extent of the injury, its effect on nearby nerves and blood vessels, and the child's age. ""'These treatments may also be recommended after the fracture is healed. '""Long-term followup is usually necessary to monitor the child's recuperation and growth. Evaluation includes x rays of matching limbs at 3- to 6-month intervals for at least 2 years. Some fractures require periodic evaluations until the child's bones have finished growing. Sometimes a growth arrest line may appear as a marker of the injury. Continued bone growth away from that line may mean that there will not be a long-term problem, and the doctor may decide to stop following the patient. ""  "
What Is the Prognosis for Growth in the Involved Limb of a Child With a Growth Plate Injury?,"'About 85 percent of growth plate fractures heal without any lasting effect. Whether an arrest of growth occurs depends on the following factors, in descending order of importance: ''Treatment depends on the above factors and also bears on the prognosis. ''The most frequent complication of a growth plate fracture is premature arrest of bone growth. The affected bone grows less than it would have without the injury, and the resulting limb could be shorter than the opposite, uninjured limb. If only part of the growth plate is injured, growth may be lopsided and the limb may become crooked. ''Growth plate injuries at the knee are at greatest risk of complications. Nerve and blood vessel damage occurs most frequently there. Injuries to the knee have a much higher incidence of premature growth arrest and crooked growth. ' Severity of the injury--If the injury causes the blood supply to the epiphysis to be cut off, growth can be stunted. If the growth plate is shifted, shattered, or crushed, a bony bridge is more likely to form and the risk of growth retardation is higher. An open injury in which the skin is broken carries the risk of infection, which could destroy the growth plate.  Age of the child--In a younger child, the bones have a great deal of growing to do; therefore, growth arrest can be more serious, and closer surveillance is needed. It is also true, however, that younger bones have a greater ability to remodel.  Which growth plate is injured--Some growth plates, such as those in the region of the knee, are more responsible for extensive bone growth than others.  Type of growth plate fracture--The five fracture types are described in the section, How Are Growth Plate Fractures Diagnosed? Types IV and V are the most serious. "

These centers provide the resources for established, currently funded investigators who are often from different disciplines, to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to common research problems in musculoskeletal disorders.' Use of therapies to enhance the body's production of chondrocytes. These cells are essential to growth at the ends of the bones.

What Is the Growth Plate?,"'The growth plate, also known as the epiphyseal plate or physis, is the area of growing tissue near the end of the long bones in children and adolescents. Each long bone has at least two growth plates: one at each end. The growth plate determines the future length and shape of the mature bone. When growth is complete--sometime during adolescence--the growth plates close and are replaced by solid bone. ' "
Who Gets Growth Plate Injuries?,"'These injuries occur in children and adolescents. The growth plate is the weakest area of the growing skeleton, weaker than the nearby ligaments and tendons that connect bones to other bones and muscles. In a growing child, a serious injury to a joint is more likely to damage a growth plate than the ligaments that stabilize the joint. An injury that would cause a sprain in an adult can be associated with a growth plate injury in a child. ''Injuries to the growth plate are ''fractures''. They comprise 15 percent of all childhood fractures. They occur twice as often in boys as in girls, with the greatest incidence among 14- to 16-year-old boys and 11- to 13-year-old girls. Older girls experience these fractures less often because their bodies mature at an earlier age than boys. As a result, their bones finish growing sooner, and their growth plates are replaced by stronger, solid bone. ''Approximately half of all growth plate injuries occur in the lower end of the outer bone of the forearm (radius) at the wrist. These injuries also occur frequently in the lower bones of the leg (tibia and fibula). They can also occur in the upper leg bone (femur) or in the ankle, foot, or hip bone. '  "
What Causes Growth Plate Injuries? ,"'While growth plate injuries are caused by an acute event, such as a fall or a blow to a limb, chronic injuries can also result from overuse. For example, a gymnast who practices for hours on the uneven bars, a long-distance runner, or a baseball pitcher perfecting his curve ball can all have growth plate injuries.''In one large study of growth plate injuries in children, the majority resulted from a fall, usually while ''running'' or playing on furniture or playground equipment. Competitive sports, such as football, basketball, softball, track and field, and gymnastics, accounted for one-third of all injuries. Recreational activities, such as biking, sledding, skiing, and skateboarding, accounted for one-fifth of all growth plate fractures, while car, motorcycle, and all-terrain-vehicle accidents accounted for only a small percentage of fractures involving the growth plate. ''Whether an injury is acute or due to overuse, a child who has ''pain'' that persists or affects athletic performance or the ability to move or put pressure on a limb should be examined by a doctor. A child should never be allowed or expected to ""work through the ''pain''."" '""Children who participate in athletic activity often experience some discomfort as they practice new movements. Some aches and pains can be expected, but a child's complaints always deserve careful attention. Some injuries, if left untreated, can cause permanent damage and interfere with proper growth of the involved limb. ""'Although many growth plate injuries are caused by accidents that occur during play or athletic activity, growth plates are also susceptible to other disorders, such as bone infection, that can alter their normal growth and development. ''Adapted from ''Play It Safe, a Guide to Safety for Young Athletes'' with permission of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. ' Child abuse can be a cause of skeletal injuries, especially in very young children, who still have years of bone growth remaining. One study reported that half of all fractures due to child abuse were found in children younger than age 1, whereas only 2 percent of accidental fractures occurred in this age group.  Injury from extreme cold (for example, frostbite) can also damage the growth plate in children and result in short, stubby fingers or premature degenerative arthritis.  Radiation, which is used to treat certain cancers in children, can damage the growth plate. Moreover, a recent study has suggested that chemotherapy given for childhood cancers may also negatively affect bone growth. The same is true of the prolonged use of steroids for rheumatoid arthritis.  Children with certain neurological disorders that result in sensory deficit or muscular imbalance are prone to growth plate fractures, especially at the ankle and knee. Similar types of injury are seen in children who are born with insensitivity to pain.  The growth plates are the site of many inherited disorders that affect the musculoskeletal system. Scientists are just beginning to understand the genes and gene mutations involved in skeletal formation, growth, and development. This new information is raising hopes for improving treatment of children who are born with poorly formed or improperly functioning growth plates.

Unless there is damage to the blood supply to the growth plate, the likelihood that the bone will grow normally is excellent.''This is the most common type of growth plate fracture. The epiphysis, together with the growth plate, is separated from the metaphysis. Like type I fractures, type II fractures typically have to be put back into place and immobilized. ''This fracture occurs only rarely, usually at the lower end of the tibia, one of the long bones of the lower leg. It happens when a fracture runs completely through the epiphysis and separates part of the epiphysis and growth plate from the metaphysis. Surgery is sometimes necessary to restore the joint surface to normal. The outlook or prognosis for growth is good if the blood supply to the separated portion of the epiphysis is still intact and if the fracture is not displaced. ''This fracture runs through the epiphysis, across the growth plate, and into the metaphysis. Surgery is needed to restore the joint surface to normal and to perfectly align the growth plate. Unless perfect alignment is achieved and maintained during healing, prognosis for growth is poor. This injury occurs most commonly at the end of the humerus (the upper arm bone) near the elbow. ''This uncommon injury occurs when the end of the bone is crushed and the growth plate is compressed. It is most likely to occur at the knee or ankle. Prognosis is poor, since premature stunting of growth is almost inevitable. ''A newer classification, called the Peterson classification, adds a type VI fracture, in which a portion of the epiphysis, growth plate, and metaphysis is missing. This usually occurs with an ''open wound'' or ''compound fracture'', often involving lawnmowers, farm machinery, snowmobiles, or gunshot wounds. All type VI fractures require surgery, and most will require later reconstructive or corrective surgery. Bone growth is almost always stunted. '  "
What Kind of Doctor Treats Growth Plate Injuries?,"'For all but the simplest injuries, the doctor may recommend that the injury be treated by an orthopaedic surgeon (a doctor who specializes in bone and joint problems in children and adults). Some problems may require the services of a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon, who specializes in injuries and musculoskeletal disorders in children. ' "
How Are Growth Plate Injuries Treated?,"'As indicated in the previous section, treatment depends on the type of fracture. Treatment, which should be started as soon as possible after injury, generally involves a mix of the following: ''The affected limb is often put in a cast or splint, and the child is told to limit any activity that puts pressure on the injured area. '""If the fracture is displaced, the doctor will have to put the bones or joints back in their correct positions, either by using his or her hands (called manipulation) or by performing surgery (open reduction and internal fixation). After the procedure, the bone will be set in place so it can heal without moving. This is usually done with a cast that encloses the injured growth plate and the joints on both sides of it. The cast is left in place until the injury heals, which can take anywhere from a few weeks to two or more months for serious injuries. The need for manipulation or surgery depends on the location and extent of the injury, its effect on nearby nerves and blood vessels, and the child's age. ""'These treatments may also be recommended after the fracture is healed. '""Long-term followup is usually necessary to monitor the child's recuperation and growth. Evaluation includes x rays of matching limbs at 3- to 6-month intervals for at least 2 years. Some fractures require periodic evaluations until the child's bones have finished growing. Sometimes a growth arrest line may appear as a marker of the injury. Continued bone growth away from that line may mean that there will not be a long-term problem, and the doctor may decide to stop following the patient. ""  "
What Is the Prognosis for Growth in the Involved Limb of a Child With a Growth Plate Injury?,"'About 85 percent of growth plate fractures heal without any lasting effect. Whether an arrest of growth occurs depends on the following factors, in descending order of importance: ''Treatment depends on the above factors and also bears on the prognosis. ''The most frequent complication of a growth plate fracture is premature arrest of bone growth. The affected bone grows less than it would have without the injury, and the resulting limb could be shorter than the opposite, uninjured limb. If only part of the growth plate is injured, growth may be lopsided and the limb may become crooked. ''Growth plate injuries at the knee are at greatest risk of complications. Nerve and blood vessel damage occurs most frequently there. Injuries to the knee have a much higher incidence of premature growth arrest and crooked growth. ' Severity of the injury--If the injury causes the blood supply to the epiphysis to be cut off, growth can be stunted. If the growth plate is shifted, shattered, or crushed, a bony bridge is more likely to form and the risk of growth retardation is higher. An open injury in which the skin is broken carries the risk of infection, which could destroy the growth plate.  Age of the child--In a younger child, the bones have a great deal of growing to do; therefore, growth arrest can be more serious, and closer surveillance is needed. It is also true, however, that younger bones have a greater ability to remodel.  Which growth plate is injured--Some growth plates, such as those in the region of the knee, are more responsible for extensive bone growth than others.  Type of growth plate fracture--The five fracture types are described in the section, How Are Growth Plate Fractures Diagnosed? Types IV and V are the most serious. "
What Are Researchers Trying To Learn About Growth Plate Injuries?,"'Researchers supported by the National Institutes of Health continue to seek better ways to diagnose and treat growth plate injuries and to improve patient outcomes.''Examples of such work include:''NIAMS currently funds Core Centers for Musculoskeletal Disorders at major medical centers. These centers provide the resources for established, currently funded investigators who are often from different disciplines, to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to common research problems in musculoskeletal disorders.' Use of therapies to enhance the body's production of chondrocytes. These cells are essential to growth at the ends of the bones. Research on drugs that protect the growth plate during radiation treatment. Identifying radiologic predictors for premature closure of the growth plate following fractures. By predicting the injuries most likely to result in arrested growth, doctors could opt to treat them differently and more aggressively. Research on cancer drugs to determine which ones are likely to affect the growth plates. Further investigating the mechanisms responsible for cartilage and growth-plate defects. Development of methods to regenerate musculoskeletal tissue by using principles of tissue engineering."

What is a broken toe?,'A commonly injured area of the foot is the small bones of the toes (phalanges). There are 26 bones in the foot; 19 are bones in the forefoot (five ''metatarsals'' and 14 phalanges). Trauma and the injury to the foot often causes one or more of the toe bones to break (fracture).' 
What are the symptoms of a broken toe?,"   Pain, swelling, or stiffness will occur in a broken toe following injury. It may be difficult to walk due to the pain, especially with a broken big toe. This is because the big toe bears much of the weight of the body during walking or pivoting. A broken little toe (pinky toe) may be painful, but usually does not limit the ability to walk. Other symptoms includea bruised toe,bruising of the skin aroundthe toe, anda bent or deformed appear-ance of the toe if the brokenbone is out of place. a bruised toe, bruising of the skin aroundthe toe, and a bent or deformed appear-ance of the toe if the brokenbone is out of place. Other problems may develop as a result of the fractured toe. Complications can occur immediately after the injury (minutes to days), or can develop much later (weeks to years). People with weakened bones"
What are the causes of a broken toe?,"'Trauma or injury such as stubbing the toe (jammed toe) or dropping a heavy object on the toe may cause a broken toe. The location of the toes (at the front part of the ''feet'') makes them the most likely part of the foot to be injured.''Prolonged repetitive movements, as in certain sports activities, can cause a type of broken type of broken toe called a ''stress fracture'' or hairline fracture. People with weakened bones (''osteoporosis'' or other disorders) may develop ''stress'' fractures simply from wearing improper shoes.' "
When to call a doctor if I think you have a broken toe,"'Many people think that if they can walk on an injured toe, it is not broken. This may not be the case. It is common to break a toe bone and still be able to walk on it.'""Go to a hospital's emergency department if you have following signs or symptoms.""'Call a doctor if any of the following occur:'   Any symptoms of a possible open (compound) fracture which include open wounds, bleeding, or drainage from near the broken toe Cold, numb, tingling, or unusual sensation in the toes Blue or gray colored skin near the injury If the injured toe appears deformed or is pointing in the wrong direction (angulated) If the broken toe pain worsens or new pain is not relieved by pain medication Sores, redness, or open wounds near the injured toe Bruising or bleeding under the toenail that causes significant pain A cast or splint is damaged or broken"
How can you tell if you have a broken toe?,"'Seek medical evaluation soon after the injury to ensure proper treatment and healing.''You initially may see a primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner or a child’s pediatrician when you first injure your toe. You likely will be referred to an orthopedist or orthopedic surgeon, who specializes in disorders of the musculoskelteal system, or a podiatrist, a specialist in conditions of the foot, for treatment.'""You also may be diagnosed with a broken toe in a hospital's emergency department by an ""'emergency medicine'' specialist. Radiologists will read an X-ray or MRI, though they will usually report back to your primary care physician or emergency medicine specialist and you will not directly consult with them.'   A doctor will ask questions to determine how the toe was injured and will examine the injured toe and possibly check for other injuries (for example, sprains). A doctor may take an X-ray to evaluate if the toe is broken or fractured. X-rays are not always necessary to diagnose a broken toe, especially if the break is in one of the smaller toes. Stress fractures, due to overuse or repetitive movement, may need an MRI to be diagnosed."
Can anything be done at home for a broken toe?,"'Most minor toe injuries can be treated at home. If a you are unsure or suspect a fracture, seek medical attention. The following self-care tips may help decrease pain and swelling from a broken toe, and to help the fracture heal properly.''In certain situations, a broken toe may need medical care such as maneuvering the toe back into place (reduction), casting, or splinting the toe.'   Rest: Avoid strenuous exercise, prolonged standing, or walking. Crutches may be needed, or a special shoe or boot to wear when walking to avoid putting weight on the fracture while it heals. Ice: Put ice in a plastic bag and apply it to the injury for 15-20 minutes every one to two hours for the first few days. Place a towel between the skin and the ice to protect the skin. Frozen peas or corn can also be used to ice the broken toe - they may conform to the fractured area better than ice. Elevation: To decrease swelling and pain, keep the foot raised above the level of the heart as much and as often as possible. Prop the foot up as much as possible (for example use several pillows), especially when sleeping. Reclining in a lounge chair is also helpful."
How to buddy tape a broken toe,"'If there is a minor or small fracture in a bone of one of the small toes, a doctor may only need to tape the injured toe to the one next to it for support. This treatment is called buddy taping.'""If the toe is buddy taped, it is usually safe to bathe, and then replace the tape afterward, however, check with the doctor prior to removing the tape to bathe. Always follow your doctor's instructions on how to tape your broken toe."" Put a small piece of cotton or gauze between the toes that are taped together. (This prevents the skin between the toes from developing sores or blisters.) Using as little tape as necessary, loosely tape the broken toe to the toe next to it. If the toes are taped too tightly it can cause additional swelling and may cut off circulation to the injured toe."
What is the medical treatment for a broken toe?,"'Depending on the location and severity of the toe fracture, the fracture may need to be put back into place (reduced) and splinted or casted. Because it has a significant weight bearing role, fractures of the big toe are often more serious and more likely to require reduction or surgical treatment. If there is an ''open wound'' near the injured toe, a ''tetanus'' shot and antibiotic medication may also be necessary.''If there is an open (compound) fracture of the toe, surgery may be necessary in some cases, and antibiotics will be given. This type of fracture should be seen by a doctor immediately.''Usually only anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' like ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'') are needed for pain. For severe injuries, the doctor may prescribe a stronger pain medicine.' "
Casting a broken toe," A cast usually is not required for a simple toe fracture. A hard-soled, sturdy, and supportive shoe or boot should be worn. A doctor may give the patient a special shoe to wear if the foot or toes are very swollen. A cast (or surgery) may be needed if the big toe is broken, a fracture involves a joint, several small toe fractures occur at once, or if a bone in the foot or leg is broken in addition to the toe."
Reduction for a broken toe," If the toe fracture is displaced (the two ends of the broken toe bone are out of place) or rotated (the toe is pointing in the wrong direction), or the toe is dislocated, the doctor may need to reduce it, or set the broken toe back into place. Sometimes local anesthesia may be needed to numb the toe before it is put back into place. After a reduction, a splint will be applied to the broken toe to hold it in place while it heals."
How long does it take for a broken toe to heal?,"'Talk to the doctor to have the broken toe evaluated to be certain it is healing properly. Call a doctor or go to an emergency department if any problems or complications develop before the scheduled appointment.''The healing time for broken toes usually is take about six weeks to heal. If problems last longer than six weeks, another X-ray may be needed, or the injury should be rechecked by the doctor to evaluate how the bone is healing. Simple toe fractures usually heal well with no problems. However, a severe fracture or a fracture that goes into a joint is at risk for developing arthritis, pain, stiffness, and possibly even a deformity.' "
What are the possible complications of a broken toe?,"'Other problems may develop as a result of the broken toe. Complications can occur immediately after the injury (minutes to days), or can develop much later (weeks to years). Inadequate treatment of a broken toe may lead to complications including foot deformities and ''chronic pain''. Even when a broken toe is treated promptly, complications may arise including:' Nail injury: A collection of blood may develop underneath the toenail called a subungual hematoma. If it is large, it may need to be drained. To drain a subungual hematoma a doctor will make a small hole in the toenail to drain the blood. If the hematoma is very large or painful, the entire toenail may need to be removed. The injury may also result in a broken toenail that may need to be trimmed or removed. Compound fracture: Rarely, the broken bone in a toe fracture may stick out through the skin. This is called an open or compound fracture. Emergency medical treatment and surgery may be necessary. Arthritis: After the toe fracture heals, the person may still be left with arthritis, pain, stiffness, or even deformity. Nonunion/malunion: Sometimes, the fractured bone will not heal completely (called a nonunion) or will heal improperly (called a malunion). Rarely, surgery may be necessary to fix this problem."
What is Fragile X syndrome?,"'Fragile X syndrome (also called Fragile X) is the most common inherited form of mental retardation.* It results from a change, or mutation, in a single gene, which can be passed from one generation to the next. Fragile X appears in families of every ethnic group and income level.'""Symptoms of Fragile X syndrome occur because the mutated gene cannot produce enough of a protein that is needed by the body's cells, especially cells in the brain, to develop and function normally. The amount and usability of this protein, in part, determine how severe the effects of Fragile X are.""'The most noticeable and consistent effect of Fragile X is on intelligence. More than 80 percent of males with Fragile X have an IQ (intelligence quotient) of 75 or less.''1'' The effect of Fragile X on intelligence is more variable in females. Some females have mental impairment, some have ''learning disabilities'', and some have a normal IQ.''People with Fragile X syndrome also share certain medical problems as well as many common physical characteristics,''2'' such as large ears and a long face. In addition, having Fragile X is often associated with problems with sensation, emotion, and behavior.'""The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is a major sponsor of research on Fragile X syndrome. Since 1991, when researchers funded by the NICHD discovered the gene that causes Fragile X, scientists have learned a great deal about that gene's structure and functions. The NICHD continues to support clinicians and scientists around the world who are working to find effective behavioral or other therapies, medical treatments, and prevention strategies for Fragile X.""'* The NICHD recognizes that there is a debate about the use of the term ""mental retardation,"" and that self-advocacy groups and professional associations are currently discussing alternative terms. Until a consensus is reached, and with the goal of addressing health-related issues faced by people with what has been traditionally known as ""mental retardation,"" this article uses that term to describe some features related to Fragile X syndrome. For more information, please see the Additional Resources section of this article.'  "
What causes Fragile X syndrome?,"'The underlying cause of ''Fragile X is a change in a single gene, the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (''FMR1'') gene'', which is found on the X chromosome. (See the Human cells 101 section for more information about the X chromosome.) But how does this change cause Fragile X?''Mental retardation is associated with more than 500 conditions. Some of the most commonly known genetic causes among these are:''Other causes of mental retardation that can occur during ''pregnancy'"" include the mother's excessive use of ""'alcohol'', exposure to poisons in the environment, and diseases such as ''rubella''.'""Genes contain the information used by other parts of a cell to make proteins. Proteins are the body's building blocks. Each protein performs a specific job. They make up the structure of your organs and tissues and are needed for all of your body's chemical functions. ""'Each gene contains information for making at least one protein. If this information is changed, then the cell may not be able to make that protein, or it may not be able to make a form of the protein that the body can use. Fragile X occurs because the ''FMR1'' gene is unable to make normal amounts of usable ''Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, or FMRP''. ''The amount of FMRP in the body is one factor that determines how severe the effects of having Fragile X are. A person with nearly normal levels of FMRP usually has mild or no symptoms, while a person with very little or no normal FMRP has more severe symptoms. ''Scientists are still studying the role of FMRP in the body. One current research study revealed that certain cell processes brain cells use to communicate with one another occur in excess in mice that have little or no FMRP; that is, he brain cells may communicate too much or may communicate inappropriately. Researchers believe that FMRP may regulate the amount of communication between cells and keep it under control. Scientists are hopeful that they can identify a similar function for FMRP in humans. ' Down syndrome, due to an error in the number of chromosomes Fragile X, due to a repeat in the genetic code that leads to a lack of production of a certain protein PKU (phenylketonuria), due to an error in a single gene that makes a defective enzyme"
What keeps the FMR1 gene from producing FMRP in Fragile X syndrome?,"'The information for making a protein has two parts: the introduction, and the instructions for the protein itself. Scientists call the introduction ""the promoter region"" of the gene because of its role in starting the protein-building process. (For a more complete description of how proteins are made and the parts of a cell involved in making a protein, see the Human cells 101 section.) ''The promoter region of the ''FMR1'' gene contains ''repeats'' of a specific sequence (cytosine-guanine-guanine or CGG-see the Human cells 101 section for specific information about the CGG sequence) that, when normal, controls the activity level of the gene in building FMRP.''The number of repeated sequences in the promoter region varies from person to person. Most people who do not have Fragile X have between six and 40 CGG repeats,''3'' with the average being about 30 repeats in the promoter region.''4''However, in a mutated ''FMR1'' gene, the promoter may have hundreds of repeated sequences.''The larger number of repeats (more than 200) inactivates the gene. This inactivation process is called methylation. When the gene is inactivated, the cell may make little or none of the needed FMRP.''What goes wrong in a mutated gene?'""A number of things can go wrong in a gene that can result in a mutation. The mutation affects the gene's ability to make the needed amount of protein or to make enough usable protein. Some of these mutations include:""'In the case of Fragile X, usually the ''FMR1'' gene is present, and its chemical sequence is correct, so neither A nor B apply. However, a mutated ''FMR1'' gene includes repeats of a specific sequence in its promoter region, which creates a mutation like the one shown in situation C.''The number of repeats and their effects are still being studied. At the time this article was printed, the numbers included here were the most commonly cited for premutation in the published scientific literature: Fragile X Syndrome Handbook (2002) National Fragile X Foundation; American College of Medical Genetics Statement: Technical Standards and Guidelines for Fragile X (2001); Rousseau et al. (1996) American Journal of Human Genetics 59(Suppl):A188-1069. However, some research categorizes the premutation differently. For instance, in Crawford et al., 61 to 200 repeats is a premutation, while 41 to 60 repeats is an intermediate mutation (Genetics in Medicine 2001; 3:359-371). The American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' Policy Statement. Health Supervision for Children with Fragile X Syndrome uses 50 to 200 repeats for premutation (Pediatrics 1996; 98(2): 297-300). Tassone et al. (American Journal of Medical Genetics 2000; 97[3]:195-203) use large premutation (100 to 200 repeats) and small premutation (55 to 100 repeats). You may encounter differences in the number of repeats for a premutation depending on your source.''One interesting aspect of Fragile X is that, even with a full mutation gene, the body may be able to make some FMRP. Three things affect how much FMRP is produced:' A gene with 55 to 200 repeats is generally considered a ""premutation."" A gene with more than about 200 repeats is called a ""full mutation."" The number of CGG repeats. People with a full mutation (200 or more repeats) usually have many of the more severe symptoms associated with Fragile X. In contrast, people with a premutation gene may have few, if any, symptoms and may not even know they carry a mutated gene. Researchers are still trying to sort out any, patterns or trends in the symptoms of people with a premutation gene. Being mosaic. Not every cell in the body is exactly the same. In Fragile X, this means that some cells may have 200 or more repeats in the FMR1 promoter, while other cells, premutation cells, may have fewer than 200 repeats. This is called being ""mosaic,"" meaning either that the mutation is in some of the cells, but not all of them, or that it is not in all of the cells to the same degree. The premutation cells may be able to make FMRP. Similarly, methylation may not happen at all, or to the same degree, in every cell. If enough cells produce FMRP, the symptoms of Fragile X will be milder than if none of the cells produce FMRP. Being female. Because females have two X chromosomes, females with Fragile X have one normal FMR1 gene and one mutated FMR1 gene in most of their cells. But, only one X chromosome is active in each cell, and only the genes on the active chromosome are used to build proteins. The cell seems to randomly choose which chromosome is used. In some cells, then, the X chromosome that contains the normal FMR1 gene is active, and the cell uses it to make FMRP. As a result, even females with a full mutation are often able to make some of the needed protein. For this reason, the symptoms of Fragile X usually affect females less often and less seriously than males."
Human cells 101,"'More than 100 trillion cells make up the human body. Most of these cells contain all the genes and other information needed to ""build"" a human being. Much of this genetic information is found in the nucleus of the cell, a ""control center"" that keeps all the material together in one place.''The nucleus stores its genetic material in packages called chromosomes. Most people have 46 chromosomes in each cell-23 from their mother and 23 from their father. After ''fertilization'"", the two sets of chromosomes match up to form 23 pairs. The chromosomes in the 23rd pair are called the sex chromosomes, X and Y; they determine a person's sex. Males usually have one Y chromosome and one X chromosome; females usually have two X chromosomes. """"Each chromosome is made up of genes. Genes contain the information used by other parts of the cell to make proteins, the body's building blocks. Proteins make up the structure of your organs and tissues; they are also needed for your body's chemical functions. Each protein performs a specific job in different types of cells, and the information for making at least one protein is contained in a single gene.""'Genes are made up of various lengths of DNA, which contains four chemicals: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). These chemicals line up like beads on a necklace to form strands of code. They also pair up with each other to form the double strands that are characteristic of DNA.'""The gene's chemical code for a protein has two parts: the introduction area (""'promoter''), and the instructions for creating the protein. The instructions for making the protein are inside the cell\'s nucleus, but the parts that actually make the protein are outside the nucleus. To send the instructions to the protein-producing areas of the cell, the gene ""reads"" the chemical code and rewrites it into a new form (called messenger RNA). The new form is then sent out of the cell\'s nucleus to make proteins. But, if either the original code or the new form of the code is incorrect or has missing parts, the cell can\'t make the correct protein. Without the protein, the body may not develop or function normally.''This is what happens in Fragile X. The ''FMR1'' gene contains too many repeats of one specific sequence, CGG, which is an important part of the promoter region for making FMRP (see the figure below).'""The number of CGG repeats affects how the code is read and rewritten into its new form. So when the new form of the code gets to the protein-making areas of the cell, the cell has trouble using it to make FMRP, the protein that is abnormal, missing, or in low amounts in people with Fragile X. The cell either can't use the code, and so makes no FMRP, or tries to use the code and makes abnormal or unusable FMRP."" "
How many people are affected by Fragile X syndrome?,"""Currently, researchers don't know exactly how many people have either the full mutation or the premutation form of the ""'FMR1'' gene. Even though researchers can estimate the number of people affected by Fragile X, these estimates can be very different.*''The important thing to remember is that, when you consider the individuals affected by full mutation and premutation forms of the ''FMR1'' gene, their families, and their communities, this condition impacts hundreds of thousands of people.''\xa0For more information, please consult the specific articles or the national organizations listed in the Where can I go for more information about Fragile X syndrome? section of this article.' "
How is Fragile X syndrome inherited?,"'The gene for Fragile X is carried on the X chromosome. Because both males (XY) and females (XX) have at least one X chromosome, both can pass on the mutated gene to their children''XY''X''X''Fragile''XY''X''X''Fragile'""A father with the altered gene for Fragile X on his X chromosome will only pass that gene on to his daughters. He passes a Y chromosome on to his sons, which doesn't transmit the condition. Therefore, if the father has the altered gene on his X chromosome, but the mother's X chromosomes are normal, all of the couple's daughters would have the altered gene for Fragile X, while none of their sons would have the mutated gene (see Diagram A). ""'Current research indicates that a father can pass on the premutation form of the ''FMR1'' gene only to his daughters. In other words, if a daughter inherits the mutated ''FMR1'"" gene from her father, she will get only the premutation from him, not the full mutation. Even if the father himself has a full mutation, it appears that sperm can carry only the premutation. Scientists don't understand how or why fathers can only pass on the milder form of Fragile X to their daughters. This remains an area of focused research. ""'Because mothers pass on only X chromosomes to their children, if the mother has the altered gene for Fragile X, she can pass that gene to either her sons or her daughters. If the mother has the mutated gene on one X chromosome and has one normal X chromosome, and the father has no genetic mutations, all the children have a 50-50 chance of inheriting the mutated gene (see Diagram B).''Y''X''Fragile''X''X''Fragile''XY''XX''The odds noted here apply to each child the parents have. Having one child who receives an X chromosome with the ''FMR1'' mutation does not increase or decrease the chances of having another child with the mutated ''FMR1'' gene. Nor do these odds influence the severity of the symptoms. Having one child with mild symptoms does not mean that the other children will have severe symptoms, and having a child with severe symptoms does not mean that other children will have mild symptoms. ''A premutation gene is less stable than a full mutation. In some cases, the mutated gene may expand from the premutation to the full mutation as it is passed on from mother to child. The chances of expansion depend on the number of repeats in the promoter of the premutation gene; the higher the number of repeats, the more likely it is that the gene will expand. These chances also increase with each generation. Children of a mother who has the premutation, then, may have no genetic mutation, the premutation, or the full mutation.''Further, because an altered ''FMR1'' gene can be passed on without symptoms, many people are unaware that they have it. As a result, a premutation form of the ''FMR1'' gene can be silently passed through a family for generations, with no one ever showing any symptoms. However, with each generation, it becomes more likely that the premutation gene will expand its number of repeats to become a full mutation gene, which would also increase the number of and seriousness of symptoms.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of Fragile X syndrome?,"'Not everyone with Fragile X has the same signs and symptoms, or to the same degree. Even affected children in the same family can have different signs and symptoms. These differences often make Fragile X hard to diagnose. However, because everyone with Fragile X has too little FMRP, they do share a pattern of certain physical, social, mental, and sensory characteristics. Although most of the Fragile X research to date has focused on children, adults with Fragile X also have most of these signs and symptoms. ''In general, the signs and symptoms of Fragile X fall into five categories:''Now consider each category in more detail.'   Intelligence and learning Physical Social and emotional Speech and language Sensory Disorders commonly associated or sharing features with Fragile X"
Intelligence and learning,"'Many people with Fragile X have impaired intellectual functioning, which affects their ability to think, reason, and learn. In most cases, researchers use an intelligence test to measure intellectual functioning, resulting in an IQ (intelligence quotient) score. But this score reflects many things besides the ability to think. Attention disorders, ''hyperactivity'', ''anxiety'', and language processing problems can interfere with test-taking skills and learning. Because many people with Fragile X have these problems, a person with Fragile X may have more capabilities than his or her IQ score suggests.''Researchers consider people who score between 85 and 115 on an IQ test to have ""average"" intelligence.''7'' On the whole, less than 20 percent of males with Fragile X have an IQ in this range.''2'' At the same time, few people with Fragile X are severely or profoundly impaired, with IQs below 40 or 25, respectively.''8'' In general, those with a full mutation tend to have an IQ somewhere in between 40 and 85, which is considered mild to moderate mental impairment.''Females tend to be less seriously affected by Fragile X than males. Even among females who have full-mutation ''FMR1'' genes, only about one-third have an IQ in the mental retardation range.''6'' Females with Fragile X are more likely to have relatively normal cognitive development, or they may show a ''learning disability'' where their academic achievement in some areas is lower than their overall ability to learn. For example, a female with a learning disability in math might score several grades below her grade level in math, even though her IQ is within the normal range. ''Many factors influence intelligence, and, like most individuals, people with Fragile X have areas of both strength and ''weakness''. For example, people with Fragile X tend to have good memories for pictures and visual patterns. This ability helps them to learn to recognize letters and words. They are also generally able to follow instructions that are presented as pictures. Their main weaknesses are in thinking about abstract ideas, organizing information, planning ahead, and solving problems. ''No matter what their IQ or areas of intelligence, all children and adults with Fragile X are capable of learning. Most children will progress in school and develop basic academic skills. Many adults can learn to take care of themselves and work at a job. People with Fragile X may need more time to learn, special teaching methods, or a specially tailored environment (see the Suggestions for working with individuals with Fragile X box), but they usually can and do make steady progress.' Know the learning style of the individual. Develop a consistent daily schedule or routine. Use visual signs (pictures, sign language, logos, words) and concrete examples or materials to present ideas, concepts, steps, etc. Prepare the individual for any changes in routine by explaining them ahead of time, possibly using visual signs. Include functional goals with academic goals; for instance, teaching the individual the names of different pieces of clothing as well as how to dress him/herself. Provide opportunities for the child to be active and move around. Use computers and interactive educational software. Provide a quiet place where the child can retreat and regroup."
Physical,"'Many infants and young children with Fragile X have no distinctive physical features. Some children have very soft, velvety skin, a broad forehead, or a slightly larger head than other children their age. ''However, when these children enter ''puberty'', usually around age 11, they may begin to develop certain features that are typical of ''teens'' and adults with Fragile X, such as a longer face or jaw and larger, more noticeable ears. Most do not grow as tall as their peers, or as tall as one might expect them to grow, based on the height of their family members.''Other physical changes also come with puberty for those who have Fragile X. Many males develop enlarged testicles, a condition called macro-orchidism (pronounced mack-roe-ORK-id-izm). With this condition, the testicles may grow to twice their normal size. This condition is not due to hormonal imbalance and does not affect sexual development. ''One job of FMRP may be to help the body maintain its connective tissues. Connective tissues support the body, inside and out. Many people with Fragile X have loose, flexible joints. They may have flat ''feet'' and be able to extend joints like the thumb, knee, and elbow further than normal. Weak connective tissue can predispose a person to certain medical conditions, such as ''hernia'' and frequent middle ''ear infections''. Weak connective tissue can also affect the valves and vessels of the ''heart'', so that blood in the heart may not flow smoothly, which creates a ''heart murmur'' (called ''mitral valve prolapse'', pronounced my-trell valv proh lapss). Although it involves the heart, this condition is usually not life threatening, but it is a good idea for a person with a ''heart murmur'' to be monitored by a health care professional on a regular basis. ''Late in life, some males who have a premutation may develop ''hand tremors''10'' and problems with ''walking''.''Understanding how Fragile X affects the brain and learning what role FMRP plays in normal brain development and function are areas of active research. For instance, some evidence suggests that FMRP is involved in forming pathways in the brain.''Normally, brain cells called neurons have special areas that grow toward each other to form connections. These connections, called ""synapses,"" are arranged in neural pathways. Thoughts, sounds, and memories are recorded and stored in these pathways. However, not every experience recorded in these neural pathways is useful or needs to be kept throughout life. So, as part of normal development, the brain ""prunes"" itself. Like pruning the branches of a tree, removing unneeded or ineffective pathways in the brain strengthens other pathways and makes room for new growth and new learning.'""FMRP may somehow influence the pruning process in the brain. People without enough FMRP may have may have too many neural pathways or many connections that don't work well. This situation would explain some of the symptoms of Fragile X, such as an extreme sensitivity to new sights, sounds, smells, and touches. ""'Using mice and fruit flies that no longer have a working gene to make FMRP, scientists are working to understand how the absence of this protein affects the brain. Recent research is trying to determine whether a certain process that runs out of control in mice with little or no FMRP leads to the behavioral and learning problems typical in people with Fragile X. Such animal studies may reveal exactly how FMRP functions in the brain and suggest ways to correct situations caused by a lack of the protein. ''Fragile X affects females in some different ways. About 16 percent''11'' to 19 percent''12'' of females who have a premutation gene experience ''premature ovarian failure'' (POF), meaning their ovarian function stops before normal ''menopause'"", sometimes well before the age of 40. Some may experience POF as early as their mid-twenties. POF affects a woman's ability to get ""'pregnant''. It is important, then, for women to know whether or not they have a premutation gene, and to have this knowledge early enough, so that they can consider their options for having a family. In contrast, POF occurs in only 1 percent of women who have two normal ''FMR1'' genes,''13'' and the average age of ''menopause'' for women who are not affected by Fragile X is 51. Women who have a full mutation gene do not lose ovarian function as early as women with a premutation gene, but they still tend to begin ''menopause'' earlier than women who are not affected by Fragile X. Scientists do not know why the effect is milder in women who have a full mutation form of the gene than in women with a premutation form of the gene.' "
Social and emotional,"'Most children with Fragile X-especially boys-feel a great deal of social ''anxiety'""; that is, they aren't completely comfortable in new situations, meeting new people, or doing new things. Their level of anxiety can be so high that they may avoid social situations. When these children do seek contact with others, they are often extremely nervous or uncomfortable. Their anxiety may show up as a lack of eye contact and/or fast, choppy speech. Although all children feel some degree of social anxiety, this discomfort usually doesn't keep them from being social, as it may for children with Fragile X. ""'In addition to being anxious, males with Fragile X tend to be easily upset. They are easily overwhelmed with sights and sounds (see the What are the signs and symptoms of Fragile X?-Sensory section of this article for more information), and can become very distressed in a busy store or restaurant. Unexpected changes in routine, like entering a new class or classroom, can also upset them. Some children respond by becoming extremely rigid or tense, while others whine or cry. At times, their reactions can spill over into tantrums or repetitive actions, such as rocking back and forth and biting themselves. In adolescence, changes, such as rising hormone levels, may make these outbursts more extreme. In one study of teenage males with Fragile X, about one-third showed angry, aggressive behavior.''8'' Such behavior can get them into trouble at school. Providing medication and a calm environment can help keep such behaviors from getting worse. (See the Are there treatments for Fragile X? section for more information.) ''In addition, males with Fragile X tend to experience much longer periods of anxiety than their peers. Like other males, their heart rate and other signs of nervousness increase when they do challenging tasks, but many males with Fragile X stay highly anxious for much longer time frame. So, in addition to having a level of anxiety that is often higher than their peers, males with Fragile X also take longer to calm down than other males do. '""Females with Fragile X may have social problems, too, but theirs tend to be milder. A female with Fragile X may feel uneasy around strangers or have trouble making friends, but these females don't tend to be aggressive as adolescents."" "
Speech and language,"'Language difficulties in children who have Fragile X range from mild ''stuttering'' to more severe problems with basic language skills. Basic language skills include the ability to pronounce words clearly, to speak and write using words and grammar correctly, and to communicate in meaningful ways. ''Females with Fragile X rarely have severe problems with speech or language. In fact, many have vocabulary and grammar skills that are appropriate for their age, which can help them learn to read and write. However, their social anxiety and shyness may get in the way of communication. Some females with Fragile X speak in a rambling, disorganized way or often get off the subject. Most males with Fragile X have more serious problems expressing themselves. These difficulties typically include problems speaking clearly and other problems with language that can be moderate to severe. In terms of speech, males with Fragile X often have problems coordinating the structures, vocal processes (such as pitch, loudness, and tone), and movements needed for clear speech. They often have difficulty receiving and processing spoken information, such as following spoken directions, storing words and concepts for future use, and creating their own meaningful responses to questions or comments. ''Males with Fragile X may ''stutter'' or leave sounds out of their words. Many repeat themselves, restart the same sentence many times, or ask the same question again and again. Some may talk too fast, mumble, or speak in a loud, high voice. Some of these difficulties may be due to sensory overload or social anxiety, rather than a problem with the parts of the brain that control speech and language.''Perhaps most importantly, males with Fragile X usually have difficulty using speech and language in social contexts. They often seem unaware of conversational ""clues,"" such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language. As a result, they may speak out of turn, fail to answer a question, or turn away because they aren\'t sure what to do. Unlike males with other developmental disorders, like ''autism'', males with Fragile X seem to be very interested in communicating, but may experience sensory overload or social overload when they try to hold a conversation.''For some children, language problems are more severe. Many children with Fragile X begin talking later than expected. Most begin using words around age four, but some may not talk until age of six or eight.''6'' Most talk eventually, but some may remain nonverbal throughout life. For these nonverbal children, a wide variety of picture-based and computer-based devices may help them to communicate, which could also reduce behavior difficulties that result from not being able to talk. Pictures, sign language, and generic gestures can also be helpful for all children with Fragile X, before they start talking.' "
Sensory,"'Many children with Fragile X are sensitive to certain sensations.''Autism.'' Most males and about one-third of females with Fragile X show some autism-like behaviors, such as flapping hands, biting themselves, repetitious actions, and walking on toes.''14'' About 33% of children with Fragile X show enough of these behaviors to receive a formal diagnosis of autism.''15'' However, among people diagnosed with autism first, only about 4 percent are found to have an X chromosome with the ''FMR1'' gene mutation.''Attention Deficit Disorder'' (''ADD'')/''Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder'' (''ADHD'').'' Between 80 and 90 percent of males, and 35 to 47 percent of females with Fragile X have an attention disorder.''16,17'' They are unable to focus their attention and stay with a task. They may be disorganized. Some are hyperactive and seem to be constantly in motion.''Connective Tissue Problems.'' Due to weak connective tissue, people with Fragile X have a higher risk of dislocating their joints and developing hernias and ''ear infections'"" than those who aren't affected by Fragile X. About half of adults with Fragile X have a heart murmur caused by ""'mitral valve'' prolapse,''17'' which is usually not life threatening.''Seizures''.'' About 20%''6'' of children with Fragile X also experience seizures. In most cases, seizures are successfully treated with medication and disappear by adolescence.''Premature Ovarian Failure (POF).'"" POF occurs when a woman's ovaries stop working properly and she is under the age of 40. As mentioned earlier in this article, about 16 to 19 percent of females who carry a premutation gene for Fragile X experience POF, some as early as age 20.""'10,11'' Women with a full mutation gene for Fragile X are less likely to have POF, but do tend to go through menopause earlier than women who do not carry a mutated gene.'""They may become frantic at the sound of a loud noise or may be easily distracted by slight sounds in the room. They may be bothered by the texture of their clothes against their skin, or they may be unable to focus on the parts of their environment that are important, such as the sound of the teacher's voice. Infants with Fragile X may have problems drinking from a bottle, perhaps because the feel of the ""'nipple'' upsets them. Some children try to avoid being touched, and even a brief tickle or hug may be overwhelming. Even though many of these symptoms are often life-long, most people affected by Fragile X, with the proper intervention, can find ways to handle or avoid the discomfort. (See the Are there treatments for Fragile X syndrome? section for more information.)''Children with Fragile X may also have problems with balance. A sense of balance helps keep the body upright and stable. Problems with balance, coordination, and connective tissue can cause difficulties for children with Fragile X as they learn to sit, stand, and walk, or later, to ride a bike. Even so, most children with Fragile X learn to do these tasks.' "
Is there a cure for Fragile X syndrome?,"'Although research continues and knowledge about Fragile X and its characteristics grows, there is no cure for Fragile X at this time.' "
Are there treatments for Fragile X syndrome?,"'Currently there is no definitive, single treatment for Fragile X. However, there are a variety of ways to help minimize the symptoms of the condition. Children with Fragile X who receive appropriate education, behavioral or physical therapy, and medication have the best chance of using their individual capabilities and skills. Even those with significant mental retardation can learn to master many self-help skills. '""One important factor in developing a child's long-term potential is early intervention. The sooner a child begins to get help, the more opportunity for learning. Because a young child's brain is still forming, early intervention gives children the best start possible and the best chance of developing their full potential. Even so, no matter when a person is diagnosed with Fragile X, it's never too late to benefit from treatment. ""'Some treatment options include:' Educational options Therapeutic options Medication options"
Educational Options,"'Most children with Fragile X, including those with severe mental retardation, are guaranteed free, appropriate public education under federal law. Public Law 105-17: The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act-IDEA (1997) makes it possible for children with disabilities to get free educational services and educational devices to help them learn as much as they can. Each child is entitled to these services from age three through high school, or until age 21, whichever comes first. Also, every state operates an early intervention program for children from birth to age three; children with Fragile X should qualify for these services. The law also states that children must be taught in the least restrictive environment, appropriate for that individual child. This statement does not mean that each child will be placed in a regular classroom, but instead, that the best combination of one-to-one tutoring, small group work, and regular classroom work will be arranged.''Because not all children or adolescents with Fragile X have mental impairment or special needs, a medical diagnosis of Fragile X does not guarantee access to special education services. The child must have certain cognitive or learning deficits. Parents can contact a local school principal or special education coordinator to learn how to have their child examined to see if he or she qualifies for services under the IDEA.'""If a child qualifies for special services, a team of people, including the child's parents or caregivers, teachers, school psychologist, and other child development specialists, will work together to design an ""'Individualized Education Plan (IEP)'' for the child. The IEP includes specific learning goals for that child, based on his or her needs and capabilities. The team also decides how best to carry out the IEP, such as making choices about classroom placement for the child, determining any devices or special assistance the child needs, and identifying the developmental specialists who will work with the child.''A child with Fragile X should be evaluated and re-evaluated on a regular basis by his or her special services team. In this way, the team can determine how the child is doing and whether any changes are needed in his or her treatment (for instance, changes to the IEP, changes in classroom placement, or changes in other services) to ensure the child is getting the best possible care.''In general, there are three classroom placement options for a child with Fragile X, based on his or her specific abilities and needs:'""Placement decisions should be based on each child's needs and abilities. In most cases, these decisions require a balance of various priorities to maximize the chances for the best possible outcome for the child."" Full inclusion in a regular classroom. The child spends the full day in the regular classroom rather than just among children with special needs. This situation is sometimes called ""mainstreaming."" Specialists work with the child in the classroom, with other students present. There may be an aide assigned to help the child with certain kinds of tasks. Inclusion with ""pull-out"" services. In this type of placement, the child spends most of the day in the regular classroom. However, for part of the day, he or she attends small-group classes with one or more developmental specialists, such as a speech-language therapist or a physical therapist. This arrangement gives the child exposure to children who do not have special needs, as well as more individual attention to his or her areas of special needs Full-time, special education classroom. Some children with Fragile X may do better in a smaller special education class than in a regular classroom. Special education classrooms usually have fewer children and offer more individualized attention from the teacher. Such programs may be offered at the school or in central locations that serve a larger area. Regional special education centers often have facilities and equipment designed for children with special needs. For some children, a special school for children with similar disabilities may be the best option."
Therapeutic Options,"'A variety of professionals can help individuals with Fragile X and their families deal with symptoms of the disorder. Such assistance is usually most effective when provided by health care professionals experienced with Fragile X.'""The services of these specialists may be available to pre-school and school-aged children, as well as to teens, through the local public school system. In a school setting, several specialists often work together to assess each child's particular strengths and weaknesses, and to plan a program that is specially tailored to meet the child's needs. These services are often free. More intense and individualized help is available through private clinics, but the family usually has to pay for private services, although some health insurance plans may help cover the cost."" Speech-language therapists can help people with Fragile X to improve their pronunciation of words and sentences, slow down speech, and use language more effectively. They may set up social or problem-solving situations to help a child practice using language in meaningful ways. For the minority of children who fail to develop functional speech, this type of specialist may work with other specialists to design and teach nonverbal ways of communication. For example, some children may prefer to use small picture cards arranged on a key ring to express themselves; or they may learn to use a hand-held computer that is programmed to ""say"" words and phrases when a single key is pressed. Occupational therapists help find ways to adjust tasks and conditions to match a person's needs and abilities. For example, this type of therapist might teach parents to swaddle or massage their baby who has Fragile X to calm him or her. Or the therapist might find a specially designed computer mouse and keyboard or a pencil that is easier for a child with poor motor control to grip. At the high school level, an occupational therapist can help a teenager with Fragile X identify a job, career, or skill that matches his or her interests and individual capabilities.17 Physical therapists design activities and exercises to build motor control and to improve posture and balance. They can teach parents ways to exercise their baby's muscles. At school, a physical therapist may help a child who is easily over-stimulated or who avoids body contact to participate in sports and games with other children. Behavioral therapists try to identify why a child acts in negative ways and then seek ways to prevent these distressing situations, and to teach the child to cope with the distress. This type of specialist also works with parents and teachers to find useful responses to desirable and undesirable behavior. During puberty, rising and changing hormone levels can cause adolescents to become more aggressive. A behavioral therapist can help a teenager recognize his or her intense emotions and teach healthy ways to calm down."
Medication Options,"'Currently, there is no medication that can cure Fragile X. Further, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any ''drugs'' specifically for the treatment of Fragile X or its causes. But, in many cases, medications''18'' have been used to treat many of the symptoms associated with Fragile X, as shown in the table on the next page. Please note that the NICHD does not endorse or support the use of any of these medications in treating symptoms of Fragile X syndrome, or for other conditions for which the medications are not FDA approved. ''Medication is most effective when paired with therapy designed to teach new coping skills or behavior. Not every medication helps every child with behavioral symptoms related to Fragile X. Doctors usually prescribe these kinds of medications on a trial basis, to see if they help.

What are the options for adults who have Fragile X syndrome?,"""IDEA requires transition plans for moving from one phase of life to another, and the move from teenager to young adult to adult is no exception. The special services team, which can include family, teachers, a school psychologist, and other developmental specialists, makes the transition plan based on the individual's needs, interests, and skills. These plans may include vocational assessment and training, additional education, supported employment, and community participation. IDEA requires that the plan be in place by the time the individual is 16 years old. The plan will also consider the individual's level of independence to determine what type of living arrangements he or she might benefit from in the future.""'As the teenager with Fragile X gets closer to finishing high school, or to his or her 21st birthday, the structure of his or her day may change to include work/study programs, job-related behavior training, and independent living classes.

What should I do if I find out someone in my family has Fragile X syndrome?,"'If someone in your family, a child or an adult, is diagnosed with Fragile X, you may also want to be tested to see if you have a mutated ''FMR1'' gene. It is now possible to test for Fragile X in people of any age, as well as before birth. These tests are simple and accurate. ''At present, testing for Fragile X is not done routinely. The tests are often done to help diagnose a child who is developmentally delayed or shows signs of autism or mental retardation.''19'' Couples who have one or more relatives with mental retardation of unknown cause may also want to be evaluated before deciding to have a child. ''Health care professionals may also recommend an evaluation for Fragile X in a person with one of the following traits:''20''A number of tests are used to diagnose Fragile X. Each test has its limitations, so in many cases more than one test may be used. The most accurate tests are DNA tests.''A pregnant woman who has characteristics that place her at risk for Fragile X, such as features of Fragile X or a family history that suggests the presence of Fragile X, may want to have a ''prenatal'' test. During such a test, the doctor either takes a sample of ''amniotic fluid'', a process called ''amniocentesis'', or takes a sample of cells from the placenta, a process called ''chorionic villus sampling''. Then the cells are sent to a lab, where they go through one of the methods used to diagnose Fragile X. Cells that contain a larger number of CGG repeats would be diagnosed as having Fragile X.''These tests can be done on many different types of body tissues. In most cases, a simple blood test provides the cells needed. But cells from hair roots and from inside the cheek can also be used. If you or one of your family members wants to be tested, talk to your health care provider. He or she will likely take a sample of your blood and send it to a lab. The results will come back in a number of weeks. For more information on tests for Fragile X and their features, please refer to the Additional Resources section.' Any person who has mental retardation of unknown cause, developmental delay, or learning disability Any person with autism or showing autism-like behaviors Any person with a relative who has Fragile X or mental retardation of unknown cause Anyone who was previously assessed for Fragile X using the chromosome test (see description on the next page) Women with premature ovarian failure (POF) or with a family history of POF DNA molecular tests count the number of CGG repeats in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene and check to see if the gene is methylated (inactive). These tests are used most often to diagnose Fragile X. The two main DNA tests include: Southern Blot studies how quickly DNA pieces move through a liquid or gel when exposed to electricity. Although good at finding large numbers of repeats and determining methylation, this process is rather slow. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) multiplies the amount of DNA being tested so it can be analyzed more quickly. Although it can miss some large repeat mutations, this test is much faster to perform and is very good at detecting small and medium-sized repeat segments. Chromosome test looks for the ""broken"" area of a chromosome using a microscope. Because this test is older, costly, and often inaccurate, it is recommended that another type of test be used to diagnose Fragile X. The DNA test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Protein test measures the amount of FMRP produced by living cells. This test is useful for screening large groups of people for Fragile X. In the future, this test may be helpful in evaluating how severe an FMR1 mutation is. The DNA test is needed to confirm the diagnosis."
What is being done to develop treatments or a cure for Fragile X syndrome?,"'Since the late 1960s, the NICHD has supported the research of scientists who are trying to understand Fragile X. The work of these scientists continues to increase knowledge about this disorder, but many questions still remain unanswered. ''In 1991, researchers funded by the NICHD identified ''FMR1'' as the gene that, when mutated, causes Fragile X. Since that time, the NICHD has been a major source of funds for Fragile X research. In addition, a number of private, non-profit organizations, including the FRAXA Research Foundation, the National Fragile X Foundation, and the Conquer Fragile X Foundation, are also dedicated to continuing Fragile X research and to raising awareness of the disorder. ''In the '""Children's Health""' Act of 2000, congress authorized the NICHD to create and maintain at least three research centers specifically for Fragile X research. In March 2003, the NICHD announced awards for the following Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers to house the new Fragile X Research Centers: the University of North Carolina, in affiliation with the University of Kansas; the University of Washington; and Baylor College of Medicine. The efforts of these new centers began in late spring 2003.''Also in 2000, the NICHD initiated, with financial collaboration from the FRAXA Research Foundation and the National Institute of ''Mental Health'', a special research program to support noted scientists around the world in an effort to find treatments and a cure for Fragile X. ''Some of these researchers are examining Fragile X at the molecular level. Some of the questions they are asking include:''The findings from such research may help to prevent or reverse mental retardation and other symptoms of Fragile X.''To advance the field of Fragile X research, scientists are also working to create models of how the human brain works. Some are creating computer programs that imitate the way the human brain learns and remembers. Other scientists modify genes in other animals, such as mice and fruit flies, to try new interventions or treatments. For instance, researchers can replace the ''FMR1'' gene in a normal mouse with a mutated human ''FMR1'' gene. Such ""transgenic"" animals are key to much of the current research. For example, one recent study is examining the effects of a certain substance in transgenic mice that don\'t produce FMRP. Researchers believe that this compound could help regulate brain processes that are impacted by a lack of FMRP. Using these mice, researchers can test this new intervention to ensure that it is safe and effective before the intervention is used with humans. ''Can we prevent or cure Fragile X? Two decades ago, researchers might have said ""No."" Now scientists are exploring several promising possibilities, including:''While these research avenues are promising, none of them has progressed enough to provide immediate help to someone with Fragile X. Parents, families, and caregivers should work together with health care professionals, educators, and therapists to ensure that those affected by Fragile X receive the care that they need. ''This is an exciting time in Fragile X research. Dr. James Watson, who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the co-discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA, believes that science will be able to defeat the negative effects of Fragile X. He predicts, ""Our wealth of research strategies and technologies may soon lead to new forms of therapy and medication. Someday we may be able to prevent the mental retardation and other symptoms of Fragile X.""' Why does the FMR1 gene have an increased number of CGG repeats in the promoter region? What causes the increased methylation of the promoter region, which blocks the gene from producing FMRP? What is the role of FMRP in the brain? How does FMRP help other proteins, and what are the functions of those proteins? Gene repair, gene reactivation, and gene therapy. Scientists may be able to induce certain brain chemicals to repair defective FMR1 genes. Researchers also seek ways to prevent or reverse methylation, the process that interferes with the instructions for making FMRP and inactivates the FMR1 gene. Still other scientists are trying to determine if it is possible to replace defective genes with stable, working copies of the FMR1 gene. This type of gene research involves a number of challenges. First, it is important that researchers learn how many cells are needed to produce the right amount of protein. Too much of the protein may be as harmful as too little, so finding the right balance is crucial. Another difficulty lies in targeting only the defective FMR1 genes for repair or reactivation, without affecting other healthy genes. Further, replacing genes, especially those involved in brain function, carries additional problems and risks. However, researchers continue to pursue these avenues. NICHD-supported and other sponsored research is already underway to study the possibility of reversing methylation on the FMR1 promoter sequence, prenatally. Success in this area may allow scientists to ""reactivate"" FMRP production before a child is born. Other gene research is also underway Protein replacement. Scientists already make FMRP in the lab. At present, however, they are unable to get FMRP to the brain, partly because the FMRP molecule is too large to pass through the structures that protect the brain. Someday people with Fragile X may be able to take a pill or injection of FMRP to relieve many of the symptoms of Fragile X. Protein substitute through medication. Scientists may be able to use other substances to take the place of FMRP in certain brain processes. Using these substitutes, brain processes and other functions of FMRP may be able to occur normally. For example, new drugs may be able to regulate processes in the brain, like communication between neurons, that seem to be affected by low levels of FMRP."

What are freckles?,"'Freckles are flat, beige, brown circular spots that typically are the size of the head of a metal nail. The spots are multiple and may develop on sun-exposed skin after repeated exposure to sunlight. These are particularly common in people with red hair and a fair complexion. They may appear on children as young as 1 or 2 years of age.''Most freckles are generally uniform in color but can vary somewhat in ''color -- they'' may be reddish, yellow, tan, light brown, brown, or ''black -- but'' they are basically slightly darker than the surrounding skin. They may become darker and more apparent after sun exposure and lighten in the winter months. Freckles are due to an increase in the amount of dark pigment called ''melanin'' and an increase in the total number of pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. The word ''freckle'' comes from the Middle English ''freken'', which, in turn, came from the Old Norse ''freknur'', meaning ""freckled."" (Some speakers of Old English and Old Norse must have had a tendency to develop freckles.)' "
What types of freckles are there? Freckles vs. lentigines,"'Ephelides'' (singular: ephelis) is the Greek word and medical term for freckle. This term refers to 1 mm-2 mm flat spots that are tan, slightly reddish, or light brown and typically appear during the sunny months. They are most often found on people with light complexions, and in some families, they are a hereditary (genetic) trait. People with reddish hair and green eyes are more prone to these types of freckles. Sun avoidance and ''sun protection'', including the regular use of ''sunscreen'', help to suppress the appearance of the freckles.''Lentigines'' (singular: ''lentigo'') comes from the Latin word for lentil and is the medical term for certain types of larger pigmented spots most commonly present at the site of previous ''sunburn'' and sun damage. Lentigines are often darker than the common freckle and do not usually fade in the winter. This kind of spot is referred to as lentigo simplex or ''solar lentigo''. The number of melanocytes and melanosomes (cellular structures that contain melanin pigment) are normal in number and appearance. Although occasionally lentigines are part of a certain rare genetic syndromes, for the most part they are just isolated and unimportant spots.' "
"What are ""liver spots"" or ""age spots""?","'""''Liver'' spots"" or ""age spots"" are common names for solar lentigines on the back of the hands. The term ""''liver spot''"" is actually a misnomer since these spots are not caused by liver problems or ''liver disease''. While lentigines do tend to appear over time, they are not in themselves a sign of old age but a sign of sun exposure.' "
Freckles vs. moles,"'Moles'' are small, almost sightless mammals (a shrew relative) that tunnel beneath the ground and occasionally damage suburban lawns and golf courses. This term when used to describe something on the skin is very nonspecific. Most of the time it refers to a brown to black flat to slightly elevated bump. The type of cells of which the bump is composed distinguish the real nature of mole. For example, a mole composed of benign melanocytes is called a melanocytic ''nevus''.''Frequently, elderly people may have raised, brown, crusty lesions called seborrheic keratoses in or around the same areas where lentigines are plentiful. Seborrheic keratoses are also benign (not malignant) growths of the skin. Some patients call these growths ""barnacles"" or ""Rice Krispies."" Although they are most often medium brown, they can differ in color ranging anywhere from light tan to black. They occur in different sizes, too, ranging anywhere from a fraction of an inch (or centimeter) to an inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. Typically, these growths are around the size of a pencil eraser or slightly larger. Some lesions begin as a flat, brown spot, indistinguishable from a lentigo. Then they gradually thicken, forming the waxy stuck-on appearance of seborrheic keratoses. They look like they have either been pasted on the skin or may look like a dab of melted brown candle wax that dropped on the skin. Seborrheic keratoses may occur in the same areas as freckles. Seborrheic keratoses are also more common in areas of sun exposure, but they may also occur in sun-protected areas. When they first appear, the growths usually begin one at a time as small rough ''bumps''. Eventually, they may thicken and develop a rough, warty surface.''Seborrheic keratoses are quite common especially after age 40. Almost everybody may eventually develop at least a few seborrheic keratoses during their lifetime. They are sometimes referred to as the ""barnacles of old age.""' "
What causes freckles?,"'Freckles are thought to develop as a result of a combination of genetic predisposition (inheritance) and sun exposure. The sun and fluorescent tanning lights both emit ultraviolet (UV) rays, which when absorbed by the skin enhances the production of melanin pigment by cutaneous melanocytes. People with blond or red hair, light-colored eyes, and fair skin are especially susceptible to the damaging effect of UV rays and likely to develop freckles. A freckle is essentially nothing more than an unusually heavy deposit of melanin at one spot in the skin.' "
Is it possible to inherit freckles?,"'Heredity or more accurately skin color is a very important factor in the susceptibility to form freckles. The tendency to freckles is ''inherited'' by individuals with fair skin and/or with blond or red hair. Very darkly pigmented individuals are unlikely to develop freckles.''Research in twin siblings, including pairs of identical twins and pairs of fraternal (nonidentical) twins, have found a striking similarity in the total number of freckles found on each pair of identical twins. Such similarities were considerably less common in fraternal twins. These studies strongly suggest that the occurrence of freckles is influenced by genetic factors. A number of genes have been associated with freckling: MC1R, IRF4. ASIP, TYR, and BNC2.'  "
Why do freckles form on body areas not exposed to the sun?,"'True freckles almost never occur on covered skin and pose essentially no health risk at all. They are all absolutely harmless. They are not cancerous and generally do not become cancerous. A rare skin finding called axillary freckling (freckles in the armpit) is occasionally seen in a rare ''inherited disease'' called ''neurofibromatosis''. These freckles are quite different in appearance from the common variety in both their appearance and distribution.''Anyone who has one or more uncertain pigmented spots should have their dermatologist evaluate them. Even verbal descriptions and photographs cannot convey enough information for satisfactory self-diagnosis. As always, it is better to be safe than sorry.''The American Academy of Dermatology recommends a full-body skin examination for adults as part of a routine annual health exam. It is important to have any new, changing, bleeding mole or growth examined by your physician or dermatologist as soon as possible. ''Skin cancers'' are curable if diagnosed and treated at an early stage.' Hutchinson's freckle is a special type of skin cancer called a lentigo maligna melanoma. This is an uncommon superficial skin cancer that generally occurs on the faces of older adults who have a history of considerable sun exposure. Over the course of months to years, this condition may, if untreated, develop into a more aggressive malignant melanoma. A simple in-office test called a skin biopsy can help diagnose lentigo maligna. Melanoma: This very dangerous form of skin cancer may appear even in young people and on parts of the body that are sun-exposed, as well as those that are protected. While the exact cause of melanoma is not entirely known, ultraviolet rays are known to play a part. Melanomas can arise from a previously normal mole (melanocytic nevus) or pigmented spot that has been present many years or lifelong. Melanomas can also arise from completely normal skin without an apparent preexisting mole. In comparison with benign (noncancerous) freckles, melanomas tend to be larger, darker, and have more irregular color and shape variations. Most melanomas are actually flat and not raised as many people tend to incorrectly assume."
What is the treatment for freckles?,"""Freckles are rarely treated. Several safe but expensive methods are available to help lighten or reduce the appearance of freckles. Frequently, multiple or a combination of treatments may be required for best results. Not everyone's skin will improve with similar treatments, and freckles can often recur with repeated UV exposures.""   Bleaching or fading creams: Products containing hydroquinone and kojic acid can be purchased with and without a prescription. Higher concentrations of hydroquinone (over 2%) require a prescription. These products can help lighten freckles if they are applied consistently over a period of months. Bleaching or fading creams are most effective in combination with sun avoidance and sun protection. Retinoids: Sometimes used in conjunction with other bleaching creams, tretinoin (vitamin A acid, Retin-A), tazarotene (Tazorac), and adapalene (Differin) also may help lighten freckles when applied consistently over a period of several months. Cryosurgery: A light freeze with liquid nitrogen in the physician's office can be used to treat some types of freckles. Not all spots respond to this form of therapy. Laser treatment: Multiple types of lasers may help lighten and decrease the appearance of freckles safely and effectively. Like cryosurgery, this is a simple and safe procedure with a high success rate and a low risk of scarring or skin discoloration. Photofacials or Intense Pulsed Light treatments are another method to lighten and remove freckles. This is not a true laser technique but an intense light source. Chemical peels can also help lighten freckles and improve irregular pigmentation."
Are there home remedies for freckles?,"'There are no home remedies that adequately treat freckles. A quick Internet search will reveal a whole host of treatments, most of which are composed of a variety of edible goodies. ''Makeup'' can be of great benefit in concealing freckles.' "
What is the value of freckles?,"'Some people like their freckles, while others may be more bothered by their appearance. The cosmetic improvement of the skin is a frequent request among people with freckles. On the other hand, freckles are desirable by some people who like the special character or uniqueness these give them.''Freckles can have their value. One is in poetry. For example, without freckles, Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894), the American physician, professor, and man of letters, could not have written:''His home! the Western giant smiles,''And twirls the spotty globe to find it;'""This little speck, the British Isles? 'Tis but a freckle, never mind it.""  "
Is it possible to prevent freckles?,"'Since we cannot change our own genetic component of freckling, our main ''prevention'' measures are aimed at sun avoidance and sun-protection, including''Freckle prevention is more effective than freckle removal. Freckle-reduction treatments are more difficult and often not satisfactory. People with known hereditary tendencies of freckling should start sun protection early in childhood. Much of the sun and UV skin damage occurs often while children are under age 18.''Fair-skinned people who are more prone to freckling and sunburns are also generally more at risk for developing skin ''cancers''. Freckles may be a warning sign of sensitive skin that is highly vulnerable to ''sunburn'' and to potential skin ''cancer''.'   use of sunscreens with SPF (sun protection factor) 50, use of wide-brimmed hats (6 inches), use of sun-protective clothing (shirts, long sleeves, long pants), avoidance of the peak sun hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., seeking shade and staying indoors."
What is cryotherapy and how does it work?,"'Cryotherapy is a ''pain'' treatment that uses a method of localized freezing temperatures to deaden an irritated nerve. Cryotherapy is also used as a method of treating localized areas of some ''cancers'' (called cryosurgery), such as ''prostate cancer'' and to treat abnormal skin cells by dermatologists. In this article we only discuss its use in nerve conditions.''In cryotherapy, a probe is inserted into the tissue next to the affected nerve. The temperature of the probe drops to then effectively freeze the nerve. The freezing inactivates the nerve and, as a result, painful nerve irritation is relieved. Cryotherapy is a relatively safe and effective means of treating localized nerve irritation. '  "
What conditions can be treated with cryotherapy?,"'Cryotherapy can be used to treat conditions that involve irritation of an isolated nerve. In general, such conditions include benign nerve growths (''neuromas'') and pinched nerves (nerve entrapments). Specific examples include nerve irritation between the ribs (intercostal neuralgia), cluneal ''nerve entrapment'', ilioinguinal neuroma, hypogastric neuromas, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment, and interdigital neuromas. Many forms of nerve entrapment can often be treated with cryotherapy.'  "
What are the side effects of cryotherapy?,"'While cryotherapy can reduce unwanted nerve irritation, it sometimes can leave the tissue affected with unusual sensations, such as numbness or tingling, or with redness and irritation of the skin. These effects are generally temporary.'  "
Where is cryotherapy performed?,"""Cryotherapy procedures are usually performed in the doctor's office."" "
What Is the Medical Treatment for Frequent Urination?,"'The treatment for frequent urination depends upon underlying cause.' Urinary tract infection: The doctor will prescribe antibiotics. Drinking plenty of fluids is recommended. Diabetes: When blood sugar levels get very high, frequent urination is often one of the first symptoms. Treatment for frequent urination in diabetics involves close management of blood sugar levels. Diuretic use: Ask your doctor if you can take your diuretics in the morning, or less frequently. This may cause less trips to the bathroom at night (nocturia). Prostate problems: Problems with the prostate are usually treated by a specialist called a urologist. There are two common drug types prescribed for enlarged prostate: 5ARIs (5-alpha-reductase inhibitors), which reduce the level of the hormone that causes the prostate to grow, and alpha blockers, which relax the smooth muscle cells, including the bladder. Surgery may also be considered to treat prostate problems. Pregnancy: Frequent urination often accompanies pregnancy. There may not be much that can be done to reduce frequent urination, especially later in the pregnancy. Reduce consumption of diuretic fluids that contain caffeine, such as tea, soda or coffee, however, do not reduce overall fluid intake, as it is important to stay hydrated while pregnant. Consume most fluids during the day to reduce nighttime trips to the bathroom. When using the bathroom, it may help to lean forward slightly to help completely empty out the bladder. Interstitial cystitis: This condition usually requires treatment by a urologist who specializes in interstitial cystitis. It may be treated with medications, including drug pentosan polysulfate sodium (Elmiron), tricyclic antidepressants, pain medications or antihistamines. Surgical treatment may be necessary. Stroke or other neurological diseases: Depending upon the cause, the urinary frequency may be treated with medication, self catheterization, or behavioral therapy, such as bladder retraining (see below). Bladder cancer: Treatment for bladder cancer should be directed by a urologist. It may involve surgery,  chemotherapy and radiation. Overactive bladder syndrome: The first-line treatment for overactive bladder syndrome usually involves bladder retraining (see below). Treatment also may include drugs such as tolterodine (Detrol LA), oral oxybutynin (Ditropan), darifenacin (Enablex), transdermal oxybutynin (Oxytrol), trospium (Sanctura XR),  solifenacin (VESIcare), mirabegron (Myrbetriq), or onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox). Treatments that involve nerve stimulation include percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) and sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). Artificial sweeteners, alcohol, caffeine and other foods: Avoid foods and beverages that irritate your bladder or act as a diuretic."
What Is the Follow-up for Frequent Urination?,"'Continued problems with frequent urination should be evaluated by your doctor and possibly a urologist. If medications are recommended, follow instructions given to you by your doctor. Report any problems or side effects from the medication to your doctor. If you are advised to do bladder retraining or modify your diet or other behavioral changes, follow all instructions from your doctor.' "
How Do You Prevent Frequent Urination?,"'Because there are so many different causes for frequent urination, there is no one way to prevent it. Proper diet and avoiding excess fluids and foods that act as diuretics can reduce urinary frequency. Kegel exercises can keep the pelvic floor muscles well toned and may help stave off urinary frequency as one ages. Discussing any concerning symptoms with your doctor as soon as they appear may allow for early treatment or may prevent worsening of symptoms.' "
What Is the Prognosis for Frequent Urination?,'Many of the causes of frequent urination are temporary and treatable. Treating the cause will reduce or eliminate the symptom of frequent urination.'

What is Friedreich's ataxia syndrome?,"  Friedreich's ataxia syndrome (also termed spinocerebellar degeneration) is a rare genetic disease that causes problems with the nervous system, leading to impaired movement.  Ataxia is a medical term that refers to abnormal muscle coordination. The condition causes unsteady movements and typically worsens over time. Some people with the condition also have problems with the heart or develop diabetes. Intellectual function is not affected."
What are the symptoms and signs of Friedreich's ataxia syndrome?,"""Symptoms and signs of Friedreich's ataxia syndrome usually start when the person is between 5 and 15 years of age, although some people might not develop symptoms until adulthood.\xa0""""Early symptoms of Friedreich's ataxia syndrome include:""""With time, symptoms of Friedreich's ataxia syndrome syndrome spread to involve other muscles, often causing muscle ""'spasticity'' and curvature of the spine (''scoliosis'').\xa0'""Other associated symptoms of Friedreich's ataxia syndrome syndrome can include:""'The rate at which the symptoms progress or worsen over time varies among affected people.'  Balance problems Gait disturbances (difficulty walking) Problems speaking Difficulty swallowing Loss of normal reflexes Loss of sensation in the arms and legs Vision changes Related to heart problems such as palpitations and heart rhythm disturbances. "
What causes Friedreich's ataxia syndrome?,"""Friedreich's ataxia syndrome is caused by a mutation or defect in the gene known as FXN, which leads to the production of a protein called frataxin. The condition is ""'inherited'"" in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that peoples who must inherit two defective copies of the gene, one from each parent, to develop the disease. \xa0Both males and females can be affected by Friedreich's ataxia syndrome."" "
What procedures and tests diagnose Friedreich's ataxia syndrome?,"'Genetic testing for the mutation in the FXN gene can provide the definitive diagnosis. Other tests to measure nerve and muscle function are also sometimes used to establish the diagnosis, including an ''electromyogram'' (''EMG''), which measures the electrical activity of muscle cells, and nerve conduction studies, which measure the speed of nerve signaling. Imaging tests such as CT or ''MRI'' scans may be used to rule out other causes of the symptoms.' "
What is the treatment and cure for Friedreich's ataxia syndrome?,"""There is currently no effective treatment or cure for Friedreich's ataxia syndrome, and the symptoms cannot be reversed. Treatments are directed at improving quality of life and managing symptoms. For example, heart problems can be treated with medication, and orthopedic complications such as deformities and scoliosis can be corrected with surgery or bracing. Physical therapy, speech therapy, and ""'hearing'' aids may be useful for some people with the condition. \xa0' "
What is the prognosis and life-expectancy for Friedreich's ataxia syndrome?,"""As discussed previously, the rate at which the symptoms worsen varies among affected people. Most people are confined to a wheelchair within 10 to 20 years after the appearance of the first symptoms. Later in the disease, those affected may become incapacitated. Friedreich's ataxia syndrome can shorten life expectancy, but some people with less severe symptoms live into their sixties or older. The most common cause of death is ""'heart disease''.' "
What research is being done for Friedreich's ataxia syndrome?,"""Research efforts on Friedreich's ataxia syndrome focus on many different aspects of the disease, including the exact cause of the FXN gene mutation, better understanding the function of frataxin, and examining possible ways to overcome the genetic mutation that could contribute to treatments for the disease. \xa0"" "
What is frontotemporal dementia?,"'Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinical syndrome associated with shrinking of the frontal and temporal anterior lobes of the brain. Originally known as Pick’s disease, the name and classification of FTD has been a topic of discussion for over a century. The current designation of the syndrome groups together Pick’s disease, primary progressive ''aphasia'', and semantic dementia as FTD. Some doctors propose adding ''corticobasal degeneration'' and ''progressive supranuclear palsy'' to FTD and calling the group Pick Complex. These designations will continue to be debated.' "
What are the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia?,"'As it is defined today, the symptoms of FTD fall into two clinical patterns that involve either (1) changes in behavior, or (2) problems with language.''The first type features behavior that can be either impulsive (disinhibited) or bored and listless (apathetic) and includes''The second type primarily features symptoms of language disturbance, including difficulty making or understanding speech, often in conjunction with the behavioral type’s symptoms.''Spatial skills and memory remain intact.'   inappropriate social behavior; lack of social tact; lack of empathy; distractibility; loss of insight into the behaviors of oneself and others; an increased interest in sex; changes in food preferences; agitation or, conversely, blunted emotions; neglect of personal hygiene; repetitive or compulsive behavior, and decreased energy and motivation."
Is frontotemporal dementia inherited?,'There is a strong genetic component to the disease; FTD often runs in families.' 
Is there any treatment for frontotemporal dementia?,"'No treatment has been shown to slow the progression of FTD. Behavior modification may help control unacceptable or dangerous behaviors. Aggressive, agitated, or dangerous behaviors could require medication. ''Antidepressants'' have been shown to improve some symptoms.'  "
What is the prognosis (the outlook) for frontotemporal dementia?,"'The outcome for people with FTD is poor. The disease progresses steadily and often rapidly, ranging from less than 2 years in some individuals to more than 10 years in others. Eventually some individuals with FTD will need 24-hour care and monitoring at home or in an institutionalized care setting.'  "
What research is being done on frontotemporal dementia?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and fund research on FTD. Among several research projects, scientists hope to identify novel genes involved with FTD, perhaps leading to therapeutic approaches where delivery of normal genes would improve or restore brain function. Clinical imaging may help researchers better understand changes in the brains of people with FTD, as well as help diagnose these disorders. Other projects are aimed at better understanding the toxic effects of protein buildup and how it is related to the development of FTD and related dementias.' "

What type of injuries can be caused by cold weather?,"'Winter cold and snow provide a number of opportunities to get outside and participate in activities such as skiing, sledding, and snowmobiling. However, without proper protection, cold weather-related injuries can occur even when temperatures are above freezing (32 F, 0 C). This is especially true if there are high winds or if clothing is wet. In general, however, it is both the temperature and the duration of exposure that play a role in determining the extent and severity of cold weather-related injuries. This information describes the different types of cold weather-related injuries, as well as what to do to prevent and treat them prior to reaching a healthcare professional.''Cold weather-related injuries can be divided into two general categories.''Hypothermia'' is a medical condition characterized by a core body temperature that is abnormally low.' Conditions that occur without the freezing of body tissue, for example, chilblains, trench foot, and frostnip. Injuries that occur with the freezing of body tissue, such as frostbite."
What are the superficial and severe frostbite stages?,"'Frostbite occurs when there is freezing of body tissue, and it is the most serious of the cold weather-related injuries. Frostbite usually affects the hands, ''feet'', nose, ears, and cheeks, though other areas of the body may also be affected. This type of injury results from decreased blood flow and heat delivery to body tissues resulting in damaging ice crystal formation, which ultimately leads to cell death. Upon rewarming of the affected tissue, vascular damage and complex cellular metabolic abnormalities lead to tissue death.''Damage to tissue is most pronounced when there is prolonged cold weather exposure, the affected area slowly freezes, and the subsequent rewarming process is slow. Repeated thawing and refreezing of the affected tissue is particularly damaging, and should always be avoided.''Frostbite injuries can be classified as either superficial or deep, depending on the tissue depth of injury.''Superficial frostbite injuries'' involve the skin and subcutaneous tissues and ''Deep frostbite injuries'' extend beyond the subcutaneous tissues and involve the tendons, muscles, nerves, and even bone. Superficial frostbite injuries have a better prognosis than deep frostbite injuries.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of frostnip?,"'Frostnip is a mild cold weather-related injury that typically affects the face, cheeks, lips, ears, toes, and fingers. Symptoms of frostnip usually occur after exposure to cold weather. The area(s) may appear pale, be accompanied by burning, ''itching'' or ''pain'', tingle, and feels numb. Simple rewarming restores normal color and sensation, and there is no subsequent permanent tissue damage.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of chilblains?,"'Chilblains (also known as pernio) are a common type of cold weather-related injury that can develop in predisposed individuals after exposure to nonfreezing temperatures and humid conditions. Chilblains typically develop because of an abnormal vascular response several hours after the area exposed to cold is re-warmed.''Chilblains are ''itchy'', painful, reddish, or purplish areas of swelling that usually affect the fingers, toes, nose, or ears. In some individuals, blisters or small open sores may form, increasing the risk for developing an infection. Chilblains usually last for several days, and the affected area usually heals after several weeks. Though the affected area may remain sensitive to the cold in the future, there is usually no permanent damage. It is not uncommon for chilblains to recur in susceptible individuals.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of trench foot?,"'Trench foot also referred to as immersion foot was named after the condition suffered by many soldiers in the trenches during World War I, though it is a condition still encountered today, often in homeless individuals. Trench foot develops after a prolonged exposure to a wet, cold, environment and is typically a more serious condition than chilblains. Tight-fitting, constricting boots and footwear serve to exacerbate the condition. Trench foot does not require freezing temperatures, and can occur with temperatures of up to 60 F (15.5 C).''The symptoms of trench foot may include pain, ''itching'', numbness, and swelling. The foot area may appear red or blotchy (red and pale areas mixed together) or even bluish-black with advanced injury. Blisters and open sores can develop. In severe trench foot, the tissue dies and sloughs off, and the development of gangrene can occur, sometimes requiring amputation of the area(s) where the frostbite occured.' "
When should you call a doctor if you have frostnip or frostbite?,"'Chilblains'' can generally be treated at home, though if signs of infection develop from an open sore, individuals should consult a health-care professional. Patients with recurrent chilblains should also seek medical care, as there may be another underlying disease process leading to this condition.''Frostnip'' can be managed at home, and this condition does not typically require further evaluation.''Individuals with ''trench foot'' should generally consult a health-care professional to assess the degree of injury and to monitor for any signs of infection or gangrene.''Individuals with ''frostbite'' or suspected frostbite should immediately go to an emergency room. Furthermore, these individuals may also be suffering from hypothermia, which requires additional treatment and evaluation, and may constitute a life-threatening condition. These are serious cold weather-related injuries that may require admission to a hospital.' "
How is frostbite diagnosed?, 
What is the first aid treatment for frostbite?,"'The initial treatment for any cold weather-related injury involves removing yourself or others from the precipitating cold environment, if possible, to prevent further heat loss.''It is important to note that some of these individuals may also be suffering from hypothermia, a potentially life-threatening condition.'  Move indoors, and remove all wet clothing and constricting clothing (such as socks, boots, and gloves), and replace with dry clothing. Avoid massaging or rubbing the affected area, as this will only aggravate the injury. Gradually rewarm the affected area, and treatment can generally be accomplished at home. Some individuals may benefit from various lotions, while others may require treatment with corticosteroid creams. If open sores develop, they should remain clean and be monitored for signs of infection. Frostnip will generally improve with conservative rewarming measures at home. Frostnip to the hands, for example, can be treated by breathing into cupped hands or placing the hands in the armpit area. Alternatively, the affected area can be submerged in warm water until normal sensation is restored. Individuals with trench foot should have their wet shoes and socks removed, and the feet should be elevated, cleaned and air dried. Depending on the severity of the condition, some individuals may require antibiotics and/or surgical management of infection or wet gangrene (tissue destruction by bacterial infection, usually Clostridium spp). Frostbite requires immediate medical attention. Ideally, treatment should be instituted in a health-care facility, when possible. Prior to transport to a health-care facility, if possible, loosely wrap the affected area in a dry sterile bandage or a clean blanket to prevent further trauma. Cotton may be placed between the toes or fingers, if affected, to prevent any potential damaging effects of rubbing against one another. The most effective treatment measure for frostbite is rapid rewarming. This is accomplished by immersing the affected area into a circulating tub of warmed water that is between 40 to 42 C (104 to 108 F) for 20 to 40 minutes or until thawing is complete. Warm wet packs at the same temperature may be used if a tub is not available.It is important NOT to rapidly rewarm and thaw the affected area if there is a risk that it may refreeze. This leads to more severe tissue damage and must be avoided.During the rewarming process, the pain may be extreme and oral or intravenous analgesics may be required. It is important NOT to rapidly rewarm and thaw the affected area if there is a risk that it may refreeze. This leads to more severe tissue damage and must be avoided. During the rewarming process, the pain may be extreme and oral or intravenous analgesics may be required. After rapid rewarming is complete, the affected area should be dressed and splinted. Further treatment will focus on wound care, pain control, and providing a tetanus vaccine booster shot, if needed. Surgical consultation may be obtained for managing wound care, as well as for the longer-term sequelae of serious frostbite injuries that my require amputation of gangrenous tissue."
How long does it take to recover from frostbite or frostnip?,"'The recovery time for a frostbite injury depends on the extent of tissue injury and whether or not there are any subsequent complications, such as infection. It may take 1 to 3 months before it is possible to determine the extent of tissue damage, and to clearly delineate which tissue is still viable. Some individuals will require debridement, skin grafting, or amputation of the affected area. Some patients will experience long-term sequelae from frostbite injuries, such as sensitivity to the cold with associated pain or burning, ''arthritis'', increased ''sweating'', and tingling of the affected area. Rarely, death occurs from infection-related complications.'  "
9 Tips to prevent frostbite.,"'Anybody can develop a cold weather-related injury.''The prevention of cold weather-related injuries is best achieved through careful pre-planning and preparation for the cold, when possible.' The young and the elderly are more prone to these types of injuries due to vascular compromise or inability to effectively redistribute body heat. In addition, individuals who work outdoors, the homeless, and those who engage in outdoor activities are more likely to develop cold weather-related injuries due to their increased chance and time of exposure to the cold conditions. Alcohol and illicit drug use also make it more likely that individuals will develop a cold weather-related injury because these individuals have impaired judgment and they may not sense that they are in danger. Patients with certain medical conditions including psychiatric illness, circulatory problems, diabetes, dehydration, and smoking can develop a cold weather-related injury more quickly than other individuals. Travel with another person in case an emergency occurs. Take along an emergency kit and blankets in your car in case of a breakdown or accident. Dress warmly using multiple layers and adequately cover body areas prone to injury. Try to have an extra change of dry clothing so you can remove any wet clothing if necessary. Always keep your hands and feet dry and avoid wearing tight fitting clothing on these areas as it may decrease the circulation. Use waterproof shoes. Drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol, caffeinated drinks, and smoking. Carry high-calorie snacks to provide adequate nutrition. Most importantly, however, move indoors to a warmer environment when you begin to feel cold."
What should I know about frostbite?,"'Frostbite is severe damage to tissues from temperatures below 95F and 35C rectally due to the formation of ice crystals within cells, rupturing the cells and leading to cell death.

"
What are the 3 stages of frostbite (pictures)?,'The appearance of frostbite may gradually change over time; the extent of the change depends on how severely the tissue is damaged. Figure 1 shows a hand with severe frostbite changes at the tips of the fingers and thumb (dark to black-appearing tissue) that gradually decreases in severity on the digits.''Figure 1. Frostbite on digits and thumb' 
What are the early signs and symptoms of frostbite?,"'The signs and symptoms of frostbite depend on the extent and depth of tissue injury. People with superficial frostbite may experience the following signs and symptoms to the affected area.''As the degree of injury progresses it goes deeper into the skin layers and the body temperature is between 95F and 35C through the rectum. Frostbite signs and symptoms of deep frostbite can develop, which may include''With advanced frostbite injuries, the affected area can subsequently appear blackened and ''gangrene'' can develop, placing the affected individual at high-risk for infection.'

What is a frozen shoulder?,'A frozen shoulder is a shoulder joint with significant loss of its range of motion in all directions. The range of motion is limited not only when the patient attempts motion but also when the doctor attempts to move the joint fully while the patient relaxes. A frozen shoulder is medically referred to as adhesive capsulitis.' 
What causes a frozen shoulder?,"'Frozen shoulder is the result of inflammation, scarring, thickening, and shrinkage of the capsule that surrounds the normal shoulder joint. Any shoulder injury can lead to a frozen shoulder, including tendinitis, ''bursitis'', and ''rotator cuff injury'' (''rotator cuff'' syndrome). Adhesive capsulitis occurs more frequently in patients with risk factors of ''diabetes'', chronic inflammatory ''arthritis'' of the shoulder, or after chest or breast surgery. Long-term immobility of the shoulder joint can put people at risk to develop a frozen shoulder.'  "
What are symptoms and signs of a frozen shoulder?,"'Symptoms and signs of a frozen shoulder include ''shoulder pain'', stiffness, and loss of range of shoulder motion. The shoulder range of motion is limited when either the patient or an examiner attempts to move the joint. The shoulder can develop increased ''pain'' with use. These symptoms can make ''sleep'' very uncomfortable.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose a frozen shoulder?,"'A frozen shoulder is suggested during examination when the shoulder range of motion is significantly limited, with either the patient or the examiner attempting the movement. Underlying diseases involving the shoulder can be diagnosed with the history, examination, blood testing, and X-ray examination of the shoulder.''If necessary, the diagnosis can be confirmed when an X-ray contrast dye is injected into the shoulder joint to demonstrate the characteristic shrunken shoulder capsule of a frozen shoulder. This X-ray test is called arthrography. The tissues of the shoulder can also be evaluated with an ''MRI'' scan.' "
What conditions can mimic adhesive capsulitis?,"'Inflammation of the shoulder joint (arthritis) or the muscles around the shoulder and ''degenerative arthritis'' of the shoulder joint can cause swelling, pain, or stiffness of the joint that can mimic the range of motion limitation of a frozen shoulder.''Injury to individual tendons around the shoulder (tendons of the ''rotator cuff'') can limit shoulder-joint range of motion but usually not in all directions. Often during the examination of a shoulder with tendon injury (tendinitis or tendon tear), the doctor is able to move the joint with the patient relaxed beyond the range that the patient can on their own.' "
What is the treatment for a frozen shoulder?,"'The treatment of a frozen shoulder usually requires an aggressive combination of ''over-the-counter'' non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, ''cortisone injection''(s) into the shoulder, and physical therapy (physiotherapy). Without aggressive treatment, adhesive capsulitis can be permanent.''Diligent physical therapy is often essential for recovery. A physical therapist will administer ''ultrasound'', electric stimulation, range-of-motion ''exercise'' maneuvers, stretching, ice packs, and eventually strengthening exercises. Physical therapy can take weeks to months for recovery, depending on the severity of the scarring of the tissues around the shoulder.''It is very important for people with a frozen shoulder to avoid reinjuring the shoulder tissues during the rehabilitation period. These individuals should avoid sudden, jerking motions of or heavy lifting with the affected shoulder.''Sometimes a frozen shoulders is resistant to treatment. Patients with resistant frozen shoulders can be considered for release of the ''scar tissue'' by arthroscopic surgery or manipulation of the scarred shoulder under anesthesia. This manipulation is performed to physically break up the ''scar'' tissue of the joint capsule. It carries the risk of breaking the arm bone (humerus ''fracture''). It is very important for patients that undergo manipulation to partake in an active ''exercise'' program for the shoulder after the procedure. It is only with continued exercise of the shoulder that mobility and function is optimized.'  "
What is the prognosis of a frozen shoulder?,"'The prognosis of a frozen shoulder depends on its response to physical therapy, exercises, and treatments as described above. Again, it is essential to avoid reinjuring the shoulder tissues during the rehabilitation period. Patients with resistant frozen shoulders can be considered for release of the scar tissue by arthroscopic surgery or manipulation of the scarred shoulder under anesthesia. Without aggressive treatment, a frozen shoulder can be permanent.'  "
Is it possible to prevent a frozen shoulder?,'Prevention'' of a frozen shoulder involves avoiding injury or reinjury to the shoulder.' 
What is frontotemporal dementia?,"'Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinical syndrome associated with shrinking of the frontal and temporal anterior lobes of the brain. Originally known as Pick’s disease, the name and classification of FTD has been a topic of discussion for over a century. The current designation of the syndrome groups together Pick’s disease, primary progressive ''aphasia'', and semantic dementia as FTD. Some doctors propose adding ''corticobasal degeneration'' and ''progressive supranuclear palsy'' to FTD and calling the group Pick Complex. These designations will continue to be debated.' "
What are the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia?,"'As it is defined today, the symptoms of FTD fall into two clinical patterns that involve either (1) changes in behavior, or (2) problems with language.''The first type features behavior that can be either impulsive (disinhibited) or bored and listless (apathetic) and includes''The second type primarily features symptoms of language disturbance, including difficulty making or understanding speech, often in conjunction with the behavioral type’s symptoms.''Spatial skills and memory remain intact.'   inappropriate social behavior; lack of social tact; lack of empathy; distractibility; loss of insight into the behaviors of oneself and others; an increased interest in sex; changes in food preferences; agitation or, conversely, blunted emotions; neglect of personal hygiene; repetitive or compulsive behavior, and decreased energy and motivation."
Is frontotemporal dementia inherited?,'There is a strong genetic component to the disease; FTD often runs in families.' 
Is there any treatment for frontotemporal dementia?,"'No treatment has been shown to slow the progression of FTD. Behavior modification may help control unacceptable or dangerous behaviors. Aggressive, agitated, or dangerous behaviors could require medication. ''Antidepressants'' have been shown to improve some symptoms.'  "
What is the prognosis (the outlook) for frontotemporal dementia?,"'The outcome for people with FTD is poor. The disease progresses steadily and often rapidly, ranging from less than 2 years in some individuals to more than 10 years in others. Eventually some individuals with FTD will need 24-hour care and monitoring at home or in an institutionalized care setting.'  "
What research is being done on frontotemporal dementia?,"'The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and fund research on FTD. Among several research projects, scientists hope to identify novel genes involved with FTD, perhaps leading to therapeutic approaches where delivery of normal genes would improve or restore brain function. Clinical imaging may help researchers better understand changes in the brains of people with FTD, as well as help diagnose these disorders. Other projects are aimed at better understanding the toxic effects of protein buildup and how it is related to the development of FTD and related dementias.' "

What Is Epilepsy Surgery?,"'Most people with ''epilepsy'' can control their ''seizures'"" with medication. But they aren't effective for about 30% of patients. In some cases, brain surgery may be an option.""'Epilepsy'' surgery is an operation on the brain to control ''seizures'"" and improve the person's quality of life. There are two main types of ""'epilepsy'' surgery:''Surgery is considered only if the area of the brain where the seizures start, called the ''seizure'' focus, can be clearly identified, and if the area to be removed is not responsible for any critical functions, such as language, sensation and movement. Extensive evaluation and testing are necessary to determine if surgery is appropriate.' Surgery to remove the area of the brain producing seizures. Surgery to interrupt the nerve pathways through which seizure impulses spread within the brain."
Who Is a Candidate for Epilepsy Surgery?,"""Surgery may be an option for people with epilepsy whose seizures are disabling and/or are not controlled by medication, or when the side effects of medication are severe and greatly affect the person's quality of life. Patients with other serious medical problems, such as ""'cancer'' or ''heart disease'', usually are not considered for epilepsy surgery.' "
What Surgical Options Are Available?,"'Different surgical procedures are available to treat epilepsy. The type of surgery used depends on the type of seizures and the area of the brain where the seizures start. The surgical options include:' Lobe resection: The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum, is divided into four paired sections, called lobes -- the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. Temporal lobe epilepsy, in which the seizure focus is located within the temporal lobe, is the most common type of epilepsy in teens and adults. In a temporal lobe resection, brain tissue in the temporal lobe is resected, or cut away, to remove the seizure focus. The anterior (front) and mesial (deep middle) portions of the temporal lobe are the areas most often involved. Extratemporal resection involves removing brain tissue from areas outside of the temporal lobe. Lesionectomy: This is surgery to remove isolated brain lesions -- areas of injury or defect such as a tumor or malformed blood vessel -- that are responsible for seizure activity. Seizures usually stop once the lesion is removed. 
 Corpus callosotomy: The corpus callosum is a band of nerve fibers connecting the two halves (hemispheres) of the brain. A corpus callosotomy is an operation in which all or part of this structure is cut, disabling communication between the hemispheres and preventing the spread of seizures from one side of the brain to the other. This procedure, sometimes called split-brain surgery, is for patients with extreme forms of uncontrollable epilepsy who have intense seizures that can lead to violent falls and potentially serious injury. Functional hemispherectomy: This is a variation of a hemispherectomy, a radical procedure in which one entire hemisphere, or one half of the brain, is removed. With a functional hemispherectomy, one hemisphere is disconnected from the rest of the brain, but only a limited area of brain tissue is removed. This surgery generally is limited to children younger than 13 years old who have one hemisphere that is not functioning normally. Multiple subpial transection (MST): This procedure is used to help control seizures that begin in areas of the brain that cannot be safely removed. The surgeon makes a series of shallow cuts (transections) in the brain tissue. These cuts interrupt the movement of seizure impulses but do not disturb normal brain activity, leaving the person's abilities intact."
How Effective Is Epilepsy Surgery?,"'The effectiveness varies, depending on the type of surgery. Some people are completely free of seizures after surgery. For others, the frequency of seizures is significantly reduced. In some cases, surgery may not be successful and a second surgery (re-operation) may be recommended. Most patients will need to continue taking anti-seizure medication for a year or more after surgery. Once seizure control is established, medications may be reduced or eliminated.' "
What Are the Risks of Epilepsy Surgery?,"'The risks of epilepsy surgery include:' Risks associated with surgery: These include infection and bleeding, as well as the risk of an allergic reaction to the anesthesia. Risk of neurological deficits: Surgery can worsen existing problems or create new problems with the way the brain functions. Neurological deficits include loss of functions such as vision, speech, memory or movement. Risk of surgery failure: Even with careful pre-surgical evaluation, surgery may not eliminate or reduce seizures. Before undergoing surgery your doctor will discuss the potential risks and benefits of the procedure. Before undergoing surgery your doctor will discuss the potential risks and benefits of the procedure."
Re-operations,"'In some cases, isolated seizures may occur immediately following surgery. This does not necessarily mean the operation was not successful. Occasionally, a second operation, or re-operation, is needed to remove brain tissue that is later found to be a source of seizure activity.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is fundoplication?,"   Fundoplication is the standard surgical method for treating gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD causes inflammation, pain (heartburn), and other serious complications (such as scarring and stricture) of the esophagus. GERD results when acid refluxes (regurgitates, or backwashes) from the stomach back up into the esophagus. Under normal conditions, there is a barrier to the reflux of acid from the stomach. One part of this barrier is the lower-most muscle of the esophagus (called the lower esophageal sphincter). Most of the time, this muscle is contracted (constricted, or tight), which closes off the esophagus from the stomach. In patients with GERD, the sphincter does not function normally. The muscle is either weak or relaxes inappropriately. Fundoplication is a surgical technique that strengthens the barrier to acid reflux when the sphincter does not function normally."
What happens during fundoplication?,"'During the fundoplication procedure, the part of the stomach that is closest to the entry of the esophagus (the fundus of the stomach) is gathered, wrapped, and sutured (sewn) around the lower end of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter. (The gathering and suturing of one tissue to another is called plication.) This procedure increases the pressure at the lower end of the esophagus and thereby reduces acid reflux.''Also, during fundoplication, other surgical steps frequently are taken that also may reduce acid reflux. For instance, if the patient has a ''hiatal hernia'' (which occurs in 80% of patients with GERD), the contents of the ''hernia'' sac (the stomach) may be pulled down from the chest and the opening the ''diaphragm'' (the hiatus) through which the esophagus passes from the chest into the abdomen sutured so that stomach remains within the abdomen. Fundoplication may be done using a large incision (laparotomy in the abdomen or thoracotomy in the chest) or a laparoscope, which requires only several small punctures in the abdomen. The advantage of the laparoscopic method is a speedier recovery and less post-operative ''pain''.' "
What are alternatives to fundoplication?,"'Although fundoplication is the standard surgical method for treating GERD, endoscopic methods for treating GERD are being developed. ''Endoscopy'' utilizes endoscopes, which are long flexible tubes that are passed by the doctor through the mouth into the esophagus and stomach. The inside of the esophagus can be viewed through the endoscope and various instruments can be passed through channels in the endoscope.''In one endoscopic method for treating GERD, an instrument is inserted that delivers an electrical current to the lower esophageal sphincter. This results in scarring which tightens the sphincter. In asecond method, ''sutures'' are placed in the sphincter to tighten the sphincter. Another treatment for GERD invloves placing a ring around the lower esophageal sphincter to prevent acid from refluxing into the esophagus. This is called the LINX procedure.''Other methods also have been employed experimentally. Endoscopic methods offer a simpler way of treating GERD than fundoplication. As more data is being accumulated as to how effective, safe, or long-lasting they are, their use is increasing.' "
What is fungal arthritis?,'Fungal arthritis is inflammation of a joint by a fungus microorganism that has invaded the body and is growing in the normally sterile joint. Fungal infection of a joint is a serious condition that can lead to permanent damage to the joint with loss of function. Fungal arthritis is also referred to as mycotic arthritis.' 
What causes fungal arthritis?,"'Fungal arthritis is usually caused by the fungus traveling through the bloodstream to reside in the joint. This manner of infection through the blood is referred to as hematogenous spread.''Alternatively, if medication that is contaminated by fungus is directly injected into the joint, fungal arthritis can result. This manner of infection by directly injecting the fungus into the joint is referred to as exogenous inoculation. Rarely, fungal infection can result from a contaminated prosthesis used in joint replacement surgery.''Fungal organisms that can cause fungal arthritis include ''Candida'', ''Aspergillus'', and ''Exserohilum'' species.' "
What are the risks for developing fungal arthritis?,"'Fungal arthritis in people with normal immune systems is rare. One risk for developing fungal arthritis in such people is the accidental injection of medications that are contaminated with fungus microbes in the vials used. This, in fact, was the situation when contaminated vials of medications produced by a compounding pharmacy (New England Compounding Center) caused a multistate outbreak of rare ''fungal meningitis'' and fungal arthritis in September 2012.''People with abnormally suppressed immune systems are at risk for ''fungal infections'', including fungal arthritis. This includes people with severely low white blood counts (''neutropenia''), ''HIV'' infection, injection drug abusers, and those taking chronic cortisone medication.' "
What are fungal arthritis symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of fungal arthritis include ''pain'', heat, swelling, warmth, redness, and loss of range of motion of the affected joint. The most common joint to develop fungal arthritis is the ''knee joint''. ''Fever'' may or may not be present.''Symptoms of fungal arthritis typically become manifest weeks to months after the initial infection of the joint. Ultimately, fungal arthritis can potentially permanently damage the involved joint.' "
What specialists treat fungal arthritis?,'Fungal arthritis is a medical emergency. It is treated by infectious-disease specialists together with orthopedic surgeons.' 
How is fungal arthritis diagnosed?,"'Fungal arthritis is considered when a patient whose immune system is compromised develops inflammation of a joint. Blood tests can include testing the blood for the white blood count, inflammation markers (''sedimentation rate'', or ESR, and ''C-reactive protein'', or CRP), and cultures of the blood. Plain X-ray images, ''CAT scanning'', and/or ''MRI'' scanning can be used to determine the character and extent of joint damage. Ultimately, joint fluid is aspirated from the joint with a needle and syringe and this fluid is analyzed in the laboratory to culture the precise fungal organism and establish the diagnosis.'  "
What is the treatment for fungal arthritis?,"'Fungal arthritis is treated with antibiotics that are directed against the precise fungal microbe that is causing the joint infection. Examples of antibiotics for fungal arthritis include amphotericin B, ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan''), and caspofungin (''Cancidas''). Adequate drainage of the infected joint is an additional essential part of the treatment. This generally requires orthopedic surgical procedures.'  "
Are there home remedies for fungal arthritis?,'No. There are no home remedies for fungal arthritis.' 
What is the prognosis of fungal arthritis?,'The outlook for fungal arthritis is directly related to how much damage occurs to the cartilage and bone of the joint. Earlier treatment leads to optimal outcomes.' 
Is it possible to prevent fungal arthritis?,'Fungal arthritis can be prevented by minimizing the risks of immune suppression and avoiding intravenous ''drug abuse''. Fungal arthritis can also be prevented by active sterilization measures by companies producing injectable medications.' 
Causes,"'Fungal meningitis is rare and usually the result of spread of a fungus through blood to the spinal cord. Although anyone can get fungal meningitis, people with weakened immune systems, like those with ''HIV'' infection or ''cancer'', are at higher risk.''The most common cause of fungal meningitis for people with weakened immune systems is ''Cryptococcus''. This disease is one of the most common causes of adult meningitis in Africa.' "
Transmission,"'Fungal meningitis is not contagious'', which means it is not transmitted from person to person. Fungal meningitis can develop after a fungus spreads through the bloodstream from somewhere else in the body, as a result of the fungus being introduced directly into the central nervous system, or from an infected body site infection next to the central nervous system.''You may also get fungal meningitis after taking medications that weaken your immune system. Examples of these medications include steroids (such as ''prednisone''), medications given after organ transplantation, or anti-TNF medications, which are sometimes given for treatment of ''rheumatoid arthritis'' or other autoimmune conditions.''Different types of fungus are transmitted in several ways. ''Cryptococcus'' is thought to be acquired through inhaling soil contaminated with bird droppings, and ''Histoplasma'' is found in environments with heavy contamination of bird or bat droppings, particularly in the Midwest near the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. ''Blastomyces'' is thought to exist in soil rich in decaying organic matter in the Midwest United States, particularly the northern Midwest. '' Coccidioides'' is found in the soil of endemic areas (Southwestern US and parts of Central and South America). When these environments are disturbed, the fungal spores can be inhaled. Meningitis results from the fungal infection spreading to the spinal cord. ''Candida'' is usually acquired in a hospital setting.' "
Risk Factors,"'Certain diseases, medications, and surgical procedures may weaken the immune system and increase your risk of getting fungal infection, which can lead to fungal meningitis. Premature ''babies'' with very low birth weights are also at increased risk for getting ''Candida'' blood stream infection, which may spread to the brain.''Living in certain areas of the United States may increase your risk for fungal lung infections, which can also spread to the brain. For example, bird and bat droppings in the Midwestern United States may contain ''Histoplasma'', and soil in the Southwestern United States may contain ''Coccidioides''.''African Americans, Filipinos, ''pregnant'' women in the ''third trimester'', and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to get ''Coccidiodes'' infection, which is also called ''valley fever''.' "
Signs and Symptoms,'Signs and symptoms of fungal meningitis may include the following:' Fever Headache Stiff neck Nausea and vomiting Photophobia (sensitivity to light) Altered mental status
Diagnosis,"'If meningitis is suspected, samples of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (near the spinal cord) are collected and sent to a laboratory for testing. Knowing the specific cause of meningitis is important because the severity of illness and the treatment will differ depending on the cause.''To confirm fungal meningitis, specific lab tests can be performed, depending on the type of fungus suspected.' "
Treatment,"'Fungal meningitis is treated with long courses of high dose antifungal medications, usually given through an IV line in the hospital. The length of treatment depends on the status of the immune system and the type of fungus that caused the infection. For people with immune systems that do not function well because of other conditions, like ''AIDS'', ''diabetes'', or ''cancer'', treatment is often longer.' "
Prevention,"'No specific activities are known to cause fungal meningitis. Avoid soil and other environments that are likely to contain fungus. People with weakened immune systems (for example, those with ''HIV'' infection) should try to avoid bird droppings and avoid digging and dusty activities, particularly if they live in a geographic region where fungi like ''Histoplasma'', ''Coccidioides'', or ''Blastomyces'' species exist. HIV-infected people cannot completely avoid exposure.' "
"Facts you should know about fungal nails (onychomycosis, tinea unguium)","'Many changes in fingernails or toenails may cause people to think they have a fungal infection of the nails, medically known as ''onychomycosis'' or ''tinea unguium''.''Fungal infection of the nails sometimes makes the condition sound ''contagious'' or related to ''poor hygiene''. In fact, up to 10% of all adults in Western countries have fungal infection of the nails. This percentage increases to 20% of adults who are age 60 or older. ''Toenail fungus'' is much more common than fingernail fungus.''In reality, abnormal-looking nails may be caused by a number of conditions including, but not limited to, fungal infection. There are many other reasons why your nails may look different.' "
What other conditions can be mistaken for fungal nails?,"'Here are some other conditions you may have instead of ''fungal nails'':' Lines and ridges: These are common and may be considered normal. They may worsen during pregnancy. A large groove down the center of the nail can be caused by nail biting. Some people may develop these changes following chemotherapy. Senile nails: As you age, the nails become brittle and develop ridges and separation of the nail layers at the end of the nail. To avoid this, try to clean solutions and don't soak the nails in water. Whitish or yellowish nails can occur due to onycholysis. This means separation of the nail from the nail bed. The color you see is air beneath the nail. The treatment is to trim the nail short, don't clean under it, polish if you want to hide the color, and wait two to three months. Persistent onycholysis can make the nails susceptible to fungal infection. Red or black nails due to a hematoma, or blood under the nail, usually occur from trauma (like whacking yourself on the thumb with a hammer). The discolored area will grow out with the nail and be trimmed off as you trim your nails. If you have a black spot under your nail that was not caused by trauma, you may want to see a dermatologist or a podiatrist if it involves a toenail to make sure it is not melanoma (a type of skin cancer associated with pigmented cells). A simple biopsy can rule out malignancy (cancer). Green nails can be caused by Pseudomonas bacteria, which grow under a nail that has partially separated from the nail bed. This infection may cause a foul odor of the nails. The treatment is to trim the nail short every four weeks, don't clean it, polish if you want to hide the color, and wait two to three months. It is also advised to avoid soaking the nail in any sort of water (even if inside gloves) and to thoroughly dry the nail after bathing. If the problem continues, there are prescription treatments that your doctor may try. Pitted nails may be associated with psoriasis or other skin problems that affect the nail matrix, the area under the skin just behind the nail. This is the area from which the nail grows. Nails affected by psoriasis can also be tan in color. Swelling and redness of the skin around the nail is called paronychia. This is an infection of the skin at the bottom of the nail (cuticle). If the infection is acute (has a rapid onset), it is usually caused by bacteria. It may respond to warm soaks but will often need to be drained by a doctor. A chronic paronychia occurs when a cuticle becomes inflamed or irritated over time. Sometimes, yeast will take advantage of the damaged skin and infect the area as well. Therapy begins with keeping the skin dry and out of water. If the problem continues, a physician should be consulted. Antibiotics are not often used but may be necessary in severe infection. Chronic nail trauma, such as repeatedly starting and stopping, kicking, and other athletic endeavors, can cause damage to the nails that can look a lot like fungal nails. This sort of repetitive trauma can also occur with certain types of employment or wearing tight-fitting shoes. Some traumas may cause permanent changes that may mimic the appearance of fungal nails."
"What causes fungal nails, and what are some of the risk factors?","'In normal, healthy people, ''fungal infections'' of the nails are most commonly caused by fungus that is caught from moist, wet areas. Communal showers, such as those at a gym or ''swimming'' pools, are common sources. Going to nail salons that use inadequate sanitization of instruments (such as clippers, filers, and foot tubs) in addition to living with family members who have fungal nails are also risk factors. Athletes have been proven to be more susceptible to ''nail fungus''. This is presumed to be due to the wearing of tight-fitting, sweaty shoes associated with repetitive trauma to the toenails. Having '""athlete's foot""' makes it more likely that the fungus will infect your toenails. Repetitive trauma also weakens the nail, which makes the nail more susceptible to fungal infection.''Elderly people and people with certain underlying disease states are also at higher risk. Anything that impairs your immune system can make you prone to getting infected with the fungus. These include conditions such as ''AIDS'', ''diabetes'', ''cancer'', ''psoriasis'', or taking any immunosuppressive medications like steroids.' "
Are fungal nails contagious?,"'While the fungus must be obtained from someplace, it is not highly contagious. Nail fungus is so common that finding more than one person in a household who has it is hardly more than a coincidence. It can be transmitted from person to person but only with constant intimate contact.' "
What are fungal nail symptoms and signs?,"'Although fungal nails are usually cosmetic concerns, some patients do experience ''pain'' and discomfort. These symptoms may be exacerbated by footwear, activity, and improper trimming of the nails.''There are many species of fungi that can affect nails. By far the most common, however, is called ''Trichophyton rubrum ''(''T. rubrum''). This type of fungus has a tendency to infect the skin (known as a dermatophyte) and manifests in the following specific ways.'   Starts at the ends of the nails and raises the nail up: This is called ""distal subungual onychomycosis."" It is the most common type of fungal infection of the nails in both adults and children. It is more common in the toes than the fingers, and the great toe is usually the first one to be affected. Risk factors include older age, swimming, athlete's foot, psoriasis, diabetes, family members with the infection, or a suppressed immune system. It usually starts as a discolored area at a corner of the big toe and slowly spreads toward the cuticle. Eventually, the toenails will become thickened and flaky. Sometimes, you can also see signs of athlete's foot in between the toes or skin peeling on the sole of the foot. It is often accompanied by onycholysis. The most common cause is T. rubrum. Starts at the base of the nail and raises the nail up: This is called ""proximal subungual onychomycosis."" This is the least common type of fungal nail. It is similar to the distal type, but it starts at the cuticle (base of the nail) and slowly spreads toward the nail tip. This type almost always occurs in people with a damaged immune system. It is rare to see debris under the tip of the nail with this condition, unlike distal subungual onychomycosis. The most common cause is T. rubrum and non-dermatophyte molds. Yeast onychomycosis: This type is caused by a yeast called Candida and not by the Trichophyton fungus named above. It is more common in fingernails and is a common cause of fungal fingernails. Patients may have associated paronychia (infection of the cuticle). Candida can cause yellow, brown, white, or thickened nails. Some people who have this infection also have yeast in their mouth or have a chronic paronychia (see above) that is also infected with yeast. White superficial onychomycosis: In this nail condition, a doctor can often scrape off a white powdery material on the top of the nail plate. This condition is most common in tropical environments and is caused by a fungus known and Trichophyton mentagrophytes."
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose fungal nails?,"'Physical exam alone has been shown to be an unreliable method of diagnosing fungal nails. There are many conditions that can make nails look damaged, so even doctors have a difficult time. In fact, studies have found that only about 50% of cases of abnormal nail appearance were caused by fungus. Therefore, laboratory testing is almost always indicated. Some insurance companies may even ask for a laboratory test confirmation of the diagnosis in order for antifungal medicine to be covered. A nail sample is obtained either by clipping the toenail or by drilling a hole in the nail. That piece of nail is sent to a lab where it can by stained, cultured, or tested by ''PCR'' (to identify the genetic material of the organisms) to identify the presence of fungus. Staining and culturing can take up to six weeks to get a result, but PCR to identify the fungal genetic material, if available, can be done in about one day. However, this test is not widely used due to its high cost. If a negative biopsy result is accompanied by high clinical suspicion, such as nails that are ragged, discolored, thickened, and crumbly, it warrants a repeat test due to the prevalence of false-negative results in these tests.''Most of the medications used to treat nail fungus have side effects, so you want to make sure of what you are treating.'  "
What specialists treat nail fungus?,"'There are several doctors who can provide nail fungus treatment. Your primary care provider, a dermatologist, or a podiatrist can treat nail fungus. Any one of these doctors can provide proper diagnosis and prescribe medications specific to fungal infection. A podiatrist or dermatologist may shave the top layer of the nail off or even remove part of the nail.' "
Who should be treated for fungal nails?,'Medical treatment of onychomycosis is suggested in patients who are experiencing ''pain'' and discomfort due to the nail changes. Patients with higher risk factors for infections such as ''diabetes'' and a previous history of ''cellulitis'' (infection of the soft tissue) near the affected nails may also benefit from treatment. Poor cosmetic appearance is another reason for medical treatment.' 
How to get rid of toenail fungus?,"'Keeping nails trimmed and filed can help to reduce the amount of fungus in the nails and is highly recommended. This also provides pain relief when thickened nails cause pressure-related pain.''Creams and other topical medications have traditionally been less effective against nail fungus than oral medications. This is because nails are too hard for external applications to penetrate. It is also cumbersome to adhere to topical medication regimens. Oftentimes, these medications require daily applications for a period of time up to one year to see results. One of the major advantages of topical treatment is the minimal risk for serious side effects and ''drug interactions'' compared to oral therapy.''Prescription topical medications for fungal nails include the following:''Ciclopirox'' (''Penlac'') topical solution 8% is a medical nail lacquer that has been approved to treat finger or toenail fungus that does not involve the white portion of the nail (lunula) in people with normal immune systems. In one study, ciclopirox got rid of the fungus 22% of the time. The medication is applied to affected nails once daily for up to one year. The lacquer must be wiped clean with ''alcohol'' once a week.''Amorolfine topical solution 5%: There is some evidence that using an antifungal nail lacquer containing amorolfine can prevent reinfection after a cure, with a success rate of about 70%. However, this drug is currently unavailable in the United States.''Efinaconazole'' (''Jublia'') is a medication that was approved in 2014. It is a topical (applied to the skin) antifungal used for the local treatment of toenail fungus due to two most common fungal species affecting nails (''Trichophyton rubrum'' and ''Trichophyton mentagrophytes''). Once-daily application is required for 48 weeks. The most common side effects of Jublia are ''ingrown toenails'' and application site ''dermatitis'' and pain.''Tavaborole (Kerydin) is another new medication that is indicated for onychomycosis of the toenails. This medicine has the same indication as efinaconazole. It also requires application once daily for 48 weeks. Common side effects of Kerydin are similar to those of Jublia.'  "
What is the treatment for fungal nails?,"'Oral antifungal therapy has a high cure rate, depending on the medication. It can take nine to 12 months to see if it has worked or not, because that is how long it takes for the nail to grow out. Even when therapy works, the fungus may come back. Currently, an oral antifungal therapy is considered the best treatment for toenail fungus because of higher cure rates and shorter treatment duration compared to topical therapy.''Prescription oral medications that are effective against nail fungus include the following:''There are several innovative treatments that are still being tested:''One way to definitively get rid of toenail fungus is by surgery. Surgical treatment of onychomycosis involves nail removal. However, this often only provides temporary relief, and recurrence is common unless additional antifungal medication (oral or topical) is simultaneously used. However, surgical removal may be warranted when the affected nail is associated with other factors such as trauma and or infection.' Griseofulvin (Fulvicin, Grifulvin, Gris-Peg): This drug has been the mainstay of oral antifungal therapy for many years. Although this drug is safe, it is not very effective against toenail fungus. Disappointing long-term results have been reported. Newer agents have largely supplanted it. Terbinafine (Lamisil): This drug is taken daily for 12 weeks for toenails and six weeks for fingernails. The drug is safe, effective, and produces few side effects. However, it must be used with caution in patients with liver disease. This medication is also affordable. Itraconazole (Sporanox): This is often prescribed in ""pulse doses"" -- one week per month for two or three months. It can interact with some commonly used drugs such as the antibiotic erythromycin or certain asthma medications. It is considered the treatment of choice for onychomycosis caused by Candida yeast and non-dermatophytic molds. Fluconazole (Diflucan): This drug may be given once a week for several months. The dosing of this drug may need to be modified if the patient has impaired kidney function or is taking it simultaneously with certain other medications. It is not as effective as Lamisil or Sporanox and should be used cautiously in patients with liver disease. A doctor will determine whether a simple blood test is needed to check for liver disease. Laser therapy or photodynamic therapy uses application of light-activated agents onto the nail followed by shining light of a proper wavelength on the nail. Use of electrical current to help absorption of topical antifungal medications into the nail: This is also called iontophoresis. Use of a special nail lacquer that changes the micro-climate of the nail to make it inhospitable for the fungus to grow: If this works, it may be an inexpensive way to treat this problem in the future."
Are there home remedies for toenail fungus?,"'The Internet is filled with anecdotal information on how to cure toenail fungus using home remedies. Vinegar is a commonly recommended home remedy. Some people apply various oils such as ''tea tree oil'', coconut oil, essential oils, and oil of cedar leaf (such as Vicks VapoRub) to their nails as well. The effectiveness of these home remedies is highly doubtful. Application of household bleach and hydrogen peroxide is also not recommended due to lack of evidence that these treatments work. These agents can also cause unwanted skin irritation. Thickened nails that have been affected by fungus can be difficult to trim. Using topical urea cream will soften the nail and make it easier to trim. These creams do not require a prescription.' "
Are there over-the-counter treatments for toenail fungus?,"'The definition of ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) products means that they are available by ordinary retail purchase, not requiring a prescription or a license. Although there are few OTC medications aimed to treat fungal nails, many of these medications have not been tested and therefore are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of onychomycosis. Most OTC agents are aimed at treating fungal infection of the skin rather than the nail. Some medications list undecylenic acid and/or propylene glycol as main ingredients. These ingredients inhibit fungal growth; however, they may not adequately penetrate the nail to be effective in treating fungal nails.' "
Are oral medications for nail fungus toxic?,"'The newer drugs are unlikely to cause any liver problems in patients without known liver disease. Blood tests are not needed for once-weekly treatment with fluconazole (Diflucan); however, people taking longer courses often have their ''liver function'' tested before starting the medicine and then retested during the course of treatment. It is important to notify the doctor of all side effects while on the medication. You should tell your doctor of all current medications to prevent potential serious drug interactions.' "
What about the cost of oral medications for fungal nails?,"'A further consideration is cost. Because newer oral antifungal agents are very expensive, some insurance companies balk at paying for what they consider a ""cosmetic issue,"" unless nail fungus causes pain or other functional symptoms. Terbinafine and fluconazole are now available as generic drugs and are quite inexpensive.' "
What is the prognosis of fungal nails?,"'Curing fungal nails can be difficult and treatment can take up to 18 months. Relapse and reinfection are common. Trying to remove or modify your risk factors, if possible, is essential to preventing reinfection. People who have medical illnesses that predispose them to fungal nails can have an even more difficult time eradicating the fungus.' "
Is it possible to prevent the recurrence of nail fungus?,"'Tinea pedis'', also known as '""athlete's foot""' or ''foot fungus'', can cause recurrence of fungal nails. Therefore, it is important to manage this condition. One can apply over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal medicines such as ''clotrimazole'' (Lotrimin) or terbinafine (Lamisil) cream as directed to affected skin. Keeping footwear and socks clean can be helpful. You can also use portable UV light sanitizers to disinfect shoes.' "
Tips for prevention of fungal nails,"'Nail fungus causes only 50% of abnormal-appearing nails. It can be hard to tell the difference between the different causes of discolored nails (even for doctors). Onychomycosis is often not treated. Reasons to receive treatment include''Treatment failures and recurrences are common.''Prevention'' is the key. The following preventive measures may be helpful:' diabetes, previous leg infection (cellulitis), if you have pain or discomfort from your nails, or you would like them treated for cosmetic reasons. Keep your toenails short, and don't dig into the corners of your nails when cutting toenails. Keep feet clean, and dry them thoroughly. Wear dry socks and no tight shoes. Alternate your exercise shoes. Don't soak your hands in water or use harsh cleaners. Treat athlete's foot when it occurs."
Is it possible to prevent fungal nails?,"'No one knows where a specific person catches the fungus, as it is everywhere. However, since the fungus does thrive in warm moist areas (like sweaty feet), there are certain areas one should avoid or use with caution. Shower floors, locker rooms, and swimming pools are suspected of being sources of the fungus, although there are no studies proving this fact. Nail polish and acrylic nails also make the nail less ""breathable"" and make the nail more susceptible to fungal infection. Fungi are everywhere -- in the air, the dust, and the soil. Hygienic measures such as spraying socks and footgear sound sensible, and perhaps these measures can even help a little bit. However, avoiding tight, nonbreathing shoes or steering clear of athletic facility floors may very well be the best prevention available. Daily washing of the feet and drying between the toes can help to prevent nail fungus. The fungi carried on the coats of pets, like cats and ''dogs'"", don't often cause nail fungus. Wearing white socks does not help.""  "
Introduction to lumbar spinal fusion,"'The lumbar spine is the lower portion of the spine found at the center of the curve of the low back, below the rib cage. This area can be a common source of pain. ''Low back pain'' is the second most common reason for visits to the family physician, behind the ''common cold''. As people become older, various changes occur in the lumbar spine that can cause pain. In most cases these changes are due to normal ''degenerative arthritis'' (wear of cartilage over time). The physician must also rule out other more serious conditions including ''tumor'', infection, ''scoliosis'' (curvature of the spine), ''spondylolisthesis'' (slippage of one spinal bone on another), or ''fracture''.''Fortunately, most patients with ''low back pain'' will have improvement in their symptoms regardless of treatment within six weeks. During that time the physician has various treatment options including medications, physical therapy, or injections that can help ease the symptoms. Some of those patients that do not improve after six to 12 weeks may be candidates for surgery. The spine surgeon has different types of surgical options available based on the specific cause of pain. ' "
What is lumbar spinal fusion?,"'Lumbar spinal fusion is an operation that causes the vertebrae (bones of the spine) in the lower back to grow together. The goal of the lumbar fusion is to have the two vertebrae fuse (grow solidly together) so that there is no longer any motion between them. Removing the intervertebral disc (cushion between the bones) or ''bone spurs'' can reduce some of the pressure on the nerves, helping to reduce pain. Additionally, by fusing the two vertebrae together, this may stop the formation of bone spurs at that location, further reducing pain and potential nerve injury. ''There are many different specific techniques to try to fuse the vertebrae together. The surgery can be performed either through an incision in the back, the abdomen, or a combination of both. In many cases metal screws and rods are placed from the back into the bones to hold them in position while the fusion occurs. During an interbody fusion, the surgeon removes the intervertebral disc and places either a bone graft or a metal or ''plastic'' cage, or a combination of these in its place. The decision on what type of fusion is best for each patient is based on their specific complaints and the cause of symptoms. Spinal fusion can be very effective in the properly selected patient.'  "
What is minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'Minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion is similar to traditional lumbar spinal fusion, but it uses smaller incisions and causes less damage to the surrounding tissues during surgery.''As with traditional lumbar spinal fusion, there are many specific techniques available to try to fuse the vertebrae together using minimally invasive techniques. This can be done through the abdomen, from the back, from the side, or with any combination of these.''Minimally invasive lumbar fusion through the abdomen uses four small incisions, approximately ½ inch in length. A ''fiber'' optic viewing camera is used, similar to other minimally invasive procedures including laparoscopic gallbladder or ''appendix'' removal.''Fusion with screws and rods can be performed through the back using several 1-2 inch incisions. In these cases a series of increasingly larger dilators (hollow tubes with solid inserts) are inserted through the incisions to help spread the muscles apart. Once the muscles have been moved away, the screws and rods can be placed through the dilator tubes. In some cases an operating microscope is used to help the surgeon see more clearly.'""One of the most recent advances in minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion is the ability to perform fusion surgery through the patient's side. There are several techniques that allow the surgeon to make a small incision, approximately 2 inches in the patient's side, directly over the planned fusion site. The muscles are then carefully moved aside, and a series of increasing larger dilators are inserted down to the lumbar spine. Specialized instruments can then be used through the dilator tube to remove the intervertebral disc and place a bone graft or metal or plastic spacer in its place. This technique is typically combined with a procedure from the back to place rods and screws for additional support."" "
What are the advantages of minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'The major advantage of all of these minimally invasive techniques is that there is less damage caused to the surrounding tissues. Unfortunately, in traditional spinal surgery it is necessary to cut through muscles and move them out of the way in order to reach the spine. This can cause a large amount of pain following surgery, and it can lengthen the recovery time. Instead of cutting and moving muscles, the minimally invasive techniques can more gently spread through the muscles to allow access to the spine. This is much less painful for the patient, and it does not require as long of a recovery period for the muscle to heal.''Another benefit of less muscle damage is less blood loss and thus a reduced need for blood transfusions using the minimally invasive techniques. There is often less need for narcotic pain medications following this form of surgery, and a shorter hospital stay.' "
What is the disadvantage of minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'As with any new technique, one of the major disadvantages is the additional time needed to perform the procedure. While a surgeon may be very comfortable with the traditional surgical fusion techniques, it will take time to be able to achieve the same outcome using these new methods. Surgeons with more experience can now perform lumbar spinal fusion in equal or even less time than with the traditional techniques.''Not all surgeons perform these techniques, so it may not be available from your current surgeon or in your area. Because this is a relatively new technique, many insurance companies consider this to be an investigational surgery and do not provide insurance coverage for it, so a patient should check with the insurer prior to surgery regarding coverage.'

How effective is minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion?,"'The results for the minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion through the abdomen have not been as good as the traditional open anterior (from the front of the spine) fusion techniques. The success of the fusion has been less reliable, the operative times are longer and there are increased risks of injury to the nerves using the minimally invasive techniques. Because of this, many surgeons have stopped using this technique.''The results of the minimally invasive procedures through the back have been much more promising. Experienced surgeons are able to perform lumbar spinal fusion through the back quicker, with similar fusion rates, less blood loss, and quicker recovery times than using traditional techniques. '""The newer minimally invasive lumbar spinal fusion techniques though the patient's side are still being refined. The initial techniques had some increased risk of damage to nerves, but more recent changes have made these even safer and more effective. The results so far are very promising for this technique, but there have been a limited number of studies. Additionally, since this was only recently developed, there are fewer surgeons performing this technique."" "
Am I a candidate for minimally lumbar invasive spinal fusion?,"'First, you and your doctor need to determine if you are a candidate for spinal fusion. Remember, the majority of patients with ''low back pain'' recover within six weeks regardless of treatment. If you have had prolonged symptoms you should see your physician. If it is decided you may need surgery you will be referred to a spinal surgeon for further evaluation. If a fusion is thought to be potentially beneficial for you, the option of minimally invasive techniques can then be discussed with your surgeon.' "
