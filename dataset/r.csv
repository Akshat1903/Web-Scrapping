Facts you should know about rheumatoid arthritis (RA),"   Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms includejoint pain, such as in the joints of the feet, hands, and knees,swollen joints,fever,limping,loss of range of motion,tender joints,loss of joint function,stiff joints,fatigue,joint redness,rheumatoid nodules,anemia,joint warmth,joint deformity, andsymptoms and signs that affect both sides of the body (symmetry). joint pain, such as in the joints of the feet, hands, and knees, swollen joints, fever, limping, loss of range of motion, tender joints, loss of joint function, stiff joints, fatigue, joint redness, rheumatoid nodules, anemia, joint warmth, joint deformity, and symptoms and signs that affect both sides of the body (symmetry). In rheumatoid arthritis, multiple joints are usually, but not always, affected (polyarthritis) in a symmetrical pattern. Damage to joints can occur early and does not always correlate with the severity of RA symptoms. The ""rheumatoid factor"" is an antibody that can be found in the blood of 80% of people with rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor is detected in a simple blood test. Possible risk factors for developing rheumatoid arthritis include genetic background, smoking, silica inhalation, periodontal disease, and microbes in the bowels (gut bacteria). There is no cure for RA. The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis optimally involves a combination of patient education, rest and exercise, joint protection, medicines, and occasionally surgery. Early RA treatment results in a better prognosis. The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not known. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect people of all ages. NSAIDs, DMARDs, TNF alpha inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, T-cell activation inhibitors, B-cell depleters, JAK inhibitors, immunosuppressants, and steroids treat RA. Researchers have developed medicines that are biosimilar to biologic drugs, and many others are currently under study."
What is rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the joints. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body\'s tissues are mistakenly attacked by their own immune system. The immune system contains a complex organization of cells and antibodies designed normally to ""seek and destroy"" invaders of the body, particularly infections. Patients with autoimmune diseases have antibodies and immune cells in their blood that target their own body tissues, where they can be associated with inflammation. While joint tissue inflammation and inflammatory arthritis are classic RA features, the disease can also cause extra-articular inflammation and injury in other organs.''Because it can affect multiple other organs of the body, rheumatoid arthritis is referred to as a systemic illness and is sometimes called rheumatoid disease.' Rheumatoid arthritis is a classic rheumatic disease. Rheumatoid arthritis that begins in people under 16 years of age is referred to as juvenile idiopathic arthritis or JIA (formerly juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or JRA)."
What are rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and signs?,"'RA symptoms come and go, depending on the degree of tissue inflammation. When body tissues are inflamed, the disease is active. When tissue inflammation subsides, the disease is inactive (in remission). Remissions can occur spontaneously or with treatment and can last weeks, months, or years. During remissions, symptoms of the disease disappear, and people generally feel well. When the disease becomes active again (relapse), symptoms return. The return of disease activity and symptoms is called a flare. The course of rheumatoid arthritis varies among affected individuals, and periods of flares and remissions are typical.''When the disease is active, RA symptoms and signs can include''People with active inflammation of joints from RA can also experience''Muscle and ''joint stiffness'' are usually most notable in the morning and after periods of inactivity. This is referred to as morning stiffness and post-sedentary stiffness. Arthritis is common during disease flares. Also during flares, joints frequently become warm, red, swollen, painful, and tender. This occurs because the lining tissue of the joint (synovium) becomes inflamed, resulting in the production of excessive joint fluid (synovial fluid). The synovium also thickens with inflammation (synovitis).''Rheumatoid arthritis usually inflames multiple joints and affects both sides of the body. In its most common form, therefore, it is referred to as a symmetric polyarthritis.'

   fatigue, loss of energy, lack of appetite, low-grade fever, muscle and joint pain, joint redness, joint swelling, joint tenderness, joint warmth, joint deformity, rheumatoid nodules, stiffness, loss of joint range of motion, loss of joint function, and limping. depression, anemia frustration, and social withdrawal. Early rheumatoid arthritis symptoms may be subtle. The small joints of both the hands and wrists are often involved. Early symptoms of RA can be pain and prolonged stiffness of joints, particularly in the morning. Symptoms in the hands with rheumatoid arthritis include difficulty with simple tasks of daily living, such as turning door knobs and opening jars. The small joints of the feet are also commonly involved, which can lead to painful walking, especially in the morning after arising from bed. Occasionally, only one joint is inflamed. When only one joint is involved, the arthritis can mimic the joint inflammation caused by other forms of arthritis, such as gout or joint infection. Chronic inflammation can cause damage to body tissues, including cartilage and bone. This leads to a loss of cartilage and erosion and weakness of the bones as well as the muscles, resulting in joint deformity, loss of range of motion, destruction, and loss of function. Rarely, rheumatoid arthritis can even affect the joint that is responsible for the tightening of our vocal cords to change the tone of our voice, the cricoarytenoid joint. When this joint is inflamed, it can cause hoarseness of the voice. Symptoms in children with rheumatoid arthritis include limping, irritability, crying, and poor appetite."
Rheumatoid arthritis vs. osteoarthritis,"'Rheumatoid arthritis is a destructive joint disease that is caused by inflammation in the tissue that normally produces lubrication fluid for joints. When this tissue remains inflamed, it leads to deformity by loosening joint ligaments and to joint destruction by eroding away cartilage and bone.''Osteoarthritis'' is a noninflammatory joint disease whereby the cartilage of the joint thins, typically asymmetrically -- so only one knee or hand may be affected. The illustration on the previous page shows the difference between a normal joint and those of ''osteoarthritis'' and rheumatoid arthritis.''While rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic illness, meaning it can last for years, patients may experience long periods without symptoms. However, rheumatoid arthritis is typically a progressive illness that has the potential to cause significant joint destruction and functional disability.''A joint is where two bones meet to allow movement of body parts. Arthritis means joint inflammation. The joint inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis causes swelling, pain, stiffness, and redness in the joints. The inflammation of rheumatoid disease can also occur in tissues around the joints, such as the tendons, ligaments, and muscles.''In some people with rheumatoid arthritis, chronic inflammation leads to the destruction of the cartilage, bone, and ligaments, causing deformity of the joints. Damage to the joints can occur early in the disease and be progressive. Moreover, studies have shown that the progressive damage to the joints does not necessarily correlate with the degree of pain, stiffness, or swelling present in the joints.''Rheumatoid arthritis is a common rheumatic disease, affecting approximately 1.3 million people in the United States, according to current census data. The disease is three times more common in women as in men. It afflicts people of all races equally. The disease can begin at any age and even affects children (''juvenile idiopathic arthritis''), but it most often starts after 40 years of age and before 60 years of age. Though uncommon, in some families, multiple members can be affected, suggesting a genetic basis for the disorder.'

What are rheumatoid arthritis causes and risk factors?,"'The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown. Even though infectious agents such as ''viruses'', bacteria, and fungi have long been suspected, none has been proven as the cause. The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is a very active area of worldwide research. It is believed that the tendency to develop rheumatoid arthritis may be genetically ''inherited'"" (hereditary). Certain genes have been identified that increase the risk for rheumatoid arthritis. It is also suspected that certain infections or factors in the environment might trigger the activation of the immune system in susceptible individuals. This misdirected immune system then attacks the body's own tissues. This leads to inflammation in the joints and sometimes in various organs of the body, such as the ""'lungs'' or eyes.''It is not known what triggers the onset of rheumatoid arthritis. Regardless of the exact trigger, the result is an immune system that is geared up to promote inflammation in the joints and occasionally other tissues of the body. Immune cells, called lymphocytes, are activated and chemical messengers (cytokines, such as ''tumor'' necrosis factor/TNF, interleukin-1/IL-1, and interleukin-6/IL-6) are expressed in the inflamed areas.''Environmental factors also seem to play some role in causing rheumatoid arthritis. For example, scientists have reported that ''smoking'' tobacco, exposure to silica mineral, and chronic periodontal disease all increase the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.''There are theories about gut bacteria (the microbiome of gut microbes that naturally exist in the lining of the bowels) that may trigger the onset of RA in genetically susceptible people. No specific microbes have been identified as definite causes.' "
What are rheumatoid arthritis complications?,"'Since rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease, its inflammation can affect organs and areas of the body other than the joints.' Arthritis-related inflammation of the glands of the eyes and mouth can cause dryness of these areas and is referred to as Sjögren's syndrome. Dryness of the eyes can lead to corneal abrasion. Inflammation of the white parts of the eyes (the sclerae) is referred to as scleritis and can be very dangerous to the eye. Rheumatoid inflammation of the lung lining (pleuritis) causes chest pain with deep breathing, shortness of breath, or coughing. The lung tissue itself can also become inflamed and scarred, and sometimes nodules of inflammation (rheumatoid nodules) develop within the lungs. Inflammation of the tissue (pericardium) surrounding the heart, called pericarditis, can cause a chest pain that typically changes in intensity when lying down or leaning forward. Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with an increased risk for heart attack. Rheumatoid disease can reduce the number of red blood cells (anemia) and white blood cells. Decreased white cells can be associated with an enlarged spleen (referred to as Felty's syndrome) and can increase the risk of infections. The risk of lymph gland cancer (lymphoma) is higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, especially in those with sustained active joint inflammation. Firm lumps or firm bumps under the skin (subcutaneous nodules called rheumatoid nodules) can occur around the elbows and fingers where there is frequent pressure. Even though these nodules usually do not cause symptoms, occasionally they can become infected. Nerves can become pinched in the wrists to cause carpal tunnel syndrome. A rare, serious complication, usually with longstanding rheumatoid disease, is blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis). Vasculitis can impair blood supply to tissues and lead to tissue death (necrosis). This is most often initially visible as tiny black areas around the nail beds or as leg ulcers."
What tests do physicians use to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis?,"'There is no singular test for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis. The diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation. Ultimately, rheumatoid arthritis is diagnosed based on a combination of the following:''Understand that many forms of joint disease mimic rheumatoid arthritis.'   Presentation of the joints involved Characteristic joint swelling and stiffness in the morning The presence of blood rheumatoid factor (RF blood test or RA test) and citrulline antibody The presence of rheumatoid nodules and radiographic changes (X-ray testing) The first step in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is a meeting between the doctor and the patient. The doctor reviews the history of symptoms. Then the doctor checks the joints for inflammation, tenderness, swelling, and deformity and looks for rheumatoid skin nodules. Rheumatoid nodules are firm lumps or bumps under the skin, most commonly over the elbows or fingers). The doctor will also check other parts of the body for inflammation. Certain blood and X-ray tests are often obtained. The diagnosis will be based on the pattern of symptoms, the distribution of the inflamed joints, and the blood and X-ray findings. Several visits may be necessary before the doctor can be certain of the diagnosis. A doctor with special training in arthritis and related diseases is called a rheumatologist. Joint inflammation helps to distinguish rheumatoid arthritis from common types of arthritis that are not inflammatory, such as osteoarthritis or degenerative arthritis. The distribution of joint inflammation is also important to the doctor in making a diagnosis. In rheumatoid arthritis, the small joints of the hands and fingers, wrists, feet, and knees are typically inflamed in a symmetrical distribution (affecting both sides of the body). When only one or two joints are inflamed, the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis becomes more difficult. The doctor may then perform other tests to exclude arthritis due to infection or gout. The detection of rheumatoid nodules (described above), most often around the elbows and fingers, can suggest the diagnosis. Abnormal antibodies can be found in the blood of people with rheumatoid arthritis with simple blood testing. An antibody called ""rheumatoid factor"" (RF) can be found in 80% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatoid factor are referred to as having ""seropositive rheumatoid arthritis."" Patients who are felt to have rheumatoid arthritis and do not have positive rheumatoid factor testing are referred to as having ""seronegative rheumatoid arthritis."" Citrulline antibody (also referred to as anti-citrulline antibody, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and anti-CCP antibody) is present in 50%-75% people with rheumatoid arthritis. It is useful in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis when evaluating cases of unexplained joint inflammation. A test for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies helps in looking for the cause of previously undiagnosed inflammatory arthritis when rheumatoid factor is not present. Citrulline antibodies have been felt to represent the earlier stages of rheumatoid arthritis in this setting. Citrulline antibodies also have been associated with more aggressive forms of rheumatoid arthritis. Another antibody called the ""antinuclear antibody"" (ANA) is also frequently found in people with rheumatoid arthritis. It should be noted that many forms of arthritis in childhood (juvenile inflammatory arthritis) are not associated with blood test positivity for rheumatoid factors. In this setting, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis must be distinguished from other types of joint inflammation. These include plant thorn arthritis, joint injury, arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease, and rarely joint tumors. A blood test called the sedimentation rate (sed rate) is a crude measure of the inflammation of the joints. The sed rate actually measures how fast red blood cells fall to the bottom of a test tube. The sed rate is usually faster (high) during disease flares and slower (low) during remissions. Another blood test that is used to measure the degree of inflammation present in the body is the C-reactive protein. Blood testing may also reveal anemia, since anemia is common in rheumatoid arthritis, particularly because of the chronic inflammation. The rheumatoid factor, ANA, sed rate, and C-reactive protein tests can also be abnormal in other systemic autoimmune and inflammatory medical conditions. Therefore, abnormalities in these blood tests alone are not sufficient for a firm diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Joint X-rays may be normal or only show swelling of soft tissues early in the disease. As the disease progresses, X-rays can reveal bony erosions typical of rheumatoid arthritis in the joints. Joint X-rays can also be helpful in monitoring the progression of disease and joint damage over time. Bone scanning, a procedure using a small amount of a radioactive substance, can also be used to show the inflamed joints. MRI scanning can also be used to show joint damage. The doctor may elect to perform an office procedure called arthrocentesis. In this procedure, a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain joint fluid out of the joint for study in the laboratory. Analysis of the joint fluid in the laboratory can help to exclude other causes of arthritis, such as infection and gout. Arthrocentesis can also be helpful in relieving joint swelling and pain. Occasionally, cortisone medicines are injected into the joint during the arthrocentesis in order to rapidly relieve joint inflammation and further reduce symptoms."
What are the 4 stages of rheumatoid arthritis?,"'The American College of ''Rheumatology'' has developed a system for classifying rheumatoid arthritis that is primarily based upon the X-ray appearance of the joints. This system helps medical professionals classify the severity of your rheumatoid arthritis with respect to cartilage, ligaments, and bone.''Stage I (early RA)''Stage II (moderate progressive)''Stage III (severe progression)''Stage IV (terminal progression)''Rheumatologists'' also classify the functional status of people with rheumatoid arthritis as follows:' No damage seen on X-rays, although there may be signs of bone thinning On X-ray, evidence of bone thinning around a joint with or without slight bone damage Slight cartilage damage possible Joint mobility may be limited; no joint deformities observed Atrophy of adjacent muscle Abnormalities of soft tissue around joint possible On X-ray, evidence of cartilage and bone damage and bone thinning around the joint Joint deformity without permanent stiffening or fixation of the joint Extensive muscle atrophy Abnormalities of soft tissue around joint possible On X-ray, evidence of cartilage and bone damage and osteoporosis around joint Joint deformity with permanent fixation of the joint (referred to as ankylosis) Extensive muscle atrophy Abnormalities of soft tissue around joint possible Class I: completely able to perform usual activities of daily living Class II: able to perform usual self-care and work activities but limited in activities outside of work (such as playing sports, household chores) Class III: able to perform usual self-care activities but limited in work and other activities Class IV: limited in ability to perform usual self-care, work, and other activities"
What are rheumatoid arthritis treatment options?," There is no known cure for rheumatoid arthritis. To date, the goal of treatment in rheumatoid arthritis is to reduce joint inflammation and pain, maximize joint function, and prevent joint destruction and deformity. Early medical intervention has been shown to be important in improving outcomes. Aggressive management can improve function, stop damage to joints as monitored on X-rays, and prevent work disability. Optimal RA treatment involves a combination of medicines, rest, joint-strengthening exercises, joint protection, and patient (and family) education. Treatment is customized according to many factors such as disease activity, types of joints involved, general health, age, and patient occupation. RA treatment is most successful when there is close cooperation between the doctor, patient, and family members."
What are types of rheumatoid arthritis medicines?,"'Two classes of medicines are used in treating rheumatoid arthritis: fast-acting ""first-line drugs"" and slow-acting ""second-line drugs"" (also referred to as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or DMARDs).''The degree of destructiveness of RA varies among affected individuals. Those with less destructive RA or disease that has quieted after many active years can manage their RA with rest plus pain control and anti-inflammatory drugs. Early treatment with second-line drugs (DMARD) improves function and minimizes disability and joint destruction, even within months of the diagnosis. Most people require more aggressive second-line drugs, such as methotrexate, in addition to anti-inflammatory agents. Sometimes these second-line drugs are used in combination.'   The first-line drugs, such as aspirin and cortisone (corticosteroids [Rayos, Celestone, Depo-Medrol, Kenalog]), are used to reduce pain and inflammation. The slow-acting second-line drugs, such as methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall, Otrexup, Rasuvo) and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), promote disease remission and prevent progressive joint destruction. The areas of the body other than the joints that are affected by rheumatoid inflammation are treated individually. Sjögren's syndrome can be helped by artificial tears and humidifying rooms in the home or office. Medicated eyedrops, cyclosporine ophthalmic drops (Restasis), are also available to help the dry eyes in those affected. Regular eye checkups and early antibiotic treatment for infection of the eyes are important. Inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis), bursae (bursitis), and rheumatoid nodules can be injected with cortisone. Inflammation of the lining of the heart and/or lungs may require high doses of oral cortisone. In some cases with severe joint deformity, surgery may be recommended to restore joint mobility or repair damaged joints. Doctors who specialize in joint surgery are orthopedic surgeons. The types of joint surgery range from arthroscopy to partial and complete replacement of the joint. Arthroscopy is a surgical technique whereby a doctor inserts a tube-like instrument into the joint to see and repair abnormal tissues. Total joint replacement is a surgical procedure whereby a destroyed joint is replaced with artificial materials. For example, the small joints of the hand can be replaced with plastic material. Large joints, such as the hips or knees, are replaced with metals."
"""First-line"" rheumatoid arthritis medicines","'Acetylsalicylate (aspirin), ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn''), ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', Medipren, ''Motrin''), ''etodolac'' (Lodine), and ''diclofenac'' (''Voltaren'') are examples of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs are medicines that can reduce tissue inflammation, pain, and swelling. NSAIDs are not cortisone. Aspirin, in doses higher than those used in treating ''headaches'"" and fever, is an effective anti-inflammatory medication for rheumatoid arthritis. Aspirin has been used for joint problems since the ancient Egyptian era. The newer NSAIDs are just as effective as aspirin in reducing inflammation and pain and require fewer dosages per day. Patients' responses to different ""'NSAID'' medicines vary. Therefore, it is not unusual for a medical professional to try several NSAID drugs in order to identify the most effective agent with the fewest side effects. The most common side effects of aspirin and other NSAIDs include stomach upset, ''abdominal pain'', ulcers, and even gastrointestinal bleeding. In order to reduce gastrointestinal side effects, NSAIDs are usually taken with food. Additional medicines are frequently recommended to protect the stomach from the ulcer effects of NSAIDs. These medicines include antacids, ''sucralfate'' (''Carafate''), proton-pump inhibitors (''Prevacid'' and others), and ''misoprostol'' (''Cytotec''). Newer NSAIDs include selective ''Cox-2 inhibitors'', such as ''celecoxib'' (''Celebrex''), which offer anti-inflammatory effects with less risk of stomach irritation and bleeding risk.''Corticosteroid'' medicines can be given orally or injected directly into joints (intra-articular injections) and tissues. They are more potent than NSAIDs in reducing inflammation and in restoring joint mobility and function. Corticosteroids are useful for short periods during severe flares of disease activity or when the disease is not responding to NSAIDs. However, corticosteroids can have serious side effects, especially when given in high doses for long periods of time. These side effects include ''weight gain'', facial puffiness, thinning of the skin and bone, ''easy bruising'', ''cataracts'', risk of infection, muscle wasting, and destruction of large joints, such as the hips. Corticosteroids also carry some increased risk of contracting infections. These side effects can be partially avoided by gradually tapering the doses of corticosteroids as the patient achieves improvement in symptoms. Abruptly discontinuing corticosteroids can lead to flares of the disease or other symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal and is discouraged. Thinning of the bones due to ''osteoporosis'' may be prevented by calcium and ''vitamin D'' ''supplements''.' "
"""Second-line"" or ""slow-acting"" rheumatoid arthritis drugs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or DMARDs)","'While ""first-line"" medicines (NSAIDs and corticosteroids) can relieve joint inflammation and pain, they do not necessarily prevent joint destruction or deformity. Rheumatoid arthritis requires medicines other than NSAIDs and corticosteroids to stop progressive damage to cartilage, bone, and adjacent soft tissues. The RA medicines needed for ideal management of the disease are also referred to as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or DMARDs. They come in a variety of forms and are listed below. These ""second-line"" or ""slow-acting"" medicines may take weeks to months to become effective. They are used for long periods, even years, at varying doses. If maximally effective, DMARDs can promote remission, thereby retarding the progression of joint destruction and deformity. Sometimes a number of DMARD second-line medicines are used together as combination therapy. As with the first-line medicines, the doctor may need to try different second-line medicines before treatment is optimal.''Research suggests that patients who respond to a DMARD with control of the rheumatoid disease may lower the known risk of lymphoma that exists from simply having RA. The various available DMARDs are reviewed next.''Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) is related to quinine and has also been used in the treatment of ''malaria''. It is used over long periods for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Possible side effects include ''upset stomach'', skin ''rashes'', muscle weakness, and vision changes. Even though vision changes are rare, people taking Plaquenil should be monitored by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist).''Sulfasalazine'' (Azulfidine) is an oral medication traditionally used in the treatment of mild to moderately severe ''inflammatory bowel diseases'', such as ''ulcerative colitis'"" and Crohn's ""'colitis''. Azulfidine is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in combination with anti-inflammatory medicines. Azulfidine is generally well tolerated. Common side effects include ''rash'' and ''upset stomach''. Because Azulfidine is made up of sulfa and salicylate compounds, it should be avoided by people with known sulfa ''allergies''.''Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall, Otrexup, Rasuvo) has gained popularity among doctors as an initial second-line drug because of its effectiveness and infrequent side effects. It also has an advantage in dose flexibility (dosages can be adjusted according to needs). Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug. It can affect the bone marrow and the ''liver'', even rarely causing ''cirrhosis''. All people taking methotrexate require regular blood tests to monitor blood counts and ''liver function''. Taking ''folic acid'' as a supplement can reduce the risk of methotrexate side effects.''Gold salts have been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis throughout most of the past century. Gold thioglucose (Solganal) and gold thiomalate (''Myochrysine'') are given by injection, initially on a weekly basis, for months to years. Oral gold, ''auranofin'' (''Ridaura''), was introduced in the 1980s. Side effects of gold (oral and injectable) include skin ''rash'', ''mouth sores'', kidney damage with leakage of ''protein in the urine'', and bone marrow damage with anemia and low white cell count. Those receiving gold treatment are regularly monitored with blood and urine tests. Oral gold can cause ''diarrhea''. These gold drugs have lost favor in the treatment of RA because of the availability of more effective treatments, particularly methotrexate.''D-''penicillamine'' (''Depen'', ''Cuprimine'') can be helpful in selected cases of progressive forms of rheumatoid arthritis. Side effects are similar to those of gold. They include fever, ''chills'', ''mouth sores'', a ''metallic taste in the mouth'', skin rash, kidney and bone marrow damage, stomach upset, and ''easy bruising''. People taking this medication require routine blood and urine tests. D-penicillamine can rarely cause symptoms of other autoimmune diseases and is no longer commonly used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.'""Immunosuppressive medicines are powerful medicines that suppress the body's immune system. A number of immunosuppressive drugs are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. They include methotrexate as described above, ""'azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), ''chlorambucil'' (''low platelet count''Immunosuppressive medicines can depress bone marrow function and cause anemia, a low white cell count, and low platelet counts. A low white count can increase the risk of infections, while a low ''platelet count'' can increase the risk of bleeding. Methotrexate rarely can lead to liver ''cirrhosis'', as described above, and ''allergic'' reactions in the lung. Cyclosporine can cause kidney damage and ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''). Because of potentially serious side effects, immunosuppressive medicines are used in low doses, usually in combination with anti-inflammatory agents.''Researchers have shown that combinations of traditional DMARDs, including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and hydroxychloroquine, are another potent method of stopping the progression of RA.' "
What are newer rheumatoid arthritis medications and side effects?,"'Newer ""second-line"" drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis include the following:''Each of these medicines can increase the risk for infections, and the development of any infections should be reported to the doctor when taking these newer second-line drugs.''While biologic drugs are often combined with DMARDs in the treatment of RA, they are generally not used with other biologics due to the risk of serious infections. Similarly, JAK inhibitor medication is not used with traditional biologic medicines.'

It seems to work by blocking the action of an important enzyme that has a role in immune activation. Leflunomide can cause liver disease, diarrhea, hair loss, and/or rash in some people. It should not be taken just before or during pregnancy because of possible birth defects and is generally avoided in women who might become pregnant. Biologic DMARDs represent a novel approach to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and are products of modern biotechnology. These are referred to as the biologic agents or biological response modifiers. In comparison with traditional DMARDs, the biologic medications have a much more rapid onset of action and can have powerful effects on stopping progressive joint damage. In general, their methods of action are also more directed, defined, and targeted. Etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol are biologic drugs that intercept tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the joints; TNF promotes joint inflammation in RA. These TNF-blockers intercept TNF before it can act on its natural receptor to ""switch on"" the process of inflammation. This effectively blocks the TNF inflammation messenger from recruiting the cells of inflammation. Symptoms can be significantly, and often rapidly, improved in those using these drugs. Etanercept must be injected subcutaneously once or twice a week. Infliximab is given by infusion directly into a vein (intravenously). Adalimumab is injected subcutaneously either every other week or weekly. Golimumab is injected subcutaneously on a monthly basis. Certolizumab pegol is injected subcutaneously every two to four weeks. Each of these medicines is being evaluated by health care professionals in practice to determine what role they may have in treating patients in various stages of rheumatoid arthritis. Research has shown that biological response modifiers also prevent the progressive joint destruction of rheumatoid arthritis. They are currently recommended for use after other second-line medicines have not been effective. The biological response modifiers (TNF-inhibitors) are expensive treatments. They are also frequently used in combination with methotrexate and other DMARDs. Furthermore, it should be noted that the TNF-blocking biologics all are more effective when combined with methotrexate. People with significant congestive heart failure or demyelinating diseases (such as multiple sclerosis) should avoid these medicines because they can worsen these medical conditions. Biosimilar TNF-blockers include etanercept-szzs (Erelzi), adalimumab-atto (Amjevita), infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra), and infliximab-abda (Renflexis). Anakinra (Kineret) is another biologic DMARD treatment that is used to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Anakinra works by binding to a cell messenger protein (IL-1, a pro-inflammatory cytokine). Anakinra is injected under the skin daily. Anakinra can be used alone or with other DMARDs. The response rate of anakinra does not seem to be as high as with other biologic medicines. Rituximab (Rituxan) is an antibody that was first used to treat lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes. Rituximab can be effective in treating autoimmune diseases like RA because it depletes B-cells. These are important cells of inflammation that produce abnormal antibodies that are common in these medical conditions. Rituximab is used to treat moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have failed treatment with the TNF-blocking biologics. Preliminary studies have shown that Rituximab was also found to be beneficial in treating severe rheumatoid arthritis complicated by blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis) and cryoglobulinemia. Rituximab is an intravenous infusion given in two doses, two weeks apart, approximately every six months. Biosimilar versions of rituximab are under study. Abatacept (Orencia) is a biologic medication that blocks T-cell activation. Abatacept is used to treat adult patients who have failed treatment with a traditional DMARD medication. Abatacept is an intravenous infusion given monthly or a weekly subcutaneous injection. Tocilizumab (Actemra) and sarilumab (Kevzara) can treat adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had a poor response to one or more DMARD. Tocilizumab is the first approved biologic medication that blocks interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is a chemical messenger of the inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab is an intravenous infusion given monthly or a weekly subcutaneous injection. Sarilumab also blocks IL-6. Tofacitinib (Xeljanz) is the first in a new class of medicines used to treat rheumatoid arthritis called JAK inhibitors. Tofacitinib and baricitinib (Olumiant) treat adults with moderately to severely active RA in which methotrexate did not work well and who have failed a TNF-blocker biologic. Tofacitinib can be used with or without methotrexate. This prescription medicine is taken by mouth once or twice daily. Baricitinib (Olumiant) is also an oral medication taken once daily. Tofacitinib and baricitinib are ""targeted"" medicines that specifically block special enzymes of inflammation in joints (called Janus kinase) within cells. For this reason, medical professionals call tofacitinib and baricitinib JAK inhibitors."

One hundred years ago, it was touted that ""night-shade"" foods, such as tomatoes, would aggravate rheumatoid arthritis. This is no longer accepted as true. There are no specific foods or food groups that should be universally avoided by individuals with rheumatoid arthritis.''There is no evidence that ''gluten'' bothers rheumatoid arthritis. Nevertheless, for those who are definitely sensitive to gluten (wheat, barley, and rye), the ''gluten-free diet'' can prevent poor intestinal absorption of important nutrients. Bowel inflammation can be detrimental for those with RA if they become deficient in nutrients, such as ''vitamin D'' and folate.''Nevertheless, some home remedies may be helpful, although these are not considered as potent or effective as disease-modifying drugs. Fish oils, such as in salmon, and ''omega-3 fatty acids'' ''supplements'' have been shown to be beneficial in some short-term studies in rheumatoid arthritis. This suggests that there may be benefits by adding more fish to the diet, such as in the popular ''Mediterranean diet''. The anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin in dietary turmeric, an ingredient in curry, may be beneficial in reducing ''symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis''.''Supplements such as calcium and ''vitamin D'' are used to prevent ''osteoporosis'' in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Folic acid is used as a supplement to prevent side effects of methotrexate treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. ''Alcohol'' is minimized or avoided in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking methotrexate.''The benefits of cartilage preparations such as ''glucosamine'' and chondroitin for rheumatoid arthritis remain unproven. Symptomatic pain relief can often be achieved with oral ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''over-the-counter'' topical preparations, which are rubbed into the skin. Antibiotics, in particular the ''tetracycline'' drug ''minocycline'' (''Minocin''), have been tried for rheumatoid arthritis recently in ''clinical trials''. Early results have shown mild to moderate improvement in the symptoms of arthritis. Minocycline has been shown to impede important mediator enzymes of tissue destruction, called metalloproteinases, in the laboratory as well as in humans.'""Impact loading joints can aggravate inflamed, active RA; it's also difficult when joints have been injured in the past by the disease. So, it is important to customize activities and ""'exercise'"" programs according to each individual's capacity. Physical therapy can be helpful. Exercises that are less traumatic for the joints, including ""'yoga'' and ''tai chi'', can be beneficial in maintaining flexibility and strength. They also lead to an improved general sense of well-being.''Proper regular exercise is important in maintaining joint mobility and in strengthening the muscles around the joints. ''Swimming'' is particularly helpful because it allows exercise with minimal ''stress'' on the joints. Physical and occupational therapists are trained to provide specific exercise instructions and can offer splinting supports. For example, wrist and finger splints can be helpful in reducing inflammation and maintaining joint alignment. Devices such as canes, toilet seat raisers, and jar grippers can assist in the activities of daily living. Heat and ''cold'' applications are modalities that can ease symptoms before and after exercise.'  "
What about rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy?,"'In general, rheumatoid arthritis often improves during pregnancy. It is commonplace for the rheumatoid joint inflammation to decrease and be minimized during pregnancy. Unfortunately, this reduction of joint inflammation during pregnancy is not usually sustained after delivery.' Do not use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve) and others, during pregnancy. Women should not use methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) or cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune) during pregnancy. They must discontinue their use well in advance of conception due to potential risks to the fetus. Biologic medicines are avoided during pregnancy when possible. When rheumatoid arthritis is active during pregnancy, steroid medications such as prednisone and prednisolone are often used to quiet the joint inflammation. These medicines do not adversely affect the fetus."
What is the prognosis for rheumatoid arthritis patients?,"   With early, aggressive treatment, the outlook for those affected by rheumatoid arthritis can be very good. The overall attitude regarding ability to control the disease has changed tremendously since the turn of the century. Doctors now strive to eradicate any signs of active disease while preventing flare-ups. The disease can be controlled and a cooperative effort by the doctor and patient can lead to optimal health. Rheumatoid arthritis causes disability and can increase mortality and decrease life expectancy to lead to an early death. Patients have a less favorable outlook when they have deformity, disability, ongoing uncontrolled joint inflammation, and/or rheumatoid disease affecting other organs of the body. Overall, rheumatoid arthritis tends to be potentially more damaging when rheumatoid factor or citrulline antibody is shown by blood testing. Life expectancy improves with earlier treatment and monitoring. Finally, minimizing emotional stress can help improve the overall health in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Support and extracurricular groups provide those with rheumatoid arthritis time to discuss their problems with others and learn more about their illness."
What are tips for living with rheumatoid arthritis?," Early and aggressive treatment tends to result in optimal outcome. Understand how your rheumatoid arthritis, as well as the effects and side effects of its treatment, will be monitored. Maintain a working relationship with your treating doctor. Consider consulting with a rheumatologist. Have a game plan for addressing flare-ups of the rheumatoid inflammation. Preplan your treatment options for travel with your doctor. Review with your doctor any concerns about your rheumatoid arthritis, its influence on your lifestyle activities, your avocations, and your long-term life goals."
What specialists treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?," The primary specialist for diagnosing, managing, and monitoring rheumatoid arthritis is a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist works together with the primary doctor and other specialists to maximize health outcomes and minimize comorbid health conditions. Other specialists involved in the care of RA patients include the following:physiatristsdermatologistspulmonologistscardiologistsnephrologistsradiologistsneurologistsendocrinologistsorthopedistsgeneral surgeons physiatrists dermatologists pulmonologists cardiologists nephrologists radiologists neurologists endocrinologists orthopedists general surgeons Ancillary health care providers who can be involved in the care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis include physical therapists, occupational therapists, and massage therapists."
Is there a cure for RA?,"'No, rheumatoid arthritis is not a curable disease at this time. As the science of genetics and disease as well as autoimmunity evolve, it is very likely that cures for rheumatoid arthritis will become available.' "
Is it possible to prevent rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Currently, there is no specific ''prevention'' of rheumatoid arthritis. Because ''cigarette smoking'', exposure to silica mineral, and chronic periodontal disease all increase the risk for rheumatoid arthritis, these conditions should be avoided.' "
Are there support groups for people with rheumatoid arthritis?,"'There are support groups for rheumatoid arthritis in all major cities in the United States. Many are affiliated with local hospitals and/or local chapters of the Arthritis Foundation.''The Arthritis Foundation''P.O. Box 19000''Atlanta, Georgia 30326' "
Where can people get additional information on rheumatoid arthritis?,"'From the 2015 national meeting of the American College of Rheumatology:''For more information about rheumatoid arthritis as well as living with RA and for support groups, please consider the following:''Box AMS''Bethesda, Maryland 20892''301-495-4484' There are many new biologic treatments for rheumatoid arthritis on the near horizon. Many of these are being studied with and without simultaneous methotrexate. Some block chemical messengers and some block specific cell types of inflammation. The significant benefit of treating lipid/cholesterol profiles in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to improve long-term risks of stroke and heart attack was emphasized. Diets higher in fish, grains, and vegetables decrease the risk of developing RA. The Western diet, defined as including more processed meats, increases the risk. It is not certain whether this is because of a direct anti-inflammatory effect of the fish, grains, and vegetables or because of changes in the natural bacteria in the gut. National Institute of arthritis https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/rheumatoid-arthritis National Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Clearinghouse"
What research is being done on rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Scientists throughout the world are studying many promising areas of new treatment approaches for rheumatoid arthritis. Indeed, treatment guidelines are evolving with the availability of newer treatments. These areas include treatments that block the action of the special inflammation factors, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha), B-cell and T-cell function, as well as interleukin-1 (IL-1). Many other drugs are being developed that act against certain critical white blood cells and chemical messengers involved in rheumatoid inflammation. Also, new NSAIDs with mechanisms of action that are different from current drugs are on the horizon. Further biosimilar versions of the biologic medicines, including rituximab, are under study.''Better methods of more accurately defining which patients are more likely to develop more aggressive disease are becoming available. Recent antibody research found that the presence of citrulline antibodies in the blood is associated with a greater tendency toward more destructive RA forms.''Studies involving various types of the connective tissue collagen are in progress and show encouraging signs of reducing rheumatoid disease activity. Finally, genetic research and engineering are likely to bring forth many new avenues for earlier diagnosis and accurate treatment in the near future. Gene profiling, also known as gene array analysis, is being identified as a helpful method of defining which people will respond to which medicines. Studies are under way that are using gene array analysis to determine which patients will be at more risk for more aggressive disease. This is all occurring because of improvements in technology. We are at the threshold of tremendous improvements in the management of rheumatoid arthritis.' "
What is rabies?,'Rabies is a viral illness spread via the saliva of an infected animal by the rabies virus (genus ''Lyssavirus''). Rabies exposure occurs usually through biting a human or another infected animal. Transmission can also occur through saliva touching an ''open wound'' or touching mucous membranes.' 
What causes rabies? What is the incubation period for rabies?,"'The rabies virus causes rabies. The virus infects the brain and ultimately leads to death. After a rabid animal bites someone, the virus is deposited in the muscle and subcutaneous tissue. For most of the incubation period (which is usually one to three months), the virus stays close to the exposure site. The virus then travels via peripheral nerves to the brain and from there, again via peripheral nerves, to nearly all parts of the body.''Any warm-blooded animal can spread rabies. In the United States, the saliva of rabid bats, coyotes, foxes, raccoons, and skunks most often transmits rabies. In the developing world, stray ''dogs'' are the most likely animal to transmit rabies. The virus has also been found in cows, cats, ferrets, and horses.''The local health department will usually have information on which other animals in your area have been found to carry the rabies virus.' "
What are risk factors for rabies?,"""Any activity that brings someone in contact with possible rabid animals, such as traveling in an area where rabies is more common (Africa and Southeast Asia) as well as outdoor activities near bats and other possible rabid animals, increases one's risk of getting infected with rabies."" "
What are rabies symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of human rabies can occur as fast as within the first week of the infection.''The early symptoms of rabies are very generalized and include ''weakness'', ''fever'', and ''headaches''. Without a history of a potential exposure to a rabid animal, these symptoms would not raise the suspicion of rabies as they are very similar to the common ''flu'' or other viral syndromes.''The disease can then take two forms:''Once the clinical signs of rabies occur, the disease is nearly always fatal.'""In the U.S., there is one reported case of a patient surviving rabies without vaccination (Jeanna Giese), which led to the development of the so-called Milwaukee treatment protocol. Physicians don't recommend this protocol as a treatment alternative.""   With paralytic rabies (approximately 20% of cases), the patient's muscles slowly become paralyzed (usually starting at the site of the bite). This is the less common form and ends in coma and death. With furious rabies (about 80% of cases), the patient exhibits the classic symptoms of rabies, such asanxiety and confusion (The patient is often overly active.);encephalitis, causing hallucinations, confusion, and coma;hypersalivation;hydrophobia (fear and avoidance of water);aerophobia (fear of fresh air);difficulty swallowing. anxiety and confusion (The patient is often overly active.); encephalitis, causing hallucinations, confusion, and coma; hypersalivation; hydrophobia (fear and avoidance of water); aerophobia (fear of fresh air); difficulty swallowing."
How do physicians diagnose rabies?,"'In animals, health care professionals diagnose rabies by detecting the rabies virus in any affected part of the brain. This requires euthanization of the rabid animal. Testing a suspected animal will help avoid extensive testing in the human contact (if the test is negative) and unnecessary treatments.''In humans, health care professionals diagnose rabies by testing saliva, blood samples, spinal fluid, and skin samples. Multiple tests may be necessary. The tests rely on detection of proteins on the surface of the rabies virus, detection of the genetic material of the virus, or demonstration of an antibody (immune) response to the virus.' "
What is the treatment for rabies?,"'Medical care is recommended if a health care professional thinks that someone was exposed to a potentially rabid animal.'""If the animal is a pet or farm animal that has no symptoms, the animal can be isolated and observed for 10 days. Wild animals that can be captured can be killed and tested for the virus. If the animal can't be found, it is best to consult with the health department.""'The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends prophylaxis (protective treatment) after a wildlife bite from an animal suspected to have rabies.''The general pathway to determine post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies requires the following information:''As rabies is a fatal disease, if it is suspected, it is often best to start treatment until further information is available.''A health care professional administers a series of injections. The first is a rabies immune globulin (human rabies immune globulin [HRIG]), which health care professionals only give to previously unvaccinated individuals, as well as the rabies ''vaccine''. Those who have been previously vaccinated or are already receiving pre-exposure vaccination should only receive the vaccine. Over the next 2 weeks, health care professionals administer three additional rabies vaccine injections during follow-up visits on days 3, 7, and 14. Health care professionals give the first of these ''vaccines'' as soon as possible after exposure. Doctors give these rabies vaccinations as intramuscular injections, and the ''vaccines'' help the body fight the virus.''The treatment regimen for previously vaccinated individuals is different, with no HRIG given and only two doses of the rabies vaccine.'   Bite: Did a bite occur, and where is the location of the bite? (Any penetration of the skin is considered a bite; although bites to the face and hands carry the highest risk, all bites need to be considered for prophylaxis.) Non-bite incident: Did the saliva touch an open wound or a mucous membrane? Animal risk factors: No cases of rabies infection have been reported in the U.S. from fully vaccinated domestic animals (dogs or cats). If bitten, it is important to determine if the bite was provoked or unprovoked. A provoked bite includes any circumstances during which the person touched, threatened, scared, fed, or otherwise interacted with the animal prior to the bite. If no such interaction occurred, the bite is considered unprovoked, and it increases the likelihood that the animal may have rabies. Bats: A health care professional should evaluate any contact with a bat that leads to a potential scratch, bite, or mucous membrane exposure to saliva. If prolonged exposure to a bat is discovered (sleeping in a room where a bat is found), postexposure prophylaxis needs to be considered."
What is the prognosis of rabies?,"'Once the symptoms of rabies start, the disease is nearly universally fatal.' "
Is it possible to prevent rabies? Is there a rabies vaccine?,"""Rabies prevention is mostly about good pet care and outdoor behavior. Vaccinate pets and keep them away from outdoor and wild animals. Don't approach wild animals. Keep bats out of the home, and stay away from areas with bats (caves).""'About 5,000 cases of animal rabies are reported annually to the CDC, with most of these cases occurring in wildlife.''When traveling, be aware of stray animals.''If spending significant time in a country where rabies is common, one should consider rabies vaccination.' "
What is a lumbar puncture (LP)?,"'A lumbar puncture (LP) is the insertion of a needle into the spinal canal to collect and examine the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (cerebral spinal fluid). It is termed a ""lumbar puncture"" because the needle is placed in the lumbar portion of the back and used to puncture through tissues to enter the spinal canal.''Other names for a lumbar puncture (an LP) include spinal tap, spinal puncture, thecal puncture, and rachiocentesis.' "
Why is a lumbar puncture done?,"'An LP is most commonly performed to obtain a sample of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Examination of the fluid can be crucial in diagnosing diseases such as meningitis, neurologic diseases, or effects of systemic disease on the brain and spinal fluid. An LP can also be done to treat diseases, and as a way of administering antibiotics, ''cancer'' ''drugs'', or anesthetic agents into the spinal canal. Spinal fluid is sometimes removed by LP for the purpose of decreasing spinal fluid pressure in patients with uncommon conditions (such as, normal-pressure ''hydrocephalus'' and ''benign intracranial hypertension'', for example).''Sometimes a lumbar puncture is performed in patients with ''migraines'' to assure that no other underlying pathology exists.'  "
How is the LP procedure performed?,"'Patients typically lie on their side for the procedure. Less often, the procedure is performed while the patient is sitting up and leaning slightly forward.''After local anesthesia is injected into the lumbar area of the back, a long needle is inserted in between the bones of the spine (vertebrae) into the spinal canal. (The needle is most commonly placed between the third and fourth ''lumbar vertebrae''.)''Spinal fluid pressure can then be measured and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removed for testing.' "
What is the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)?,"'The CSF circulates around the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). This ""water bath"" acts as a support of buoyancy for the brain and spinal cord. The support of the CSF helps to protect the brain from injury.''The normal CSF appears clear and contains various substances, such as protein and ''sugar'' (glucose), and few if any cells. The spinal fluid also has a normal pressure when first removed.' "
What is normal CSF?,"'Normal values for spinal fluid examination are as follows:''These normal values can be altered by injury or disease of the brain, spinal cord, or adjacent tissues. The values are routinely evaluated during examination of the spinal fluid obtained from the lumbar puncture. Additionally, spinal fluid is tested for infection in the microbiology laboratory.''A health care professional will usually review and interpret the test results with the patient. These results often will need to be evaluated in relation to other blood and radiologic test results.' Protein (15-60 mg/dl) Glucose (50-80 mg/dl) Cell count (0-5 mononuclear cells) Initial pressure (70-180 mm)"
What diseases are diagnosed by examination of the CSF?,"'Spinal fluid obtained from the lumbar puncture can be used to diagnose many important diseases such as bleeding around the brain; increased pressure from ''hydrocephalus''; inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, or adjacent tissues (''encephalitis'', meningitis); tumors of the brain or spinal cord, etc. Sometimes spinal fluid can indicate diseases of the immune system, such as ''multiple sclerosis''.' "
"What are possible risks, complications, or side effects of a lumbar puncture?","'When spinal fluid is removed during an LP, the risks include ''headache''\xa0from a persistent spinal fluid leak, brain herniation, bleeding, and infection. Each of these complications are uncommon with the exception of ''headache'', which can appear from hours to up to a day after a lumbar puncture. Up to 25% of patients will get ''headaches'' after the procedure. ''Headaches'' occur less frequently when the patient remains lying flat several hours after the procedure.'  "
What are the benefits of a lumbar puncture?,"'The benefits of the LP depend upon the exact situation for which it is performed, but a lumbar puncture can provide lifesaving information.' "
What is a radial head subluxation?,"'The elbow is made up of the upper arm bone (humerus) and two bones in the forearm (radius and ulna). Some strong ligaments in the elbow hold these bones in the elbow joint together.''A radial head subluxation occurs when the radius bone slips partially out of the elbow joint. It is known as a nursemaid’s elbow. It occurs most commonly in children, particularly below six years of age. Two to three years is the most affected age group in children.''The two joints in the elbow are:''Humeroulnar joint: This joint is between the ulna and humerus that allows the bending of the elbow.''Radiocapitellar joint: This joint is between the radius and humerus that allows the rotation of the forearm to turn the palm up or down.'""A nursemaid's elbow occurs when there is a subluxation of the radiocapitellar joint."" "
What causes a radial head subluxation?,"'In children, ligaments around the elbow are not as developed as they are in adults, therefore it takes only a little force to pull the radius out of its place in the elbow. This usually happens when children are pulled from their wrist with their hands in extension or pulled suddenly from their arms. Generally, caregivers do this to avoid the child from falling from steps or stopping the child from doing something dangerous.''A radial head subluxation may also occur when a child is held by his/her wrist and swung around playfully.''Radial head subluxations rarely happen because of a fall. If the child’s elbow becomes extremely painful and he/she refuses to move his/her arm after a fall, then there may be more to a radial head subluxation - there may be a complete radial head dislocation or/and a ''fracture''.''Patients with previous radial head ''fractures'' are more likely to get a radial head subluxation.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a radial head subluxation?,"'Using the arm with a radial head subluxation will be extremely painful for the child. Hence, the child will hold the arm close to his/her body and refuse to bend or rotate the elbow or use the arm.' "
How does the doctor diagnose a radial head subluxation?,"'A doctor can usually diagnose radial head subluxations by looking at how the child is holding his/her arm.''Although an X-ray is not required for your doctor to diagnose a radial head subluxation, he or she may order one to make sure there is no fracture.' "
What is the reduction of a radial head subluxation?,"'The doctor will gently move the bones back into their normal position to fix a radial head subluxation. This procedure is known as reduction of a radial head subluxation and is done as follows:' The doctor will hold the child’s wrist or forearm and rotate the hand outward till the palm faces up. While pressing near the top of the radius bone with his or her thumb, the doctor will slowly bend the elbow. When this happens, a small click may be heard which means reduction has been achieved."
What happens after the reduction of a radial head subluxation?,"'Following the reduction, the child gets immediate relief from the ''elbow pain''.''The doctor will leave the child and return after 10 minutes to check if the child can move his/her affected arm. Sometimes, the child may take 30 minutes to resume moving his/her hand normally.''If the child is still unable to move his/her hand normally, the doctor will repeat the reduction. If the child does not begin using the arm normally after such repeated attempts, an X-ray of the elbow will be taken to observe for broken bones.''Although a sling may be placed on the elbow for 24 hours, it is not required for most patients. Only if the symptoms last for several days, a sling may be worn for longer.' "
How can a radial head subluxation be prevented in children?,'It is easy to prevent radial head subluxations in children by just taking a few precautions:' Do not swing a child by holding his/her hands or arms. Do not tug or pull on a child’s hands or arms. Lift a child safely by grasping gently under his/her arms and not by holding his/her hands or arms.
What is radiation therapy?,"'In radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy), invisible high-energy rays or beams of subatomic particles are used to damage ''cancer'' cells and can stop them from growing and dividing. This ultimately can kill the ''cancer'' cells treated with radiation. A specialist in radiation therapy is called a radiation oncologist.' "
What are the types of radiation therapy?,"'External radiation therapy is usually given on an outpatient basis in a hospital or clinic with specialized equipment 5 days a week for a number of weeks. Patients are not radioactive during or after the treatment with external beam radiation therapy.''For internal radiation therapy, the patient often stays in the hospital for a few days. The implant may be temporary or permanent. Because the level of radiation is highest during the hospital stay, patients may not be able to have visitors or may have visitors only for a short time. Once an implant is removed, there is no radioactivity in the body. The amount of radiation given off to the outside from a permanent implant goes down to a safe level before the patient leaves the hospital.'   Like surgery, radiation therapy can be a local treatment; it affects cancer cells only in the treated area. If the area treated is broader, we say it is then a regional treatment. Rarely, the whole body is given radiation therapy for a systemic or total-body effect. Radiation can come from a machine (external radiation). It can also come from an implant (a small container of radioactive material) placed (either temporarily or permanently) directly into or near the tumor (internal or interstitial radiation). Some patients receive both kinds of radiation therapy."
What are the side effects of radiation therapy?,"'With radiation therapy, the side effects depend on the treatment dose and the part of the body that is treated. The most common side effects are:''Radiation therapy can cause inflammation of tissues and organs in and around the body site radiated.''Radiation therapy can also cause a decrease in the number of white blood cells, which help protect the body against infection. Today radiation therapy using modern types of equipment can be better focused and thereby result in fewer side effects.''Although the side effects of radiation therapy can be unpleasant, they can usually be treated or controlled. It also helps to know that, in most cases, they are not permanent. Again, the possible side effects of radiation therapy depend on the location and the amount of radiation.'   tiredness and skin reactions (such as a rash or redness, permanent pigmentation, and scarring) in the treated area. This can cause symptoms that depend on what organs are affected and to what degree. For example, radiation can inflame skin to cause a burn or permanent pigmentation. It can also irritate the colon and cause diarrhea."
Introduction,"'Radiation therapy'' is a form of ''cancer'' treatment that uses high levels of ''radiation'' to kill ''cancer'' cells or keep them from growing and dividing -- while minimizing damage to healthy cells.''Radiation is delivered to the affected breast and, in some cases, to the ''lymph nodes'' under the arm or at the collarbone.' "
When Is Radiation Therapy Given?,"'Radiation therapy is usually given after a ''lumpectomy'' and sometimes after a ''mastectomy'' to reduce your risk of local recurrence of ''cancer'' in that breast. The treatments generally start several weeks after the surgery so the area has some time to heal. If your doctor recommends ''chemotherapy'' along with radiation therapy, this might be given before you start radiation therapy.''Once radiation treatments start, you can expect to receive small daily doses of radiation over a period of several days to several weeks.' "
What Happens On Treatment Days?,"'The radiation therapist will escort you into the treatment room. The therapist will help you onto the treatment table and help place you in the correct treatment position. Once the therapist is sure you are positioned correctly, he or she will leave the room and start the radiation treatment.''You will be under constant observation during the treatment. Cameras and an intercom are in the treatment room, so the therapist can always see and hear you. If you should have a problem, you can let the therapist know. It is very important that you remain still and relaxed during treatment.''The therapist will be in and out of the room to reposition the machine and change your position. The treatment machine will not touch you and you will feel nothing during the treatment. Once your treatment is complete, the therapist will help you get off the treatment table.' "
How Will The Radiation Therapist Know I Am In The Correct Position?,"'The radiation therapist will take a ""port film,"" also known as an X-ray, on the first day of treatment and approximately every week thereafter. Port films verify that you are being accurately positioned during your treatments.''Port films do not provide diagnostic information, so radiation therapists cannot learn about your progress from these films. However, port films are important to help the therapists maintain precision in your treatment.' "
Why Are There Marks On My Skin?,'Small marks resembling ''freckles'' will be tattooed on your skin along the treatment area by the radiation therapist. These marks provide a permanent outline of your treatment area. Do not try to wash these marks off or retouch them if they fade. The therapist will remark the treatment area when necessary.' 
Will My Diet Make A Difference On The Effect Of My Treatment?,"'Yes. Good ''nutrition'' is an important part of recovering from the side effects of radiation therapy. When you are eating well, you have the energy to do the activities you want to do, and your body is able to heal and fight infection. Most importantly, good ''nutrition'"" can give you a sense of well-being. Since eating when you don't feel well can be difficult, a dietitian can help you find ways to get the nutrients you need during your radiation therapy."" "
What Side Effects Will I Have?,"'During your treatment, radiation must pass through your skin. You may notice some skin changes in the area exposed to radiation. Your skin may become red, swollen, warm, and sensitive -- as if you had a ''sunburn''. It may peel or become moist and tender. Depending on the dose of radiation you receive, you may notice a loss of hair or decreased ''perspiration'' within the treated area.''These skin reactions are common and temporary -- they will subside gradually within four to six weeks of completing treatment. If skin changes appear outside the treated area, inform your doctor or primary nurse.''Long-term side effects, which can last up to a year or longer after treatment, may include a slight darkening of the skin, enlarged pores on the breast, increased or decreased sensitivity of the skin, a thickening of breast tissue or skin, and a change in the size of the breast.' "
How Can I Reduce Skin Reactions?," Gently cleanse the treated area using lukewarm water and a mild soap such as Ivory, Dove, Neutrogena, Basis, Castille, or Aveeno Oatmeal Soap. Do not rub your skin. Pat your skin dry with a soft towel or use a hair dryer on a cool setting. Do not scratch or rub the treated area. Do not apply any ointment, cream, lotion or powder to the treated area unless your radiation oncologist or nurse has prescribed it. Do not apply cosmetics, shaving lotions, perfumes, or deodorants on the treated area. Use only an electric razor if you need to shave within the treated area. Do not wear tight-fitting clothing or clothes made from harsh fabrics such as wool or corduroy -- these fabrics can irritate the skin. Instead, choose clothes made from natural fibers such as cotton. Do not apply medical tape or bandages to the treated area. Do not expose the treated area to extreme heat or cold. Avoid using an electric heating pad, hot water bottle or ice pack. Do not expose the treated area to direct sunlight -- sun exposure may intensify your skin reaction and lead to severe sunburn. Choose a sunblock/sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher. Protect yourself from direct sunlight even after your course of treatment has been completed."
Will Radiation Therapy Make Me Tired?,"'Everyone has a different level of energy, so radiation treatment will affect each patient differently. Patients frequently experience ''fatigue'' after several weeks of treatment. For most patients, this ''fatigue'' is mild. However, a loss of energy may require other patients to change their daily routine.''If your doctor thinks it may be necessary for you to limit your activity, he or she will discuss it with you.''To minimize ''fatigue'' while you are receiving radiation treatment:' Be sure to get enough rest. Eat a well-balanced, nutritious diet. Pace your activities and plan frequent rest periods."
Who Can I Contact If I Have Personal Concerns About My Treatment?,"'Generally, a social worker will be available to help you during your course of treatment.''The social worker can discuss any emotional issues or other concerns about your treatment or your personal situation. The social worker can also discuss housing or transportation needs or appropriate resources if necessary.''People dealing with certain medical issues often find it helpful to share experiences with others in the same situation. Your physician can provide a list of support groups if you are interested. Your social worker can provide additional information about more support groups that may be of value to you.' "
What About Follow-Up Care?,"'After your radiation therapy sessions are complete, you will visit your doctor for periodic follow-up exams and diagnostic ''X-rays''. Your doctor will tell you how often to schedule your follow-up appointments.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center.''Edited by Charlotte E. Grayson, MD, WebMD, February 2004.''Portions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic'' 2000-2004' "
What is a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure whereby the uterus (womb) is removed. This surgery for women is the most common non-obstetrical surgical procedure in the United States.''Approximately 300 out of every 100,000 women will undergo a hysterectomy.'  "
What are the three types of prolapse?,"'A hysterectomy is performed for the treatment of ''uterine cancer'' or very severe pre-''cancers'' (called dysplasia, ''carcinoma in situ'', or CIN III or microinvasive ''carcinoma'' of the cervix). A hysterectomy for ''endometrial cancer'' (uterine lining ''cancer'') is the removal of the ''cancer'' from the body. Hysterectomy is the foundation of treatment for uterine ''cancer''.''The most common reason hysterectomy is performed is for ''uterine fibroids''.''Other common reasons are:''Only 10% of hysterectomies are performed for cancer. This article will primarily focus on the use of hysterectomy for non-cancerous, non-emergency reasons, which can involve even more challenging decisions for women and their doctors.''The most common reason for a hysterecotmy are ''uterine fibroids'' (also known as uterine leiomyomata). ''Uterine fibroids'"" are benign (non-cancerous) growths of the uterus, the cause of which is unknown. Although the majority of them don't cause or turn into uterine cancer""'Uterine fibroids can cause medical problems. Reasons for a hysterectomy in women with uterine fibroids are:''Pelvic relaxation'' is another condition that can require treatment with a hysterectomy. In this condition, a woman experiences a loosening of the support muscles and tissues in the pelvic floor area. Mild relaxation can cause first degree prolapse''There are three types of prolapse:''Second and third degree uterine prolapse must be treated with hysterectomy.''A ''cystocele'', rectocele, or urethrocele can lead to symptoms of, for example:''Urine loss tends to be aggravated by:''Risk factors for pelvic relaxation'':The most common risk factor for pelvic relaxation is childbearing; although, there may be other causes. Avoiding birth and having a caesarean section (''C-section'"") doesn't necessarily eliminate the risk of developing pelvic relaxation."" Abnormal uterine bleeding (vaginal bleeding), Cervical dysplasia (pre-cancerous conditions of the cervix), Endometriosis Urerine prolapse (including pelvic relaxation). Excessive size (usually greater than the size of a two-month pregnancy). Pressure or pain. Bleeding severe enough to cause anemia. First degree prolapse: Mild relaxation can cause, in which the cervix (the uterine opening) is about halfway down into the vagina. Second degree prolapse: In second degree prolapse the cervix or leading edge of the uterus has moved to the vaginal opening. Third degree prolapse: In third degree prolapse, the cervix and uterus protrude past the vaginal opening. Urinary incontinence (unintentional loss of urine) Pelvic heaviness Impaired sexual performance. Sneezing Coughing Jumping Laughing"
What tests or treatments are performed prior to a hysterectomy?,"'A woman must have a pelvic examination, ''Pap smear'', and a diagnosis prior to proceeding with a hysterectomy.''Therefore, a premenopausal (still having regular menstrual periods) woman whose uterine fibroids are causing bleeding but no pain is generally first offered medical therapy with hormones. Non-hormonal treatments are also available, such as ''tranexamic acid'' and more moderate surgical procedures, such as ablations (removal of the lining of the uterus). If she still has significant bleeding that causes major impairment to her daily life, or the bleeding continues to cause ''anemia'' (''low red blood cell count'' due to blood loss), and she has no abnormality on endometrial sampling, she may be considered for a hysterectomy.''A ''postmenopausal'' woman (whose menstrual periods have ceased permanently) who has no abnormalities in the samples of her uterus (endometrial sampling) and still has persistent abnormal bleeding after trying ''hormone therapy'', may be considered for a hysterectomy. Several dose adjustments or different types of hormones may be required to decide on the optimal medical treatment for an individual woman.' Prior to having a hysterectomy for pelvic pain, women might undergo more limited (less extensive) exploratory surgery procedures (such as laparoscopy) to rule out other causes of pain. Prior to having a hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding, women require some type of sampling of the lining of the uterus (biopsy of the endometrium) to rule out cancer or pre-cancer of the uterus. This procedure is called endometrial sampling. Also, pelvic ultrasounds and/or pelvic computerized tomography (CT) tests can be done to confirm a diagnosis. In a woman with pelvic pain or bleeding, a trial of medication treatment is often given before a hysterectomy is considered."
How is a hysterectomy performed?,"   In the past the most common hysterectomy was done by an incision (cut) through the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy). Now most surgeries can utilize laparoscopic assisted or vaginal hysterectomies (performed through the vagina rather than through the abdomen) for quicker and easier recovery. The hospital stay generally tends to be longer with an abdominal hysterectomy than with a vaginal hysterectomy, and hospital charges tend to be higher. The procedures seem to take comparable lengths of time (about two hours), unless the uterus is of a very large size, in which case a vaginal hysterectomy may take longer."
What are the types of hysterectomies?,"'There are now a variety of surgical techniques for performing hysterectomies. The ideal surgical procedure for each woman depends on her particular medical condition. Below, the different types of hysterectomy are discussed with general guidelines about which technique is considered for which type of medical situation. However, the final decision must be made after an individualized discussion between the woman and physician who best understands her individual situation.''Remember, as a general rule, before any type of hysterectomy, women should have the following tests in order to select the optimal procedure:' Complete pelvic exam including manually examining the ovaries and uterus. Up-to-date Pap smear. Pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate, depending on what the physician finds on examination. A decision regarding whether or not to remove the ovaries at the time of hysterectomy. A complete blood count and an attempt to correct anemia if possible. Total abdominal hysterectomy Vaginal hysterectomy Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy Supracervical hysterectomy Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy Radical hysterectomy Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy"
"Total abdominal hysterectomy, the most common type","'The total abdominal hysterectomy\xa0is the most common type of hysterectomy. During a total abdominal hysterectomy, the doctor removes the uterus, including the cervix. The ''scar'' on the abdomen may be horizontal or vertical, depending on the reason the procedure is performed, and the size of the area being treated.' Cancer of the ovary(s) and uterus, endometriosis, and large uterine fibroids are treated with total abdominal hysterectomy. Total abdominal hysterectomy may also be done in some unusual cases of very severe pelvic pain, after a very thorough evaluation to identify the cause of the pain, and only after attempts at non-surgical treatments. Clearly a woman cannot bear children after this procedure, so it is not generally performed on women who desire childbearing unless there is a serious condition, such as cancer. Total abdominal hysterectomy allows the whole abdomen and pelvis to be examined, which is an advantage in women with cancer or investigating growths of unclear cause."
Vaginal hysterectomy procedure,"'During this procedure, the uterus is removed through the vagina. A vaginal hysterectomy is appropriate for conditions such as uterine prolapse, endometrial hyperplasia, or cervical dysplasia.' These are conditions in which the uterus is not too large, and in which the whole abdomen does not require examination using a more extensive surgical procedure. The woman will need to have her legs raised up in a stirrup device throughout the procedure. Women who have not had children may not have a large enough vaginal canal for this type of procedure. If a woman has too large a uterus, cannot have her legs raised in the stirrup device for prolonged periods, or has other reasons why the whole upper abdomen must be further examined, the doctor will usually recommend an abdominal hysterectomy."
Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy,"'Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (''LAVH'') is similar to the vaginal hysterectomy procedure described above, but it adds the use of a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a very thin viewing tube used to visualize structures within the abdomen. Certain women would be best served by having laparoscopy used during vaginal hysterectomy because it allows the upper abdomen to be carefully inspected during surgery. Examples of uses of the laparoscope would be for early endometrial cancer (to verify lack of spread of cancer), or if oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is planned. Just as with simple vaginal hysterectomy without a laparoscope, the uterus must not be excessively large. The physician will also review the medical situation to be sure there are no special risks prohibiting use of the procedure, such as prior surgery that could have increased the risk for abnormal scarring (adhesions). If a woman has such a history of prior surgery, or if she has a large pelvic mass, a regular abdominal hysterectomy might be considered.' "
Supracervical hysterectomy,"'A supracervical hysterectomy is used to remove the uterus while sparing the cervix, leaving it as a ""stump."" The cervix is the area that forms the very bottom of the uterus, and sits at the very end (top) of the vaginal canal (see illustration above). The procedure probably does not totally rule out the possibility of developing cancer in this remnant ""stump."" Women who have had abnormal Pap smears or ''cervical cancer'' clearly are not appropriate candidates for this procedure. Other women may be able to have the procedure if there is no reason to have the cervix removed. In some cases the cervix is actually better left in place, such as some cases of severe ''endometriosis''. It is a simpler procedure and requires less time to perform. It may give some added support of the vagina, decreasing the risk for the development of protrusion of the vaginal contents through the vaginal opening (vaginal prolapse).' "
Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy,"'The laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy procedure is performed like the LAVH procedure, but the uterus is separated from the cervix, and the uterine tissue is removed through the laparoscopic incision. Recovery is generally faster than with other types of hysterectomy. Cervical preservation is less likely to result in menses (''menstruation'') as the inner lining of the cervix is usually cauterized.' "
Radical hysterectomy,'The radical hysterectomy procedure involves more extensive surgery than a total abdominal hysterectomy because it also includes removing tissues surrounding the uterus and removal of the upper vagina. Radical hysterectomy is most commonly performed for early ''cervical cancer''. There are more complications with radical hysterectomy compared to abdominal hysterectomy. These include injury to the bowels and urinary system.' 
Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes),"'Oophorectomy is the surgical removal of the ovary(s), while oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes)is the removal of the ovary and its adjacent Fallopian tube. These two procedures are performed for ''ovarian cancer'', removal of suspicious ovarian tumors, or Fallopian tube cancer (which is very rare). They may also be performed due to complications of infection, or in combination with hysterectomy for cancer. Occasionally, women with ''inherited'' types of cancer of the ovary or breast will have an oophorectomy as preventive (prophylactic) surgery in order to reduce the risk of future cancer of the ovary or breast. Current recommendations are that the fallopian tubes should be removed during hysterectomy even if the ovaries are preserved. This is done to decrease the lifetime risk of ''ovarian cancer'', which can arise from the fallopian tubes in up to 25% of case.' "
What are complications of a hysterectomy?,"'Complications of a hysterectomy include''An abdominal hysterectomy has a higher rate of post-operative infection and pain than does a vaginal hysterectomy.'   infection, pain, and bleeding in the surgical area."
What are the alternatives to a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy for conditions other than cancer generally are not considered until after other less invasive treatments are unsuccessful.' Newer procedures, for example, uterine artery embolization (UAE) or surgical removal of a portion of the uterus (myomectomy), are being used to treat excessive uterine bleeding. Endometrial ablation and newer medications are alternatives."
Should women who have had a hysterectomy continue to have Pap smears?,"'Any woman with a history of abnormal Pap smears should have Pap smears for the remainder of her life. This is because of the low, but real, chance that cervical cancer can recur at the surgical site where the cervix was removed.''In addition, women with a history of abnormal Pap smears, other women who require continued. Pap smears are women with supracervical hysterectomy, where the cervix was left in place. In this situation, in contrast to the woman who has had hysterectomy for reasons of cervical cancer, the woman who has had supracervical hysterectomy will be able to follow the same screening guidelines as for other women who have not had surgery. For example, the physician may stop doing Pap smears at age 65 if the woman has been well-screened and has always had normal Pap smears.''Women who do not need to continue having Pap smears are those who have had vaginal hysterectomy or abdominal hysterectomy for benign (not cancer) reasons, such as uterine fibroids. If they have had normal Pap smears prior to the procedure, they need not continue to have Pap smears after their surgery.' "
What is a mastectomy?,"'Mastectomy'' is the removal of one or both breasts. You may need a mastectomy for the following reasons' Breast cancer: Mastectomy is one of the mainstays of treatment for breast cancer. Preventive breast cancer: Women who have a higher risk of breast cancer due to changes in their genes (unit of heredity) may require a mastectomy. Gender change: One of the gender reassignment surgeries may be required while changing gender from a woman to man. Gynecomastia: This is breast development in a man due to hormonal causes. Such men require mastectomy. Serious connective tissue disease: This includes scleroderma (chronic hardening and tightening of the skin and connective tissues), which may necessitate a mastectomy."
What is a radical mastectomy?,"'In a radical mastectomy, the entire breast tissue along with the ''nipple'', covering skin, ''lymph nodes'' (filter organs for harmful substances) in the armpit and chest wall muscle under the breast is removed. It is known as a standard treatment for breast ''cancer''.' "
What is a modified radical mastectomy?,"'In a modified radical mastectomy (MRM), the entire breast is removed, including the skin, ''areola'' (surrounding the nipple), nipple and most armpit lymph nodes. Your underlying chest wall muscles (the pecs) will be left intact. Additionally, the skin covering your chest wall may or may not be removed. Therefore, you can go for ''breast reconstruction'' later.\xa0' "
What is the difference between a radical mastectomy and an MRM?,"'Today, a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) has become the primary standard surgical treatment option for breast ''cancer''. Traditional radical mastectomies are rarely done today because of the success with MRMs. Here are the differences''The cancer surgeon (oncosurgeon) always aims to remove the entire cancerous growth. Your cancer specialist (oncologist) or oncosurgeon will discuss the available options for you depending on your clinical scenario. They will thoroughly discuss surgical options to achieve the best outcome.' Degrees of parts removal: Radical mastectomy and MRM are performed with varying degrees of tissue and lymph node removal. During an MRM, your surgeon will remove the entire breast, including the nipple and most of the lymph nodes underlying the arm, with or without the underlying skin. However, the underlying chest muscles will be left in the place, unlike a traditional radical mastectomy. Complexity: An MRM is less complicated and less extensive than a radical mastectomy that involves removal of various nearby tissues and may require a longer time to execute.  Effectiveness: Studies have shown that MRM and radical mastectomy are equally effective in the early stages of breast cancer to control the disease. Appearance after surgery: An MRM causes less disfigurement and takes much less of a toll on a woman’s appearance than a radical mastectomy. Following a radical mastectomy, women often have a hollow in the chest. Because the chest muscle is kept in place with an MRM, this doesn’t happen. Side effects and complicationsLymphedema: The risk of lymphedema (swollen lymph nodes in the arm) is less in an MRM than in a radical mastectomy.Angiosarcoma: There is a higher risk of a rare soft tissue tumor in the breast after a radical mastectomy known as secondary angiosarcoma. Other complications: Studies have proven an MRM to be generally safe and effective and it has only complications like any surgical procedure such as bleeding, infection, redness, tenderness of the incisional site, scarring, arm swelling , seroma (fluid pocket formation underneath the incision), decreased range of motion, blood collection outside of a blood vessel, numbness and skin necrosis (degeneration). Lymphedema: The risk of lymphedema (swollen lymph nodes in the arm) is less in an MRM than in a radical mastectomy. Angiosarcoma: There is a higher risk of a rare soft tissue tumor in the breast after a radical mastectomy known as secondary angiosarcoma.  Other complications: Studies have proven an MRM to be generally safe and effective and it has only complications like any surgical procedure such as bleeding, infection, redness, tenderness of the incisional site, scarring, arm swelling , seroma (fluid pocket formation underneath the incision), decreased range of motion, blood collection outside of a blood vessel, numbness and skin necrosis (degeneration). Stay at the hospital: Radical mastectomy and MRM both require a similar short stay at the hospital. Reconstruction of the breast: Reconstruction of the breast after an MRM is usually easier to accomplish than after a radical mastectomy because the chest wall muscles and sometimes skin coverings are preserved with an MRM. Survival: Studies have demonstrated that there are no differences in the survival rates of women who underwent an MRM and those who underwent a radical mastectomy. Local recurrence: Women treated with an MRM may have a higher risk of local recurrence of cancerous growth, particularly if they had cancer that extended toward the armpit lymph node. Therefore, they may require radiotherapy after an MRM."
When will your surgeon recommend a radical mastectomy or an MRM?,"'Your surgeon will choose the surgery depending on your age, general health, ''menopause'' status, tumor size, how far your tumor spread, its aggressiveness, the tumor hormone receptor status and whether your breast lymph nodes are involved. Some points are discussed below' Stages of breast cancer: A modified radical mastectomy (MRM) is especially helpful for women with early-stage breast cancer (stages I and II) that has extended to the lymph nodes. A radical mastectomy nowadays is recommended only for women with advanced breast cancer (stage III) that extends to the chest muscles underlying the breast. Tumor size: An MRM is usually recommended if the tumor is large and cancer has already spread to the lymph nodes. The spread of cancer: Women who have invasive breast cancer and decide to have mastectomies will receive an MRM so their lymph nodes can be examined. This lymph node examination allows identification of cancer cells that may have spread beyond the breast called metastasis. Exposure to the armpit: A slightly more favorable group of women with breast cancer may be treated with an MRM rather than a radical mastectomy. However, doctors may recommend women with advanced breast cancer (stage III) have a radical mastectomy for better exposure to the armpit as an alternative surgical option. Menopause status: In menopausal women, an MRM is more preferable."
What are the other mastectomy surgeries?," Simple or total mastectomy: In this surgery, the entire breasts will be removed. However, the underlying chest wall muscles and sometimes armpit lymph nodes are secured.  Partial mastectomy: This is removal of the cancerous part of the breast tissue and some normal tissue around it. Nipple-sparing mastectomy: In this surgery, the entire breast tissue is removed, but the nipples are kept intact."
What is radiculopathy?,"'Radiculopathy is a condition due to a ''compressed nerve'' in the spine that can cause ''pain'', numbness, tingling, or weakness along the course of the nerve. Radiculopathy can occur in any part of the spine, but it is most common in the lower back (''lumbar radiculopathy'') and in the neck (cervical radiculopathy). It is less commonly found in the middle portion of the spine (thoracic radiculopathy).'  "
What are the risk factors for radiculopathy?,'Risk factors for radiculopathy are activities that place an excessive or repetitive load on the spine. Patients involved in heavy labor or contact sports are more prone to develop radiculopathy than those with a more sedentary lifestyle. A family history of radiculopathy or other spine disorders also increases the risk of developing radiculopathy.' 
What are the causes of radiculopathy?,"'Radiculopathy is caused by compression or irritation of the nerves as they exit the spine. This can be due to mechanical compression of the nerve by a disc herniation, a bone spur (''osteophytes'') from ''osteoarthritis'', or from thickening of surrounding ligaments.''Other less common causes of mechanical compression of the nerves are from a ''tumor'' or infection. Either of these can reduce the amount of space in the spinal canal and compress the exiting nerve.''Scoliosis'' can cause the nerves on one side of the spine to become compressed by the abnormal curve of the spine.''Inflammation from ''trauma'' or degeneration can lead to radiculopathy from direct irritation of the nerves.'  "
What are the symptoms of radiculopathy?,"'The symptoms of radiculopathy depend on which nerves are affected. The nerves exiting from the neck (cervical spine) control the muscles of the neck and arms and supply sensation there. The nerves from the middle portion of the back (thoracic spine) control the muscles of the chest and abdomen and supply sensation there. The nerves from the lower back (''lumbar'' spine) control the muscles of the buttocks and legs and supply sensation there. ''The most common symptoms of radiculopathy are pain, numbness, and tingling in the arms or legs. It is common for patients to also have localized neck or ''back pain'' as well. Lumbar radiculopathy that causes pain that radiates down a lower extremity is commonly referred to as ''sciatica''. Thoracic radiculopathy causes pain from the middle back that travels around to the chest. It is often mistaken for ''shingles''.''Some patients develop a hypersensitivity to light touch that feels painful in the area involved. Less commonly, patients can develop weakness in the muscles controlled by the affected nerves. This can indicate nerve damage. '  "
How is radiculopathy diagnosed?,"""The diagnosis of radiculopathy begins with a medical history and physical examination by the physician. During the medical history, the doctor will ask questions about the type and location of symptoms, how long they have been present, what makes them better and worse, and what other medical problems present. By knowing the exact location of the patient's symptoms, the doctor can help localize the nerve that is responsible. The physical examination will focus on the extremity involved. The doctor will check the patient's muscle strength, sensation, and reflexes to see if there are any abnormalities.""'The patient may then be asked to obtain imaging studies to look for a source of the radiculopathy. Plain X-rays are often obtained first. These can often identify the presence of trauma or ''osteoarthritis'' and early signs of tumor or infection. An ''MRI'' scan may then be obtained. This study provides the best look at the soft tissues around the spine including the nerves, the disc and the ligaments. If the patient is unable to obtain an MRI, they may obtain a ''CT scan'' instead to explore possible compression of the nerves.''In some cases the doctor may order a nerve conduction study or ''electromyogram'' (''EMG''). These studies look at the electrical activity along the nerve and can show if there is damage to the nerve.'  "
What is the treatment for radiculopathy?,"'Fortunately, most people can obtain good relief of their symptoms of radiculopathy with conservative treatment. This may include anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy or chiropractic treatment, and avoiding activity that ''strains'' the neck or back. The majority of radiculopathy patients respond well to this conservative treatment, and symptoms often improve within 6 weeks to 3 months.''If patients do not improve with the treatments listed above they may benefit from an ''epidural steroid injection''. With the help of an X-ray machine, a physician injects steroid medication between the bones of the spine adjacent to the involved nerves. This can help to rapidly reduce the inflammation and irritation of the nerve and help reduce the symptoms of radiculopathy.''In some cases the symptoms continue despite all of the above treatment options. If this occurs and the symptoms are severe, surgery may be an option. The goal of the surgery is to remove the compression from the affected nerve. Depending on the cause of the radiculopathy, this can be done by a laminectomy or a discectomy. A laminectomy removes a small portion of the bone covering the nerve to allow it to have additional space. A discectomy removes the portion of the disc that has herniated out and is compressing a nerve.'  "
Can radiculopathy be prevented?,"'There is no specific ''prevention'' for radiculopathy. Maintaining a reasonable weight, good muscle conditioning, and avoiding excessive strain on the neck and back can reduce the chances of developing radiculopathy.' "
What is the outlook for radiculopathy?,"'The outlook for radiculopathy is good. The majority of patients respond well to conservative treatment options. Those patients that need surgical procedures typically obtain good results as well with no long-term restrictions.' Radiculopathy is caused by compression or irritation of a nerve as it exits the spinal column. Symptoms of radiculopathy include pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the arms or legs. Most patients with radiculopathy respond well to conservative treatment including medications, physical therapy, or chiropractic treatment. Radiculopathy may resolve within 6 weeks to 3 months."
What is radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the liver?,"'Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a technique that uses high frequency electrical energy that creates heat, delivered through a thin instrument known as a probe, to destroy tissue. It is used in the ''liver'' to destroy tumors (either primary liver ''cancers'' or cancers that have metastasized or spread to the liver) that cannot be removed by traditional surgery. ''Radiofrequency ablation also is\xa0 used in many other medical conditions. Examples of other uses of radiofrequency ablation include: ' The management 
of lumbar or low back 
	arthritis pain by ablating nerve tissue to reduce 
	pain 
signals Destruction of areas of the heart that cause
	abnormal heart rhythms 
(arrhythmias) Treatment of
	varicose veins Destruction of tumors in other 
sites of the body, including the
	esophagus, kidney, lung, and prostate."
What are uses of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the liver?,"'Radiofrequency ablation is used to treat hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) of the liver, primary cancers that arise in the liver cells, when these tumors are small and the patient is not an appropriate candidate for surgical removal of the ''tumor'' or liver transplantation. Radiofrequency ablation also can be used on liver tumors that have originated elsewhere in the body and have spread (metastasized) to the liver.' "
What size tumor is treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA)?,"'The maximum size for a liver tumor to be treated by ablation has not been established. However, radiofrequency ablation is best suited for tumors less than 5 cm. Larger tumors may require more than one session.' "
How do I prepare for radiofrequency ablation (RFA)?,"'Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to prepare for the procedure. You may be advised to stop taking blood-thinner medications before the procedure and not to drink or eat anything for some hours beforehand. Depending on the type of radiofrequency ablation that is done, and whether or not anesthesia is required, you may be able to return home after the procedure, or you may remain overnight in the hospital.' "
What kind of equipment is used for radiofrequency ablation (RFA)?,"'Imaging procedures like CT (computed tomography) scan, ''ultrasound'', or magnetic resonance imaging (''MRI'') are used to help guide the probe into the area of the tumor. The probe is designed like a long needle electrode through which a high-frequency electrical current is passed.' "
How does the radiofrequency ablation (RFA) procedure work?,"'Radiofrequency ablation can be performed in different ways. It may be administered during open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, or percutaneously (through the skin) using imaging studies to guide the placement of the probe. Interventional radiologists are the doctors who most commonly perform RFA through the skin, while surgeons may perform RFA during laparoscopic or open surgeries. ''In all cases of radiofrequency ablation, a probe is inserted into the center of the tumor and the non-insulated electrodes, which are shaped like prongs, are projected out from the central probe into the tumor. The local heat that is generated melts the tissue (in a process known as coagulative necrosis) that is adjacent to the probe. The probe is left in place for about 10 to 15 minutes. For larger tumors it might be necessary to re-position the probe in different areas of the tumor. Imaging studies are done anywhere from a few hours to weeks after the procedure to ensure that the entire tumor tissue has been cauterized.' "
What can expect during radiofrequency ablation (RFA)?,"'Radiofrequency ablation may be done using local anesthesia or general anesthesia (typically if RFA is performed during surgery). Radiofrequency ablation performed by inserting the needle probe through the skin can be done under local anesthesia in which the skin insertion site is numbed. Typically, an intravenous line is placed for delivery of fluid and medications. Monitoring devices to measure heart rate and ''blood pressure'' are attached to the body. ' "
How long does the procedure last?,"'Each radiofrequency ablation typically takes 10-30 minutes. Ablating more than one area requires more time. The entire procedure is usually finished in 1-3 hours. After the procedure, the patient remains in a recovery room until fully awake. ' "
What are the risks and side effects of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy?,"'Radiofrequency ablation is generally well-tolerated, and does not typically cause any serious pain after the treatment. There is a very low risk of bleeding or infection after the treatment as well as a low risk of injury to the gallbladder or bile ducts. Sometimes, a low-grade ''fever'' and ''flu-like symptoms'' may be present after the procedure for a few days. ''\xa0Other possible side effects of radiofrequency ablation include ' post-procedure 
pain,  inflammation of the gallbladder, and  injury to the bowel."
What is the success rate of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy?,"'In most studies, radiofrequency ablation is over 85% successful at destroying small liver tumors. Studies also show that over half of the tumors removed by radiofrequency ablation do not recur (come back). Because the treatment typically does not cause serious health risks, ''chemotherapy'' can be resumed (if needed) soon after the procedure. Radiofrequency ablation usually has few complications, and can be repeated if necessary for the same or additional tumors.' "
What is coronary heart disease?,"'Coronary ''heart disease'' or''coronary artery disease'' (''CAD'') is  ''atherosclerosis'' (plaque in artery walls) of the inner lining of the blood vessels that supply blood to the ''heart''. A similar term, ''arteriosclerosis'' which means hardening or stiffening of the arteries is sometimes interchanged with atherosclerosis by some authors. Coronary ''heart disease'' is a common form of ''heart disease'' and is a major cause of illness and death. Coronary heart disease begins when hard ''cholesterol'' substances (plaques) are deposited within a coronary artery. The coronary arteries arise from the ''aorta'', which is adjacent to the heart. The plaques narrow the internal diameter of the arteries (Figure1) which may cause a tiny clot to form which can obstruct the flow of blood to the heart muscle (Figure 2). Symptoms of coronary heart disease include:'  chest pain (angina pectoris) from inadequate blood flow to the heart;  heart attack, from the sudden total blockage of a coronary artery; or  sudden death, due to a fatal rhythm disturbance. "
What is the purpose of screening tests for coronary heart disease?,"'In many individuals, the first symptom of coronary heart disease is heart attack or sudden death, with no preceding ''chest pain'' as a warning. For this reason, doctors perform screening tests to detect signs of coronary heart disease before serious medical events occur so the tests are designed to detect plaque (Figure 1) before a coronary artery becomes completely blocked (Figure 2). Screening tests are of particular importance for people with risk factors for coronary heart disease. These risk factors include a family history of coronary heart disease at relatively young ages, an abnormal serum cholesterol profile,''cigarette smoking'', elevated ''blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), and ''diabetes mellitus''. '  "
"What are common initial screening tests for 
coronary heart disease?","'EKG'' (''Electrocardiogram'', ECC)''An electrocardiogram (EKG, ECC) usually is the first and most simple test used to look for any coronary heart disease signs. Unless the person is actively having a heart attack, which often is seen as an electrical change in the heart rhythm (ST segment elevation), the EKG may show electrical changes such as ST depressions or Q waves that suggest the patient has coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease with signs of a previous heart attack. An EKG often encourages the physician to proceed with initial screening test(s).''Initial screening for coronary heart disease commonly involves stressing the heart under controlled conditions. These ''stress'' tests are able to detect the presence of flow-limiting blockages in the coronary arteries, generally in the range of at least a 50% reduction in the diameter of at least one of the three major coronary arteries. There are two basic types of ''stress'' tests; those that involve exercising the patient to stress the heart (''exercise'' cardiac stress tests), and those that involve chemically stimulating the heart directly to mimic the stress of ''exercise'' (physiologic stress testing). Physiologic stress testing can be used for patients who are unable to exercise.' "
Exercise cardiac stress test (treadmill stress test or ECST),"'Exercise cardiac stress testing'"" (ECST) is the most widely used cardiac stress test. The patient exercises on a treadmill according to a standardized protocol, with progressive increases in the speed and elevation of the treadmill (typically changing at three minute intervals). During the ECST, the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG), heart rate, heart rhythm, and blood pressure are continuously monitored. If a coronary arterial blockage results in decreased blood flow to a part of the heart during exercise, certain changes (for example, ST segment depressions) may be observed in the EKG, as well as in the response of the heart rate and blood pressure. ""'The accuracy of the ECST in predicting significant coronary heart disease is variable, depending in part on the ""pre-test likelihood"" of coronary heart disease (also known as Bayes\' theorem). In a person at high risk for coronary heart disease (for example, advanced age, multiple coronary risk factors), an abnormal ECST is very predictive of the presence of coronary heart disease (over 90% accurate). However, a relatively normal ECST may not reflect the absence of significant disease in a person with the same risk factors. Conversely, in a person with a low-risk, a normal ECST is very predictive of the absence of significant coronary heart disease (over 90% accurate), but an abnormal test may not reflect the true presence of coronary heart disease (so-called ""false-positive ECST""). The ECST may either miss the presence of significant coronary heart disease, or be a false-positive test, due to a variety of cardiac circumstances, which may include: ''When the doctor determines that the results of the ECST do not accurately reflect the presence or absence of significant coronary heart disease, additional tests are often used to clarify the condition. These additional options include radionuclide isotope injection and ''ultrasound of the heart'' (stress ''echocardiography'') during the stress test.' An abnormal EKG at rest, which may be due to 
abnormal serum electrolytes, abnormal cardiac electrical conduction, or certain medications, such as digitalis; Heart conditions not related to coronary heart disease, such as mitral valve prolapse or hypertrophy (increased size) of the heart; or An inadequate increase in the heart rate and/or blood pressure during exercise."
Radionuclide stress test,"'Radionuclide stress testing involves injecting a radioactive isotope (typically ''thallium'"" or cardiolite) into the patient's vein after which an image of the patient's heart becomes visible with a special camera. The radioactive isotopes are absorbed by the normal heart muscle. Nuclear images are obtained in the resting condition, and again immediately following exercise. The two sets of images are then compared. During exercise, if a blockage in a coronary artery results in diminished blood flow to a part of the ""'cardiac muscle'', this region of the heart will appear as a relative ""''cold'' spot"" on the nuclear scan. This cold spot is not visible on the images that are taken while the patient is at rest (when coronary flow is adequate). Radionuclide stress testing, while more time-consuming and expensive than a simple ECST, greatly enhances the accuracy in diagnosing coronary heart disease. ' "
Stress echocardiography,"'Another supplement to the routine ECST is stress echocardiography. During stress echocardiography, the sound waves of ''ultrasound'' are used to produce images of the heart at rest and at the peak of exercise. In a heart with normal blood supply, all segments of the ''left ventricle'' (the major pumping chamber of the heart) exhibit enhanced contractions of the heart muscle during peak exercise. Conversely, in the setting of coronary heart disease, if a segment of the left ventricle does not receive optimal blood flow during exercise, that segment will demonstrate reduced contractions of heart muscle relative to the rest of the heart on the exercise ''echocardiogram''. Stress echocardiography is very useful in enhancing the interpretation of the ECST, and can be used to exclude the presence of significant coronary heart disease in patients suspected of having a ""false-positive"" ECST. ''What if a person is unable to exercise adequately for an exercise cardiac stress test?''Many people are unable to exercise maximally for stress testing due to a variety of conditions including ''arthritis'', severe lung disease, severe cardiac disease, orthopedic conditions, and diseases of the nervous system. In such individuals, pharmacological stress testing is often used. ' "
Pharmacologic stress test,"'During a pharmacologic stress test, certain medications are administered which stimulate the heart to mimic the physiologic effects of exercise. One of these medications is dobutamine, which is similar to adrenaline. Dobutamine is carefully administered to gradually increase the heart rate and strength of the contractions of the heart muscle. Simultaneously, echocardiography or radionuclide imaging is performed. ''Alternatively, a medicine called adenosine is administered, which simulates the physiology of the coronary artery circulation during exercise. Adenosine is combined with radionuclide isotope imaging to provide a very accurate test for the detection of significant coronary heart disease. A newer agent, regadenoson (Lexiscan), is often used as it seems to be better tolerated. Pharmacological stress testing is commonly performed in individuals who are thought to be at high risk for significant coronary heart disease and who are scheduled for major non-cardiac surgical procedures. These people often are unable to perform exercise stress testing due to the underlying condition for which they require surgery. In this setting, pharmacological stress testing is invaluable in assessing the cardiac risk of patients prior to surgery. ' "
"Are there other tests for 
coronary heart disease that are noninvasive?","'A new noninvasive test for the detection of coronary heart disease is electron beam ''computerized tomography'"" (EBCT), or calcium scoring. Unlike the above mentioned stress tests that measure the heart's physiology, EBCT is designed to measure calcium deposits in the coronary arteries. ""'In individuals with coronary heart disease, the plaques which make up the blockages contain significant amounts of calcium, which can be detected with the CT scanner and the amount of blockage is calculated by calcium scoring. This test will identify calcium in blockages as mild as 10%-20%, which would not be detected by standard physiological testing. When such mild blockages are detected, however, the only recommended therapy is risk factor modification (cholesterol lowering and cessation of ''smoking'' if applicable), and adjunctive use of ''aspirin'' and certain ''vitamins''; such therapy would be advised in all persons with risk factors for coronary heart disease, regardless of the results of any noninvasive tests. ''Calcium scoring may be very helpful in convincing people to change their lifestyle or take their medicines, as a score that is not zero implies that the blockage process is starting, and likely will progress unless lifestyle changes are made. It is important to realize that calcification is a function of age, and in younger people (men under 50, women under 60) the calcium score is less helpful when low. ''A more elaborate modality is CT ''angiography'' (ultrafast CT). This is a non-invasive (no catheter involved) form of ''angiogram'', but still involves dye exposure and ''radiation'', and is less precise than a ''coronary angiogram''. This is still a rather new modality, and its role is still being defined.'  "
What is the most accurate method of defining coronary heart disease?,"'The ""gold standard"" for the evaluation of coronary heart disease remains the coronary angiogram. ''Coronary angiography'' can be used to identify the exact location and severity of coronary heart disease; it is described below.' "
Coronary angiography,"'During a coronary angiogram (also termed a coronary catheterization), a small catheter (a thin hollow tube with a diameter of 2-3 mm) is inserted through the skin into an artery usually in either the groin or the arm. Guided with the assistance of a fluoroscope (a special X-ray viewing instrument), the catheter is then advanced to the opening of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart. Next, a small amount of radiographic contrast (a solution containing ''iodine'', which is easily visualized with X-ray images) is injected into each coronary artery. The images that are produced are called the angiogram. ''Angiographic images accurately reveal the extent and severity of all coronary arterial blockages. Coronary angiography is performed with the use of local anesthesia and intravenous sedation, and is generally not terribly uncomfortable. The procedure takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes. After the procedure, the catheter is removed and the artery in the leg or arm is sutured, ""sealed,"" or treated with manual compression to prevent bleeding. There is a small risk of serious complications from coronary angiography, as it is an ""invasive"" test, but in the hands of experienced physicians, this risk is quite small (well below one per cent). In appropriate patients, the therapeutic information learned from the angiogram is far more valuable than the relatively small risk of the procedure.''For patients with severe ''angina'' or heart attack (''myocardial infarction''), or those who have markedly abnormal noninvasive tests for coronary heart disease, the angiogram also helps the doctor select the optimal treatment, which may include medications, ''balloon angioplasty'', coronary ''stent'' placement, or ''coronary bypass'' surgery. The coronary angiogram is the only test which allows the precise quantification of the extent and severity of coronary heart disease to optimally make these treatment decisions.' "
Conclusions,"'For the purpose of screening for coronary heart disease, each person should discuss their particular coronary heart disease ""risk factor profile"" with the doctor in order to decide if screening tests are indicated and which test is most appropriate. The doctor will have detailed information regarding what testing involves and the implications of the results for each individual.' "
What is radiation therapy?,"'In radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy), invisible high-energy rays or beams of subatomic particles are used to damage ''cancer'' cells and can stop them from growing and dividing. This ultimately can kill the ''cancer'' cells treated with radiation. A specialist in radiation therapy is called a radiation oncologist.' "
What are the types of radiation therapy?,"'External radiation therapy is usually given on an outpatient basis in a hospital or clinic with specialized equipment 5 days a week for a number of weeks. Patients are not radioactive during or after the treatment with external beam radiation therapy.''For internal radiation therapy, the patient often stays in the hospital for a few days. The implant may be temporary or permanent. Because the level of radiation is highest during the hospital stay, patients may not be able to have visitors or may have visitors only for a short time. Once an implant is removed, there is no radioactivity in the body. The amount of radiation given off to the outside from a permanent implant goes down to a safe level before the patient leaves the hospital.'   Like surgery, radiation therapy can be a local treatment; it affects cancer cells only in the treated area. If the area treated is broader, we say it is then a regional treatment. Rarely, the whole body is given radiation therapy for a systemic or total-body effect. Radiation can come from a machine (external radiation). It can also come from an implant (a small container of radioactive material) placed (either temporarily or permanently) directly into or near the tumor (internal or interstitial radiation). Some patients receive both kinds of radiation therapy."
What are the side effects of radiation therapy?,"'With radiation therapy, the side effects depend on the treatment dose and the part of the body that is treated. The most common side effects are:''Radiation therapy can cause inflammation of tissues and organs in and around the body site radiated.''Radiation therapy can also cause a decrease in the number of white blood cells, which help protect the body against infection. Today radiation therapy using modern types of equipment can be better focused and thereby result in fewer side effects.''Although the side effects of radiation therapy can be unpleasant, they can usually be treated or controlled. It also helps to know that, in most cases, they are not permanent. Again, the possible side effects of radiation therapy depend on the location and the amount of radiation.'   tiredness and skin reactions (such as a rash or redness, permanent pigmentation, and scarring) in the treated area. This can cause symptoms that depend on what organs are affected and to what degree. For example, radiation can inflame skin to cause a burn or permanent pigmentation. It can also irritate the colon and cause diarrhea."
EPA Recommends for Radon,"'''Radon is estimated to cause thousands of ''lung cancer'' deaths in the U.S. each year.''* Radon is estimated to cause about 21,000 lung ''cancer'' deaths per year, according to '""EPA's 2003 Assessment of Risks from Radon in Homes (EPA 402-R-03-003)""'. The numbers of deaths from other causes are taken from the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'""'s 2005-2006 National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Report and 2006 National Safety Council Reports."" Test your home for radon - it's easy and inexpensive. Fix your home if your radon level is 4 picocuries per liter, or pCi/L, or higher. Radon levels less than 4 pCi/L still pose a risk, and in many cases may be reduced."
Overview of Radon,"'Radon is a ''cancer''-causing, radioactive gas.'""You can't see radon. And you can't smell it or taste it. But it may be a problem in your home.""""Radon is estimated to cause many thousands of deaths each year. That's because when you breathe air containing radon, you can get lung ""'cancer''. In fact, the Surgeon General has warned that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States today. Only ''smoking'' causes more lung cancer deaths. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.''''Radon can be found all over the U.S.''Radon comes from the natural (radioactive) breakdown of uranium in soil, rock and water and gets into the air you breathe. Radon can be found all over the U.S. It can get into any type of building - homes, offices, and schools - and result in a high indoor radon level. But you and your family are most likely to get your greatest exposure at home, where you spend most of your time.You should test for radon.''Testing is the only way to know if you and your family are at risk from radon. EPA and the Surgeon General recommend testing all homes below the third floor for radon. EPA also recommends testing in schools.''Testing is inexpensive and easy - it should only take a few minutes of your time. Millions of Americans have already tested their homes for radon (see How to Test Your Home).''You can fix a radon problem.''Radon reduction systems work and they are not too costly. Some radon reduction systems can reduce radon levels in your home by up to 99%. Even very high levels can be reduced to acceptable levels.''New homes can be built with radon-resistant features.'""Radon-resistant construction techniques can be effective in preventing radon entry. When installed properly and completely, these simple and inexpensive techniques can help reduce indoor radon levels in homes. In addition, installing them at the time of construction makes it easier and less expensive to reduce radon levels further if these passive techniques don't reduce radon levels to below 4 pCi/L. Every new home should be tested after occupancy, even if it was built radon-resistant. If radon levels are still in excess of 4 pCi/L, the passive system should be activated by having a qualified mitigator install a vent fan. For more explanation of radon resistant construction techniques, refer to EPA publication, Building Radon Out: A Step-by-Step Guide on How to Build Radon-Resistant Homes (PDF) (84 pp., 5.5 M)."" "
How Does Radon Get Into Your Home?,"'Radon is a radioactive gas. It comes from the natural decay of uranium that is found in nearly all soils. It typically moves up through the ground to the air above and into your home through cracks and other holes in the foundation. Your home traps radon inside, where it can build up. Any home may have a radon problem. This means new and old homes, well-sealed and drafty homes, and homes with or without basements.''Radon from soil gas is the main cause of radon problems. Sometimes radon enters the home through well water (see ""Radon in Water"" below). In a small number of homes, the building materials can give off radon, too. However, building materials rarely cause radon problems by themselves.''Radon Gets In Through:''Nearly 1 out of every 15 homes in the U.S. is estimated to have elevated radon levels. Elevated levels of radon gas have been found in homes in your state. Contact your state radon office for general information about radon in your area. While radon problems may be more common in some areas, any home may have a problem. The only way to know about your home is to test.''Radon can also be a problem in schools and workplaces. Ask your state radon office about radon problems in schools, daycare and childcare facilities, and workplaces in your area.'

How to Test Your Home for Radon,"""You can't see radon, but it's not hard to find out if you have a radon problem in your home. All you need to do is test for radon. Testing is easy and should only take a few minutes of your time.""'The amount of radon in the air is measured in ""picocuries per liter of air,"" or ""pCi/L."" There are many kinds of low-cost ""do-it-yourself"" radon test kits you can get through the mail and in some hardware stores and other retail outlets. If you prefer, or if you are buying or selling a home, you can hire ''a qualified tester'' to do the testing for you. You should first contact your ''state radon office'' about obtaining a list of qualified testers. You can also contact a private radon proficiency program for lists of privately certified radon professionals serving your area.''There are Two General Ways to Test for Radon:Testing is easy and should only take a few minutes of your time.' "
Short-Term Testing for Radon,"'The quickest way to test is with short-term tests. Short-term tests remain in your home for two days to 90 days, depending on the device. ""Charcoal canisters,"" ""alpha track,"" ""electretion chamber,"" ""continuous monitors,"" and ""charcoal liquid scintillation"" detectors are most commonly used for short-term testing. Because radon levels tend to vary from day to day and season to season, a short-term test is less likely than a long-term test to tell you your year-round average radon level. If you need results quickly, however, a short-term test followed by a second short-term test may be used to decide whether to fix your home (see Home Sales).' "
Long-Term Testing for Radon,"'Long-term tests remain in your home for more than 90 days. ""Alpha track"" and ""electret"" detectors are commonly used for this type of testing. A long-term test will give you a reading that is more likely to tell you your home\'s year-round average radon level than a short-term test.''''EPA Recommends the Following Testing Steps:''''Step 1.'' Take a short-term test. If your result is 4 pCi/L or higher, take a follow-up test (Step 2) to be sure.''''Step 2.'' Follow up with either a long-term test or a second short-term test:'""The higher your initial short-term test result, the more certain you can be that you should take a short-term rather than a long-term follow up test. If your first short-term test result is more than twice EPA's 4 pCi/L action level, you should take a second short-term test immediately.""'''Step 3.'' If you followed up with a long-term test: Fix your home if your long-term test result is 4 pCi/L or more. If you followed up with a second short-term test: The higher your short-term results, the more certain you can be that you should fix your home. Consider fixing your home if the average of your first and second test is 4 pCi/L or higher. (see also Home Sales)' For a better understanding of your year-round average radon level, take a long-term test. If you need results quickly, take a second short-term test."
How To Use a Radon Test Kit,"""Follow the instructions that come with your test kit. If you are doing a short-term test, close your windows and outside doors and keep them closed as much as possible during the test. Heating and air-conditioning system fans that re-circulate air may be operated. Do not operate fans or other machines which bring in air from outside. Fans that are part of a radon-reduction system or small exhaust fans operating only for short periods of time may run during the test. If you are doing a short-term test lasting just 2 or 3 days, be sure to close your windows and outside doors at least 12 hours before beginning the test, too. You should not conduct short-term tests lasting just 2 or 3 days during unusually severe storms or periods of unusually high winds. The test kit should be placed in the lowest lived-in level of the home (for example, the basement if it is frequently used, otherwise the first floor). It should be put in a room that is used regularly (like a living room, playroom, den or bedroom) but not your kitchen or bathroom. Place the kit at least 20 inches above the floor in a location where it won't be disturbed - away from drafts, high heat, high humidity, and exterior walls. Leave the kit in place for as long as the package says. Once you've finished the test, reseal the package and send it to the lab specified on the package right away for analysis. You should receive your test results within a few weeks."" "
What Your Test Results for Radon Mean,"'Test your home now and save your results. If you find high radon levels, fix your home before you decide to sell it.''The average indoor radon level is estimated to be about 1.3 pCi/L, and about 0.4 pCi/L of radon is normally found in the outside air. The U.S. Congress has set a long-term goal that indoor radon levels be no more than outdoor levels. While this goal is not yet technologically achievable in all cases, most homes today can be reduced to 2 pCi/L or below.''Sometimes short-term tests are less definitive about whether or not your home is above 4 pCi/L. This can happen when your results are close to 4 pCi/L. For example, if the average of your two short-term test results is 4.1 pCi/L, there is about a 50% chance that your year-round average is somewhat below 4 pCi/L. However, EPA believes that any radon exposure carries some risk - no level of radon is safe. Even radon levels below 4 pCi/L pose some risk, and you can reduce your risk of lung cancer by lowering your radon level.''If your living patterns change and you begin occupying a lower level of your home (such as a basement) you should retest your home on that level.''Even if your test result is below 4 pCi/L, you may want to test again sometime in the future.' "
Radon and Home Sales,"'More and more, home buyers and renters are asking about radon levels before they buy or rent a home. Because real estate sales happen quickly, there is often little time to deal with radon and other issues. The best thing to do is to test for radon NOW and save the results in case the buyer is interested in them. Fix a problem if it exists so it won\'t complicate your home sale. If you are planning to move, read EPA\'s pamphlet ""'""Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon""',"" which addresses some common questions (see also ''Radon in Real Estate''). You can also use the results of two short-term tests done side-by-side (four inches apart) to decide whether to fix your home.''''During home sales:''Today many homes are built to prevent radon from coming in. Building codes in your state or local area may require these radon-resistant construction features. If you are buying or renting a new home, ask the owner or builder if it has radon-resistant features. The EPA recommends building new homes with radon-resistant features in high radon potential (Zone 1) areas. Even if built radon-resistant, every new home should be tested for radon after occupancy. If you have a test result of 4 pCi/L or more, consult a ''qualified mitigator'' to estimate the cost of upgrading to an active system by adding a vent fan to reduce the radon level. In an existing home, the cost to install a radon mitigation system is about the same as for other common home repairs. For more information, refer to '""EPA's Map of Radon Zones""' and other useful EPA documents on radon-resistant new construction (see publications). See also '""EPA's Indoor airPLUS new homes certification program""'.' Buyers often ask if a home has been tested, and if elevated levels were reduced. Buyers frequently want tests made by someone who is not involved in the home sale. Your state radon office can assist you in identifying a qualified tester. Buyers might want to know the radon levels in areas of the home (like a basement they plan to finish) that the seller might not otherwise test."
Radon in Water,"""There are two main sources for the radon in your home's indoor air, the soil and the water supply. Compared to radon entering the home through water, radon entering your home through the soil is usually a much larger risk.""'The radon in your water supply poses an ''inhalation'' risk and an ingestion risk. Research has shown that your risk of lung cancer from ''breathing'' radon in air is much larger than your risk of ''stomach cancer'' from swallowing water with radon in it. Most of your risk from radon in water comes from radon released into the air when water is used for showering and other household purposes.'""Radon in your home's water is not usually a problem when its source is surface water. A radon in water problem is more likely when its source is ground water, e.g. a private well or a public water supply system that uses ground water. If you are concerned that radon may be entering your home through the water and your water comes from a public water supply, contact your water supplier.""""If you've tested the air in your home and found a radon problem, and your water comes from a well, have your water tested.""""If you've tested your private well and have a radon in water problem, it can be fixed. Your home's water supply can be treated in two ways. Point-of-entry treatment can effectively remove radon from the water before it enters your home. Point-of-use treatment devices remove radon from your water at the tap, but only treat a small portion of the water you use and are not effective in reducing the risk from breathing radon released into the air from all water used in the home.""""For more information, call EPA's Drinking Water Hotline at (800) 426-4791 or visit www.epa.gov/safewater/radon.html If your water comes from a private well, you can also contact your state radon office.""

How to Lower the Radon Levels in Your Home,"'Since there is no known safe level of radon, there can always be some risk. But the risk can be reduced by lowering the radon level in your home.''There are several proven methods to reduce radon in your home, but the one primarily used is a vent pipe system and fan, which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside. This system, known as a soil suction radon reduction system, does not require major changes to your home. Sealing foundation cracks and other openings makes this kind of system more effective and cost-efficient. Similar systems can also be installed in houses with crawl spaces. Radon contractors can use other methods that may also work in your home. The right system depends on the design of your home and other factors.''Ways to reduce radon in your home are discussed in EPA\'s ""'""Consumer's Guide to Radon Reduction""'."" You can also download a copy from our ''radon publications page''.''The cost of reducing radon in your home depends on how your home was built and the extent of the radon problem. Most homes can be fixed for about the same cost as other common home repairs. The cost to fix can vary widely; consult with your state radon office or get one or more estimates from qualified mitigators. The cost is much less if a passive system was installed during construction.''Lowering high radon levels requires technical knowledge and special skills. You should use a contractor who is trained to fix radon problems. A qualified contractor can study the radon problem in your home and help you pick the right treatment method.''Check with your state radon office for names of qualified or state certified radon contractors in your area.

In addition, it's a good idea to retest your home every two years to be sure radon levels remain low.""'If you are planning any major structural renovation, such as converting an unfinished basement area into living space, it is especially important to test the area for radon before you begin the renovation. If your test results indicate a radon problem, radon-resistant techniques can be inexpensively included as part of the renovation. Because major renovations can change the level of radon in any home, always test again after work is completed.' "
The Risk of Living With Radon,"'Scientists are more certain about radon risks than from most other cancer-causing substances.''Radon gas decays into radioactive particles that can get trapped in your ''lungs'' when you breathe. As they break down further, these particles release small bursts of energy. This can damage lung tissue and lead to lung cancer over the course of your lifetime. Not everyone exposed to elevated levels of radon will develop lung cancer. And the amount of time between exposure and the onset of the disease may be many years.''Like other environmental pollutants, there is some uncertainty about the magnitude of radon health risks. However, we know more about radon risks than risks from most other cancer-causing substances. This is because estimates of radon risks are based on studies of cancer in humans (underground miners).''Children have been reported to have greater risk than adults of certain types of cancer from ''radiation'', but there are currently no conclusive data on whether children are at greater risk than adults from radon.''''Your chances of getting lung cancer from radon depend mostly on:' How much radon is in your home The amount of time you spend in your home Whether you are a smoker or have ever smoked"

What is Ramsay Hunt syndrome? What causes it?," Ramsay Hunt syndrome (also termed Hunt's Syndrome and herpes zoster oticus) is a herpes zoster virus infection of the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. It is caused by reactivation of herpes zoster virus that has previously caused chickenpox in the patient. Ramsay Hunt syndrome results in paralysis of the facial muscles on the same side of the face as the infection. So, the virus infects the facial nerve that normally controls the muscles on one side of the face. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is typically associated with a red rash and blisters (inflamed vesicles or tiny water-filled sacks in the skin) in or around the ear and eardrum and sometimes on the roof of the mouth or tongue."
What are the signs and symptoms of Ramsay Hunt syndrome?,"'The classic symptom that clinically distinguishes Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a red painful ''rash'' associated with blisters in the ears and facial paralysis (for example, ''eyelid'' or mouth) on one side of the face. Other symptoms are:\xa0'   ear pain, hearing loss, dizziness (or vertigo), dry eye, and changes in taste sensation may also occur."
How do medical professionals diagnose Ramsay Hunt syndrome?,"'Diagnosis of the syndrome is most often made by observing the symptoms described above (red painful rash with ear and or mouth blisters and one-sided facial paralysis). Also, a ''PCR'' test (''polymerase chain reaction'') can be performed on the fluid from the blisters to demonstrate the viral genetic material, but this test is not done routinely.' "
Is Ramsay Hunt syndrome contagious?,"'The syndrome is not ''contagious''; however, the herpes zoster virus that can be found in the blisters of Ramsay Hunt syndrome can be transmitted to other people and cause ''chickenpox'' in those who are unvaccinated against chickenpox and who have never had chickenpox. Individuals with Ramsay Hunt syndrome should avoid contact with newborns, ''pregnant'' women, immunodepressed individuals, and people with no history of chickenpox, at least until all the blisters change to scabs.' "
How does Ramsay Hunt syndrome compare with Bell's palsy?,"""Bell's palsy also is a result of injury to the facial nerve by a viral infection, but the suspected viral cause of Bell's palsy has not been identified. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by the ""'Varicella'' virus (Herpes zoster) that also causes chickenpox and ''shingles'' (a painful, ''blister'""-producing Herpes zoster reinfection that usually occurs on one side of the body). There is no red rash associated with Bell's palsy as there is with Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Additionally, Ramsay Hunt syndrome is commonly more painful than Bell's palsy. However, both can cause eyelid and mouth paralysis on one side of the face.""'Dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclona is a rare degenerative disease of the nerves characterized by ''epilepsy'', ''muscle spasms'', and gradually increasing ''tremors'"". Like Bell's palsy, this disease complex mimics many symptoms of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Some investigators term the disease complex Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2."" "
What are treatments for Ramsay Hunt syndrome? Is it possible to prevent it?,"'Treatment consists of antiviral agents (for example, ''acyclovir'', ''valacyclovir'' or ''famciclovir'') for about one week, steroids (''prednisone''), and ''pain'' medications. Best results are reported when treatment protocols are started within three days after symptoms appear. Early treatment usually results in a better prognosis (see below). For children, the varicella ''vaccine'' can reduce the chance of getting chickenpox from which the syndrome comes (reactivation of the virus). However, once a person gets chickenpox, the person is susceptible to reactivation of the virus and thus can develop ''shingles'' and/or Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Fortunately, there is another vaccine, ''Zostavax'', which is helpful in preventing viral reactivation. Consequently, ''shingles'' and Ramsay Hunt syndrome can be either prevented or their symptoms reduced if the vaccine is administered. Usually, this vaccine is given to individuals that have had chickenpox as children and are now age 60 or older. The CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'') suggests the vaccine be routinely given to individuals aged 60 or older, as about 90% of the population has been exposed to chickenpox and about 20% of people that had chickenpox are likely to get ''shingles'' without the vaccine.'  "
What is the prognosis for patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome?,"""The prognosis for Ramsay Hunt syndrome is not as good as that for Bell's palsy. There is good clinical evidence to suggest that treatment with steroids, pain medications, and antiviral agents (like acyclovir, valacyclovir or famciclovir) improve recovery and lessen the extreme facial discomfort. However, infrequent complications can develop, such as synkinesis (inappropriate nerve responses such as blinking or tear formation while trying to talk), eye damage, or rarely, viral spread to other nerves causing many other problems (for example, pain, ""'confusion'', ''weakness''). ''Postherpetic neuralgia'' (pain due to nerve ''fiber'' damage by the virus) may also develop and persist for months to years.'  "
Rape (Sexual Assault) Facts," Sexual assault is any illegal sexual contact that involves forcing a person without their consent or inflicting such contact with someone who is unable to give consent due to age or physical or mental capabilities. Sexual assault may also involve sexual contact that is inflicted by someone who is trusted by or has authority over the victim. Sexual harassment is defined as unwanted sexual behavior that interferes with the victim's work or school life. Sexual battery refers to contact with an intimate body part of another person that is unwanted by the victim and is done in order for the perpetrator to achieve sexual arousal, gratification, or abuse. Any sexual assault that involves inflicting physical injury or maiming of the victim is described as being aggravated sexual assault. Rape is unlawful sexual activity involving sexual intercourse that happens by force or under the threat of some form of harm. Rape occurs in a variety of contexts, as in childhood marriage, as a form of torture and is sometimes perpetrated by members of the military on their own colleagues. States tend to legally define first-, second-, and third-degree rape and sexual assault based on the age of the victim and the perpetrator, and/or the amount of force, brutality, and threat inflicted on the victim. Unfortunately, rape is grossly underreported to law enforcement. A majority of victims of sexual victimization indicate that the perpetrator is known to them, like an acquaintance as in date rape, or by a family member or friend. Signs and symptoms of someone who has been sexually assaulted or raped tend to include a variety of emotional, behavioral, social, and work-related problems. Some ways to prevent sexual assault and rape are to lessen the life risk factors for being the victim or perpetrator of these crimes. If left untreated, the physical and psychological effects of sexual assault and rape can be devastating, sometimes even deadly. The primary consideration for caring for victims of rape or other sexual assault is to focus on the needs of the victim during this crisis, providing timely, appropriate medical, mental health, and legal assessment and care by specially trained and experienced professionals in a timely manner."
What Is Sexual Assault?,"'Sexual assault is defined as any illegal sexual contact that involves forcing a person without their consent or inflicting such contact on someone who is unable to give consent due to their age or to physical or mental incapacities. Sexual assault may also involve sexual contact that is inflicted by someone who is trusted by or has authority over the victim. Incest is one example of childhood sexual abuse that is perpetrated by a trusted person who often has authority over the victim, as when a parent or sibling engages in such a violation on another family member.'""Sexual harassment is defined as unwanted sexual behavior that interferes with the victim's work or school life. It does not include behaviors that are wanted or welcome, like desired flirting, kissing, or touching. Unfortunately, sexual assault and sexual harassment take place in a variety of settings. The most common site where young women report sexual harassment is at school, including on college campuses. The workplace is another site of sexual harassment. While the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunities Commission received 6,862 complaints of sexual harassment in the workplace in 2014, many more individuals feel they have been the victim of such unwanted behavior but have not reported it. More than 17.5% of workplace sexual harassment charges in 2014 were filed by men.""'Sexual battery refers to contact with an intimate body part of another person that is unwanted by the victim and is done in order for the perpetrator to achieve sexual arousal, gratification, or abuse. It may occur whether or not the victim is wearing clothes or not. Any sexual assault that involves inflicting physical injury or maiming of the victim is described as being aggravated sexual assault.''In 2011, there were 8,763 allegations of sexual victimization of inmates in prison, jails, and other adult correctional facilities. Most sexual assaults that take place during incarceration are homosexual rapes, in that the perpetrator and the victim are of the same gender. Detention and other incarceration is often the setting for rape or other sexual assault for boys and men.' "
What Is Rape?,"'The definition of rape is unlawful sexual activity involving sexual intercourse that happens by force or under the threat of harm. It is important to note that the threat of harm may take many different forms, like the threat of physical harm, loss of employment, reputation, or social status. Other facts about this form of sexual violation include that about 15% of women and 3% of men over 17 years of age report being raped at some time during their lifetime. About 10% of rapes are committed by more than one attacker. Rape occurs in a variety of contexts. It takes place in some societies in the form of childhood marriage, is used to torture and demoralize others in times of war, and is sometimes perpetrated by members of the military on their own colleagues.''States tend to legally define first-, second-, and third-degree rape and sexual assault based on the age of the victim and the perpetrator, and/or the amount of force, brutality, and threat inflicted on the victim. Unfortunately, rape is grossly underreported to law enforcement. The approximately 92,000 reported cases of rape each year reflect only a portion of the actual number of rapes that occur. Individuals of all races, religions, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic levels can be the victim of rape. While women of Native American/Alaskan and of mixed race apparently report being sexually assaulted at higher rates than women of other races, it is unknown if that is because it is reported at higher rates or actually indicates a higher rate of sexual victimization for individuals in those ethnic groups.''A majority of victims of sexual victimization indicate that the perpetrator is known to them, like an acquaintance as in date rape, or by a family member or friend. More than 7% of women and about 0.3% of men are the victim of marital rape or rape by a former spouse, current or former partner they live with, or by a date at some time in their life. Men who perpetrate spousal rape tend to be motivated by having a position of power in their marriage, to minimize or deny their abusive actions, and to use their children to manipulate their wife and impose male privilege.''Women on college campuses are at more risk than other women, in that about one in five college women are the victim of rape during their college career. Most sexual assaults occur in private areas like a home, hotel, or vehicle rather than in a public place. When rape is committed against a person who is under a certain age, it is called statutory rape.' "
What Are the Symptoms and Signs of Someone who Has Been Sexually Assaulted or Raped?,"'Signs and symptoms of someone who has been sexually assaulted or raped tend to include ''depression'', guilt, anger, and ''anxiety''. Behaviorally, the victim of sexual violence might become aggressive, abuse substances, or break rules, like not attending work or school. The victim might also have sleeping or eating problems, withdrawal from relationships, or intrinsic sexual problems.' "
What Can I Do to Prevent Sexual Assault and Rape?,"'Some ways to prevent sexual assault and rape are to lessen the life risk factors for being the victim or perpetrator of these crimes. While risk factors such as being less than 15 years old and being in a married or cohabitating relationship are not amenable to change, refraining from the use of ''drugs'' or ''alcohol'' and decreasing the number of sexual partners may help decrease the vulnerability to sexual victimization. The fact that perpetrators of rape or other sexual assault are often drunk or intoxicated with another substance at the time of the assault indicates that such offenses are frequently facilitated by ''substance abuse''. While increased female empowerment sometimes places women at increased risk for spousal sexual violence, helping women improve their socioeconomic status or to achieving careers outside of sex work (for example, in prostitution, adult entertainment, or what many interpret to be other forms of sexual exploitation) may decrease their risk for rape or other forms of sexual assault.''Factors that tend to decrease the likelihood that men will engage in committing a rape include individual issues such as refraining from the use of drugs or alcohol, exercising good impulse control, and having good perceptions of women (e.g. family factors such as having a supportive family and absence of ''domestic violence''). Community factors such as low crime rates in general and having strong laws against sexual violence can also mitigate male-instigated sexual violence.' "
What Do I Do if Someone I Know or I Have Been Sexually Assaulted or Raped?,"'The primary consideration in caring for a victim of rape or sexual assault has to do with the needs of the victim during this crisis. Any intervention tends to be more effective when sensitively administered in a timely way so that the survivor of a rape or other sexual assault will not be subjected to more questioning or other interactions than are necessary. The primary issues addressed include medical treatment of any injuries, the collection of evidence, ''prevention'' of unwanted ''pregnancy'' and ''sexually transmitted diseases'', and the provision of psychosocial support. In addition to the prevention of ''pain'' or other symptoms of injuries or a ''sexually transmitted disease'', appropriate medical interventions include protection against unwanted pregnancy and the consideration of abortion. Psychosocially, it is important to reassure the victim of this ''trauma'' that their victimization is in no way their fault. This is true no matter how old they are, what they do for a living, or whether or not they have ever had a rape dream or fantasy. All that matters is that unwanted sexual contact was inflicted upon them. It is noteworthy that both male and female rape victims tend to prefer being evaluated by a woman.''The sooner a victim of rape or other sexual assault gets medical and mental-health assessment and treatment, the more likely they are to recover from the trauma. Therefore, if you or someone you know has been sexually violated in any way, timely care should be sought from your nearest emergency room or rape crisis center. In either setting, victims of sexual assault or rape are medically and mentally assessed by a doctor or nurse examiner. The medical evaluation usually includes a full physical examination, including a ''pelvic exam''. It also typically involves lab tests, including testing for sexually transmitted diseases. While a physical examination, particularly a pelvic examination, can be disturbing to someone who has been sexually assaulted or raped, trained professionals are usually able to help survivors feel more comfortable through skilled assessment and reassurance. Specifically, the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANE) has specially trained professionals in how to help victims of rape or sexual assault go through this process at their own pace and to participate in the attempted prosecution of the perpetrator if and when the victim feels he or she is able to do so. In fact, survivors of such violence have been found to report their victimization to the authorities more often when provided with SANE-trained professionals.''As the number of times as well as the number of perpetrators of rape, sexual assault, and sexual abuse has a significant impact on the victim, examiners will usually inquire about whether the victim was raped, abused, or assaulted by their mother, father, sister, brother, or other family member. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) is a federal statute that allows survivors of sexual victimization to receive a medical exam either free of charge or to be fully reimbursed for the assessment and does not require that the assault be reported to the police, charges be filed against the perpetrator, or other cooperation with the criminal justice system unless the victim so chooses. Therefore, cost or fears about reporting the crime should not deter a victim of rape or other sexual assault from getting care. In addition to attempting to provide a comprehensive response to rape and other sexual assault, the VAWA supports such a response to domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking by enhancing victim services. In addition, knowing that rape shield laws prevent the identity of survivors of this trauma from being revealed may be of some comfort to victims of rape or sexual assault.' "
What Are the Physical and Psychological Effects of Sexual Assault and Rape?,"'If left untreated, the physical and psychological effects of sexual assault and rape can be devastating, sometimes even deadly. ''Causes of death'' as the result of sexual violence include ''suicide'', murder, and infection with the ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (''HIV''). The murder of sexual assault and rape victims may be perpetrated by the rapist or as part of an honor killing by family members of the victim. The victim of a rape or other sexual assault might become ''pregnant'' as a result of the rape. He or she could develop ''nightmares'', flashbacks, changes in their ''sleep'' and appetite, or full-blown emotional problems, such as ''post-traumatic stress disorder'', ''depression'', or substance abuse. Individuals who have experienced sexual assault are at risk for other day-to-day problems, including interpersonal problems with family members or work colleagues.' "

Why is identification of streptococcal infection important?,"'Patients benefit both immediately and potentially in the long-term by rapid confirmation of ''streptococcal'' cause of their sore throat. Antibiotic treatment provides a quicker reduction of symptoms, shortens the duration of illness and quickly, and efficiently eliminates the possibility of spread of infection to others. ' Although rare, serious consequences of
	streptococcal infections do 
occur. Rheumatic fever is associated with
	heart, 
	joint and nervous 
system damage and is preventable by rapid treatment of strep disease.  Serious kidney disease that may result in 
	kidney failure may also be a consequence of 
	streptococcal infection.  A throat infection due to strep needs antibiotic 
therapy initiated as 
rapidly as possible. The rapid strep test facilitates this goal."
Why is the rapid test better?,"'By comparison with culture methods, a rapid strep test is much quicker and can produce results within minutes.' "
What is the traditional test for strep throat?,'The traditional test for a strep throat has been a throat culture. The major drawback of a throat culture is that the results take two to three days due to the time necessary to allow enough GAS bacteria to grow to enable accurate identification.' 
What is a rapid strep test?,"""The rapid strep test is a quick and accurate diagnostic tool used to determine whether or not strep bacteria are present in the patient's throat. The same test may be used to evaluate for the presence of ""'Streptococci'' in other infected areas (for example, perianal infection in either gender, or vulvar infection in pre-pubertal girls).'  "
How is a rapid strep test done?,"'Obtaining a specimen is the same whether your doctor will do a throat culture or rapid test for strep. A cotton swab (similar to a Q-tip) is quickly rubbed over both ''tonsils'' as well as the back wall of the mouth (the posterior pharynx). It is important to avoid contact with other structures inside the mouth such as the tongue or cheeks. The swab is then placed in a specialized container and the rapid test performed. Many people find that obtaining the swab produces a gagging sensation. However, since the entire swabbing process lasts less than five seconds this inconvenience is minimal.' "
What are the limitations of the rapid strep test?,"'There are several manufactures of rapid strep tests. Each manufacturer has designed their test to respond only to the presence of the particular ''streptococcal'' bacteria (Group A) responsible for strep throat. Other bacteria which are less much less likely to cause sore throats are not identified by the rapid strep test. ' The test will not 
detect viral causes of sore throat.  A positive test response occurs when a 
reaction occurs between a protein on the surface of strep bacteria and chemicals in the 
test materials. Either living or dead strep bacteria will produce a 
positive reaction.  Most rapid strep tests have a
	sensitivity of 95%, meaning that 
the test will be positive in 95 of 100 patients who are documented to have strep 
throat via throat culture obtained at the same time. Since 5 of 100 patients 
with strep throat will be missed using a rapid strep test, all negative swab 
specimens should be sent for culture to confirm the absence of strep bacteria. 
	 A 
positive culture requires antibiotics.  The rapid strep test has a 98%
	specificity. This 
means that 98 of 100 positive tests correctly indicate the 
presence specifically of Group A streptococcus bacteria; 2 of 100 positive 
results are ""false positives"" - indicative of similarities between various surface
	proteins found on strep bacteria and other non-strep bacteria found in the 
mouth."
"What are the causes, symptoms, and signs of common types of noninfectious rashes?","'Some common, noninfectious rashes are listed and described on the following pages.

COVID-19 coronavirus rashes,"'Skin rashes are now being associated with coronavirus ''COVID-19'' infections. Similar to other viral diseases such as ''HIV'' and bacterial diseases like ''syphilis'', COVID-19 rashes can take many different forms. One study from Spain identified five different patterns of COVID-19 rash. The most common type was a ""macropapular rash."" These rashes feature both small, flat discolorations (""macules"") and small, elevated lesions (""papule""). These rashes are associated with more severe COVID-19 infection, as 2% of those who got them in the Spain study reportedly died from the illness. Other rashes associated with COVID-19 include thickened lesions developing on the heels of the ''feet'', lesions that resemble ''chickenpox'', and rashes that resemble those seen with ''dengue fever''.''Some dermatologists have reported cases of so-called ""COVID toe"" in both adults and children. These lesions may be reddish, elevated lesions that flatten after about a week. Some of the patients found their COVID toe rashes ''itchy'', and others did not. Some found it painful when their toes were pressed, and others did not. More research is needed, as some of the rashes reported in COVID-19 patients resemble drug reactions. For safety reasons, researchers have been unable to determine if ''drug interactions'' are responsible in these cases, or whether the novel coronavirus itself causes these rashes.' "
Atopic dermatitis,"'Atopic dermatitis'', often called ''eczema'', is a common disorder of childhood that produces red ''itchy'', weeping rashes on the inner aspects of the elbows and in back of the knees as well as the cheeks, neck, wrists, and ankles. It is commonly found in patients who also have ''asthma'' and/or ''hay fever''.' "
Seborrheic dermatitis,"'Seborrheic dermatitis is the single most common rash affecting adults. It produces a red scaling often itchy eruption that characteristically affects the ''scalp'', forehead, brows, cheeks, and external ears. In infants, it may involve and scalp (''cradle cap'') and ''diaper'' area.' "
Contact dermatitis,"'Contact dermatitis is a rash that is brought on either by contact with a specific chemical to which the patient is uniquely ''allergic'' or with a substance that directly irritates the skin. Some chemicals are both irritants and allergens. This rash tends to be weepy and oozy and affects the parts of the skin which have come in direct contact with the offending substance. Common examples of ''allergic contact dermatitis'' are ''poison ivy'', ''poison sumac'', ''poison oak'' (same chemical, different plant) and reactions to costume jewelry containing nickel.' "
Diaper rash,'This is a common type of ''irritant contact dermatitis'' that occurs in most infants and some adults who wear diapers when feces and urine are in contact with skin for too long.' 
Stasis dermatitis,"'This is a weepy, oozy dermatitis that occurs on the lower legs of individuals who have chronic swelling because of poor circulation in veins.' "
Psoriasis,"'This bumpy scaling eruption which does not weep or ooze. ''Psoriasis'' tends to occur on the scalp, elbows, and knees. The skin condition produces silvery flakes of skin that scale and fall off.' "
Hives,"'These red itchy ''bumps'' come on in a sudden fashion and then resolve in about eight hours. They tend to recur frequently. If hives are caused by a drug, that drug should be avoided in the future.' "
Nummular eczema,"'This is a weepy, oozy dermatitis that tends to occur as coin-shaped plaques in the wintertime and is associated with very ''dry skin''.' "
Drug eruptions,"'Certain ''drugs'' (like antibiotics) can produce a skin rash as an unwanted side effect. The common appearance is similar to rashes produced by certain common viral infections. On the other hand, drugs may produce a wide variety of other types of rashes.' "
Heat rash (miliaria),"'This skin eruption is caused by the occlusion of sweat ducts during hot, humid weather. It can occur at any age but is most common in infants who are kept too warm. ''Heat rash'' looks like a red cluster of ''acne'' or small ''blisters''. It is more likely to occur on the neck and upper chest, in the groin, under the breasts, and in elbow creases. Treatment involves moving the individual to a cooler environment.''Rashes not caused by infectious organisms, can be treated with ''over-the-counter'' 1% hydrocortisone cream for a week or so prior to seeking medical attention. Over-the-counter oral ''antihistamines'' like ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') or ''hydroxyzine'' (''Vistaril'', Atarax) can be helpful in controlling the ''itching'' sensation.' "
What health care professionals diagnose and treat rashes?,"'Dermatologists, pediatricians, infectious diseases specialists, and many internists are capable of identifying most rashes.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose common skin rashes?,"'The term ''rash'' has no precise meaning but often is used to refer to a wide variety of red skin eruptions. A rash is any inflammatory condition of the skin. Dermatologists have developed various terms to describe skin rashes. The first requirement is to identify a primary, most frequent feature. The configuration of the rash is then described using adjectives such as ""circular,"" ""ring-shaped,"" ""linear,"" and ""snake-like."" Other characteristics of the rash that are noted include density, color, size, consistency, tenderness, shape, and even temperature. Finally, the distribution of the rash on the body can be very useful in diagnosis since many skin diseases have a predilection to appear in certain body areas. Although certain findings may be a very dramatic component of the skin disorder, they may be of limited value in producing an accurate diagnosis. These include findings such as ulcers, scaling, and scabbing. Using this framework, it is often possible to develop a list, called a differential diagnosis, of the possible diseases to be considered. An accurate diagnosis of a skin rash often requires a doctor or other health care professional. On the basis of the differential diagnosis, specific laboratory tests and procedures can be conducted to identify the cause of a particular rash.'  "
Rashes produced by fungal infections,"'Fungal infections'' are fairly common. Yeasts are botanically related to fungi and can cause skin rashes. These tend to affect folds of skin (like the skin under the breasts or the groin). They look fiery red and have pustules (blisters) around the edges.''Fungus and yeast infections have little to do with hygiene -- clean people get them, as well. Fungal rashes are not commonly acquired from ''dogs'' or other animals. They seem to be most easily acquired in gyms, showers, pools, or locker rooms, or from other family members. Many effective antifungal creams can be bought at the drugstore without a prescription, including 1% ''clotrimazole'' (Lotrimin, Mycelex) and 1% ''terbinafine'' (''Lamisil''). With extensive infection, or when toenails are involved, a prescription drug may be useful, such as oral terbinafine.''If a fungus has been repeatedly treated without success, it is worthwhile considering the possibility that it was never really a fungus to start with but rather a form of ''eczema''. ''Eczema'' is treated entirely differently. A fungal infection can be independently confirmed by performing a variety of simple tests.' "
Rashes produced by bacterial infections,"'The most common ''bacterial infections'' of the skin are ''folliculitis'' and ''impetigo''. ''Staph'' or ''strep'' germs may cause ''folliculitis'' and/or ''impetigo'', two conditions that are much more common in children than adults. Eruptions caused by bacteria are often pustular (the bumps are topped by pus) or may be plaque-like and quite painful (such as with ''cellulitis''). Rarely, streptococcal ''sore throat'' can produce ''scarlet fever'', a rash affecting large areas of skin. Rashes produced by certain classes of bacteria, ''Rickettsia'' or spirochetes, ''Rocky Mountain spotted fever'', and secondary ''syphilis'' respectively, are often able to be suspected clinically.' "
Rash due to parasites,"'One of the most common rashes from a parasite infection is ''scabies''. ''Scabies'' is produced by a small ''mite'' (related to a spider). This mite is usually contracted by prolonged contact with another infected individual. The mite lives in the superficial layers of human skin. It does not produce symptoms until the host becomes allergic to it, which occurs about three weeks after the initial infection. It can resemble eczema. ''Bedbugs'' cause a series of eruptions where they pierce the skin.' "
Viral exanthems,"'Rashes that characteristically occur as part of certain viral infections are called exanthems. Many rashes from ''viruses'' are more often symmetrical and affect the skin surface all over the body, including ''roseola'' and ''measles''. Sometimes certain viral rashes are localized to the cheeks, such as parvovirus infections (''fifth disease''). Other viral infections, including ''herpes'' or ''shingles'', are mostly localized to one part of the body. Patients with such rashes may or may not have other symptoms like ''coughing'', ''sneezing'', localized burning, or stomach upset (''nausea''). Viral rashes usually last a few days to two weeks and resolve on their own.' "
What is the treatment for a rash?,"'Most rashes are not dangerous. Many rashes last a while and get better on their own. It is therefore not unreasonable to treat symptoms like itchy and/or ''dry skin'' for a few days to see whether the condition gets milder and goes away.''Nonprescription (over-the-counter) remedies include the following:''If these measures do not help, or if the rash persists or becomes more widespread, a consultation with a general physician or dermatologist is advisable.''There are many, many other types of rashes that we have not covered in this article. So, it is especially important, if you have any questions about the cause or medical treatment of a rash, to contact your doctor. This article, as the title indicates, is just an introduction to common skin rashes.''People with ''atopic dermatitis'' or eczema should not be vaccinated against ''smallpox'', whether or not the condition is active. Patients with ''atopic dermatitis'' are more susceptible to having the virus spread on their skin, which can lead to a serious, even life-threatening condition called ''eczema vaccinatum''. In the case of other rashes, the risk of medical complications is much less. Consult your doctor about the ''smallpox vaccine''.'   Anti-itch creams containing 1% hydrocortisone cream can be effective Oral antihistamines like diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine can be helpful in controlling the itching. Moisturizing lotions Fungal infections are best treated with topical antifungal medications that contain clotrimazole (Lotrimin), miconazole (Micatin), or terbinafine (Lamisil)."
What is the prognosis for a rash?,"'The prognosis depends on the cause of the rash. An accurate identification is, therefore, of great importance in predicting its resolution.' "
Is it possible to prevent rashes?,"'If the cause of a particular rash is known it can be avoided. For example: a ''measles'' vaccination would be of great benefit in preventing the rash of measles, as well more serious consequences of measles infections.' "
What is heat rash?,"""The skin's job is to protect the inside of the body from the outside world. It acts as a preventive barrier against intruders that cause infection, chemicals, or ultraviolet light from invading or damaging the body. It also plays an important role in the body's temperature control. One way that the body cools itself is by ""'sweating'', and allowing that sweat or ''perspiration'' to evaporate. Sweat is manufactured in sweat glands that line the entire body (except for a few small spots like fingernails, toenails, and the ear canal).''Sweat glands are located in the dermis or deep layer of the skin, and are regulated by the temperature control centers in the brain. Sweat from the gland gets to the surface of the skin by a duct.'""A heat rash occurs when sweat ducts become clogged and the sweat cannot get to the surface of the skin. Instead, it becomes trapped beneath the skin's surface causing a mild inflammation or rash.""'Heat rash is also called prickly heat or miliaria.'  "
What are the causes of heat rash?,"'It is uncertain why some people get heat ''rashes'"" and others don't.""'The sweat gland ducts can become blocked if ''excessive sweating'' occurs, and that sweat is not allowed to evaporate from a specific area. Some examples of how blockage may occur include the following:''Babies'"" have immature sweat glands that aren't able to efficiently remove the sweat they produce. They can develop heat rash if they are exposed to warm weather, are overdressed, excessively bundled, or have a ""'fever''.''Heat rash may occur as a side effect of some medications (for example ''clonidine'' [''Catapres'']).'   Creases in the skin like the neck, armpit, or groin have skin touching adjacent skin, which makes it difficult for air to circulate, and prevents sweat evaporation. Tight clothing that prevents sweat evaporation. Bundling up in heavy clothing or sheets. This may occur when a person tries to keep warm in wintertime or when chilled because of an illness with fever. Heavy creams or lotions can clog sweat ducts."
What are the symptoms of heat rash in children and adults?,"'The common symptoms of heat rash are red ''bumps'' on the skin, and an ''itchy'' or prickly feeling to the skin. These are due to inflammation of the superficial layers of the skin (the ''epidermis'') and the prickly sensation is similar to the feeling of mild ''sunburn''.''The symptoms of heat rash are the same in infants and adults; however, since an infant cannot complain about the rash sensation, he or she may be fussy.'  "
Who is at risk for heat rash?,"'Newborns, infants, the elderly, and ''obese'' individuals with large areas with skin-on-skin contact areas (for example, a large overlapping area of ''abdominal fat'') are at risk for developing heat rash. They all are especially at risk if they are immobile for long periods and parts of the skin aren\'t exposed to circulating air, which results in the inability of the sweat ducts to ""breathe"" (evaporative cooling).''Heat ''rashes'' are more common in places with hot, humid, climates because people sweat more.''Intense ''exercise'' associated with lots of ''sweating'' may cause a heat rash, especially if the clothing worn does not allow adequate air circulation.' "
What does heat rash look like?,"'The appearance of the heat rash depends upon where the excess sweat is deposited in the skin.''Tiny blisters that look like small beads of sweat are seen if the sweat is blocked at the most superficial layers of the skin where the sweat duct opens on the skin surface. Called ''miliaria crystallina'', it has no symptoms other than these ""sweat bubbles.""''Classic heat rash or ''miliaria rubra'"" occurs if the sweat causes inflammation in the deeper layers of the epidermis. Like any other inflammation, the area becomes red (and therefore the name rubra = red) and the blisters become slightly larger. Because the sweat ducts are blocked and don't deliver sweat to the skin's surface, the area involved is dry and can be irritated, itchy, and sore. This rash is also called ""'prickly heat''.''Less commonly, after repeated episodes of prickly heat, the heat rash may inflame the deeper layer of the skin called the dermis, and cause ''miliaria profunda''. This rash is made up of larger, harder bumps that are more skin colored. The rash begins almost immediately after ''exercise'', and again no sweat can be found on the affected areas. Rarely, this type of heat rash may be potentially dangerous if enough skin is involved, since the lack of sweating can lead to heat-related illnesses like ''heat cramps'', ''heat exhaustion'', or ''heat stroke''.' "

How is heat rash diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of heat rash is made by physical examination. Knowing that the rash appears during sweating or heat, appreciating the location on the body (in skin creases or where clothes fit tightly) and seeing what the rash looks like is enough to make the diagnosis. As with many rashes, the health care professional may look at the involved skin and because of previous experience, immediately make the diagnosis.' "
What is the treatment for heat rash?,'Treatment for heat rash include home remedies such as ''over-the-counter'' creams and sprays. Medical treatment for heat rash may involve antibiotics if the sweat glands become infected.'  
Home remedies for heat rash,"'Heat rash often resolves on its own when the skin cools. If the prickly sensation persists, ''calamine lotion'' may be helpful. Some clinicians also recommend over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams or sprays.'  "
Medical treatment for heat rash,"'Heat rash resolves on its own once the skin cools, but on occasion, the sweat glands can become infected. The signs of infection include ''pain'', increased swelling, and redness that does not resolve. Pustules may form at the site of the rash. This infection occurs because bacteria have invaded the blocked sweat gland. Antibiotic treatment may be required. Chronic and recurrent heat rash may need to be treated by a health care professional or dermatologist (skin specialist).' "
How can heat rash be prevented?,"'Prevention'' is the most important treatment for heat rash. By allowing the skin to be exposed to circulating air, the potential for sweat ducts to become blocked and the glands to become inflamed decreases.''Other strategies to prevent heat rash include:' Avoid exercising in hot, humid weather Wear loose clothing made of breathable fabrics like cotton Use air conditioning Keep the skin clean with frequent baths or showers to prevent sweat glands from becoming clogged Reduce the amount of overlapping skin-on-skin (fat or weight loss)"
How effective are electric fans in preventing heat rash?,"'Keeping the skin cool on hot days is an important preventive measure. Air circulation (with fans or by other methods) usually will help with skin cooling. It is important not to bundle newborns and infants too tightly so that air can get to the skin, but it also is important to keep them warm enough.''It is important to move individuals who are immobile (for example, some elderly, those with ''paralysis'', or are weak) so all parts of the body can be exposed to fresh air.' "
How can people protect their health when temperatures are extremely high?,"'The body can adapt very well in hot weather, but it takes time to acclimate. The actual temperature is just one factor when a person decides to work, play, or exercise in the heat. The ''heat index ''adds humidity to the equation since sweat cannot evaporate if the water content in the air (humidity) is high. If the air holds as much water as it can there is no place for sweat to go, and evaporation cannot cool the body.''To minimize the risk of heat-related illnesses, try to avoid working or exercising in extreme heat. Avoid ''dehydration'' and other complications by taking frequent breaks to get out of the heat, and drinking plenty of water or other fluids to replenish fluid lost through sweat.''Early signs of heat-related illnesses include ''lightheadedness'', ''weakness'', and ''nausea''. It is important to get out of the heat, cool off, and rehydrate immediately to avoid severe heat-related problems such as heat exhaustion and heat ''stroke''.'""To calculate the heat index in your area,\xa0 go to the U.S. Army's Heat Index Calculator online."" "
How much water should I drink in hot weather?,"'It is hard to gauge how much water is lost through sweat, and the ''thirst'' mechanism may not be sensitive enough to remind a person to drink enough. In general, the kidneys are a good guide to whether there is enough water in the body. If the body is dehydrated, the kidneys will try to hold on to as much water as possible. Decreased urine production, urine concentrated in color, and a strong ''urine odor'"" are signs that the kidneys are trying to conserve the body's water supply. Urine is clear when there is enough fluid in the body.""'In a hot environment, a person should drink enough water to make the urine clear, and make sure the body is producing sweat. Sweat and urine loss also involves ''electrolyte'' loss. Although drinking water is good, other fluids such as sports ''drinks'' should also be consumed to replace lost ''electrolytes'' to avoid other problems like ''hypokalemia'' (''low potassium''). People that are taking medications for conditions such as ''diabetes'', kidney problems, and ''congestive heart failure'' (''CHF'') need to be especially careful about their fluid intake, and discuss how to avoid hot-weather related problems with their doctor(s).' "
Should I take salt tablets during hot weather?,"'Taking salt tablets is not a good idea. While the body loses many electrolytes when it sweats, there are mechanisms in place to compensate for the loss. Usually, keeping the body hydrated with plain water is adequate but does not resupply electrolytes. Sports drinks (for example, PowerAde, Gatorade) may be reasonable alternatives if prolonged exercise or work is required in hot conditions.' "
What is the best clothing for hot weather or a heat wave?,"""Evaporation works to cool the skin only if the sweat that the body produces is allowed to evaporate. Lightweight, loose clothing allows air circulation to the body's surface and helps promote cooling. While cotton is the classic fabric that can be used, some synthetic fabrics have been developed to wick sweat from the skin, which allows the skin to be more efficient at skin or body cooling."" "
What is the prognosis for heat rash?,"'Heat rash or prickly heat tends to be selflimiting, and gets better once the skin cools and is allowed to breathe. Prevention by not allowing heat to accumulate in body areas, followed by cooling the skin are the most common ways to obtain the best prognosis for heat rash.' "
What is Angiostrongylus cantonensis?,'Angiostrongylus cantonensis'' is a parasitic worm of rats. It is also called the rat lungworm. The adult form of the parasite is found only in rodents. Infected rats pass larvae of the parasite in their feces. Snails and slugs get infected by ingesting the larvae. These larvae mature in snails and slugs but do not become adult worms. The life cycle is completed when rats eat infected snails or slugs and the larvae further mature to become adult worms.'  
Can people get infected with this parasite?,"'Yes. People can get infected, under unusual circumstances. However, even if infected, most people recover fully without treatment.' "
How can people get infected?,"'People can get infected by eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs that are infected with this parasite. In some cultures, snails are commonly eaten. Some children, in particular, have gotten infected by swallowing snails/slugs ""on a dare."" People also can get infected by accident, by eating raw produce (such as lettuce) that contains a small snail or slug or part of one.''Certain animals such freshwater shrimp, crabs, or frogs, have been found to be infected with larvae of the parasite. It is possible that eating undercooked or raw animals that are infected could result in people becoming infected, though the evidence for this is not as clear as for eating infected snails and slugs. Of note, fish do not spread this parasite.' "
Can an infected person infect other people?,'No.' 
In what parts of the world have people become infected with this parasite?,"'In many parts, but most of the known cases of infection have been in parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. Some have been in other areas of the world, such as in the Caribbean and Africa.' "
Have cases of this infection occurred in the United States?,"'Yes. Cases have occurred in Hawaii (and other Pacific Islands). Very few cases have been reported in the continental United States. In 1993, a boy in New Orleans got infected by swallowing a raw snail ""on a dare."" The type of snail he swallowed isn\'t known. He became ill a few weeks later, with muscle aches, ''headache'', stiff neck, a slight ''fever'', and ''vomiting''. His symptoms went away in about 2 weeks, without treatment of the infection.' "
Can giant African land snails be infected with this parasite?,"""Yes. This type of snail, which can grow larger than a person's hand, is just one of many types that can be infected. But snails can be infected only if they have ingested contaminated rat feces. We don't know if any of the giant African land snails in the continental United States are infected."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of infection with this parasite?,"""Some infected people don't have any symptoms -- or have only mild symptoms that don't last very long. Sometimes the infection causes a rare type of meningitis (eosinophilic meningitis). The symptoms can include ""'headache'', stiff neck, tingling or painful feelings in the skin, low-grade fever, ''nausea'', and vomiting.' "
What should I do if I think I might be infected with this parasite?,"""You should see your health care provider, who will examine you and ask about any symptoms, travel, and exposures you've had (for example, to snails/slugs). You might have some blood tests, as well as tests for meningitis."" "
Does infection with this parasite need to be treated?,"""Usually not. The parasite dies over time, even without treatment. Even people who develop eosinophilic meningitis usually don't need antiparasitics. Sometimes the symptoms of the infection last for several weeks or months, while the body's immune system responds to the dying parasites. The most common types of treatment are for the symptoms of the infection, such as ""'pain'' medication for ''headache'"" or medications to reduce the body's reaction to the parasite, rather than for the infection itself. Patients with severe cases of meningitis may benefit from some other types of treatment."" "
How can I keep from getting infected with this parasite?,"""Don't eat raw or undercooked snails or slugs, frogs or shrimp/prawns. If you handle snails or slugs, wear gloves and wash your hands. Always remember to thoroughly wash fresh produce. When travelling in areas where the parasite is common, avoid eating uncooked vegetables."" "
What is pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum?,'Pectus excavatum is a condition in which the sternum/breastbone or rib cage has an abnormal shape. This produces a caved-in or sunken appearance of the chest.''Pectus carinatum is a ''genetic disorder'' of the chest wall. It happens because of an unusual growth of the rib and breastbone (sternum) cartilage. The bulging gives the chest a bird-like appearance. That is why the condition is sometimes called pigeon breast or pigeon chest.''Both these conditions may be observed in diseases of the connective tissue such as Marfan’s syndrome and Ehlers Danlos syndrome.' 
When is the Ravitch procedure for pectus excavatum used?,'The Ravitch procedure is a surgery to correct severe pectus carinatum and pectus excavatum. The Ravitch procedure for pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum is typically performed on 13- to 22-year-old patients.' 
What happens during the Ravitch procedure?," The Ravitch procedure is performed under general anesthesia. The procedure takes about 90 min.  The Ravitch procedure involves an incision across the chest and the removal of the cartilage that causes the defect.  The covering of the cartilage is preserved. The sternum is then placed in the normal position.  If a patient is being treated for pectus excavatum, a small bar is inserted under the sternum to hold it in the desired position.  The extent of the operation depends upon the severity of the patient’s condition. The cartilage will regenerate over the next four to six weeks, fixing the sternum in position. A small drain may be placed at the operation site to prevent a fluid collection or lung collapsing."
What happens after the Ravitch procedure?," After the Ravitch procedure, the patient may remain hospitalized for three-five days. The length of hospitalization is mainly determined by pain management. There are multiple ways to control the pain.Initially, intravenous (IV) pain medications will be used to control the pain.When the patient is fit to eat orally, oral pain medications will be used. Initially, intravenous (IV) pain medications will be used to control the pain. When the patient is fit to eat orally, oral pain medications will be used. The patient may have activity restrictions to avoid any unnecessary complication.They may need to avoid strenuous activities or sports for several months while the cartilage is growing back. They may need to avoid strenuous activities or sports for several months while the cartilage is growing back. After being discharged from the hospital, the patient may need to follow-up in two-four weeks. For patients treated for pectus excavatum, the bar is removed approximately six months after the procedure."
What are the risks involved in the Ravitch procedure?,"'There are risks with any surgery, including bleeding, infection and problems with anesthesia (''headache'', drowsiness and ''nausea''). Specific risks regarding the Ravitch procedure include' Pain that can last a month or more, Fluid collection under the skin at the surgery site, Fluid around the lungs or a collapsed lung, Bars that move out of place, Damage to the heart or lungs during the surgery and Reoccurrence of pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum."
What is the outcome of the Ravitch procedure?,"'Patients who undergo surgery to correct pectus excavatum with the Ravitch procedure are generally satisfied with the outcome. Although most surgeries for pectus excavatum are performed around the growth spurt at ''puberty'', many adults also have benefitted from pectus excavatum repair.\xa0''Temporarily freezing the nerves to block pain (cryoablation) can help with the recovery and reduce postoperative pain for four-six weeks. Usually, it takes six months or more for a patient to return to all activities they did before the surgery. For approximately six weeks after the surgery, the patient should take all medicines as prescribed by the surgeon.\xa0''Recommended ''breathing'' exercises should be continued until six months to prevent any complications.'

What is Raynaud's phenomenon vs. Raynaud's disease?,"""Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a disorder resulting in vasospasm, a particular series of discolorations of the fingers and/or the toes after exposure to changes in temperature (cold or hot) or emotional events. Most people with RP have a sensitivity to cold. Skin discoloration occurs because an abnormal spasm of the blood vessels causes diminished blood flow to the local tissues. Initially, the digit(s) involved turning white because of the diminished blood flow. The digit(s) then turn blue (""'cyanosis'') because of a prolonged lack of oxygen. Finally, the blood vessels reopen, causing a local ""flushing"" phenomenon, which turns the digit(s) red. This three-phase color sequence (white to blue to red), most often upon exposure to cold temperature, is characteristic of RP.'""Raynaud's phenomenon most frequently affects women, especially in the second, third, or fourth decades of life. People can have Raynaud's phenomenon alone or as a part of other rheumatic diseases. Raynaud's phenomenon in children is essentially identical to Raynaud's phenomenon in adults. ""'When it occurs alone, it is referred to as ""Raynaud\'s disease"" or primary Raynaud\'s phenomenon. When it accompanies other diseases, it is called secondary Raynaud\'s phenomenon.'  "
What causes Raynaud's phenomenon?,"""The causes of primary Raynaud's phenomenon and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon are unknown. Both abnormal nerve control of the blood-vessel diameter and nerve sensitivity to cold exposure have been suspected as being contributing factors. The characteristic color changes of the digits are in part related to initial blood-vessel narrowing due to spasm of the tiny muscles in the wall of the vessels, followed by sudden opening (dilation), as described above. The small arteries of the digits can have microscopic thickness of their inner lining, which also leads to abnormal narrowing of the blood vessels."" "
What are risk factors from Raynaud's phenomenon?,"""Risk factors for Raynaud's phenomenon include injury from ""'frostbite'' and vibrating tools, medications (bleomycin [''Blenoxane'']), ''propranolol'' (''Inderal''), ergotamine), and having rheumatic autoimmune diseases such as ''scleroderma'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'"", Sjögren's syndrome, ""'mixed connective tissue disease'', and ''rheumatoid arthritis''.' "
What conditions have been associated with Raynaud's phenomenon?,"""Raynaud's phenomenon has been seen with a number of conditions, including rheumatic autoimmune diseases (""'scleroderma'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''lupus'', and mixed ''connective tissue disease''), hormone imbalance (''hypothyroidism'' and carcinoid), ''trauma'' (frostbite, vibrating tools), medications (propranolol [Inderal], ''estrogens'' without additional ''progesterone'', bleomycin [Blenoxane] used in ''cancer'' treatment, and ergotamine used for ''headaches''), ''nicotine'', and even rarely with ''cancers''.' "
What are Raynaud's phenomenon symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of RP depend on the severity, frequency, and duration of the blood vessel spasm. Most patients with mild disease only notice skin discoloration upon cold exposure. They may also experience mild tingling and numbness of the involved digit(s) that will disappear once the color returns to normal. When the blood-vessel spasms become more sustained, the sensory nerves become irritated by the lack of oxygen and can cause ''pain'' in the involved digit(s). Rarely, poor oxygen supply to the tissue can cause the tips of the digits to ulcerate. Ulcerated digits can become infected. With continued lack of oxygen, ''gangrene'' of the digits can occur.''Less common areas of the body that can be affected by RP include the nose, ears, and tongue. While these areas rarely develop ulcers, they can be associated with a sensation of numbness and ''pain''.''Patients with secondary RP can also have symptoms related to their underlying diseases. RP is the initial symptom of a majority of patients with scleroderma, a skin and joint disease. Other rheumatic diseases frequently associated with RP include ''lupus'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'"", and Sjögren's syndrome.""  "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose Raynaud's phenomenon?,"'In patients with the characteristic sequence of skin-color changes of the digits upon cold exposure, diagnosing RP is not difficult. Sometimes, certain patterns in the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) adjacent to the fingernails of patients with RP can be seen using a magnifying viewing instrument. Abnormal nail-fold capillary patterns can suggest the possibility of an associated rheumatic condition. There is, however, no single blood test to help the doctor to confirm the diagnosis. The doctor can order certain blood tests (for example, ''sedimentation rate'', ''rheumatoid factor'', antinuclear antibody, ''thyroid hormone'' levels, and protein levels) to exclude associated rheumatic diseases and ''thyroid disorders'"". The doctor can also perform certain maneuvers with the patient's extremities to exclude pinched blood vessels that can produce symptoms that mimic RP, such as in ""'thoracic outlet syndrome''.'""Typically, patients with Raynaud's phenomenon that is a manifestation of a rheumatic disease have elevated blood sedimentation rates and antinuclear antibodies.

What is the treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon?,"""Management of Raynaud's phenomenon involves preventing the spasm of the blood vessels by protecting the fingers and the toes from cold, trauma, and infection. Medications that can aggravate blood vessel spasm should be avoided by patients with RP. In patients with persistent symptoms, medications that dilate the blood vessels can be administered.""""Patients with Raynaud's phenomenon who have no symptoms other than the color changes of extremities may require only home-remedy measures to prevent complications. ""'Prevention'' measures are important in primary and secondary RP regardless of the severity. Simple initial care involves keeping the body warm, especially the extremities. Warm clothing in colder environments is essential. Cotton gloves can be helpful while searching the freezer. Headwear can help the body retain heat by minimizing heat dissipation. Room temperatures should not be too cool. Rubber gloves protect the hands and prevent cooling while washing dishes. Barefoot ''walking'' should be minimized. Compression of the blood vessels by tight-fitting wrist bands, rings, or footwear should be avoided.'""Note: Some energy companies offer some discounts on utility bills for those who suffer from Raynaud's phenomenon because of the additional heating requirements.""'Those with RP should guard their hands and ''feet'' from direct trauma and wounds. Any wounds or infections should be treated early to prevent more serious infections. Avoiding emotional stresses and tools that vibrate the hand may reduce the frequency of attacks. Biofeedback can also help to decrease the severity and frequency of RP in some patients.''Direct and indirect (passive or ''secondhand smoke'') ''smoking'' should be avoided by patients with RP. The chemicals in tobacco smoke can cause blood-vessel constriction and lead to ''atherosclerosis'' (''hardening of the arteries''), which can further impair oxygen supply to the extremities.''Care of the nails must be done carefully to avoid injuring sensitive toes and fingertips. Ulcers on the tips of the digits should be monitored closely by the doctor. These can become infected. Gently applied finger splints are used to protect ulcerated areas. Ointments that open the blood vessels (''nitroglycerin'' ointment) are sometimes used on the sides of severely affected digits to allow increased blood supply and healing.''Patients with persistent or bothersome symptoms may be helped by taking oral medications that open (dilate) blood vessels. (Sometimes these medications are decreased or eliminated when the environment is warmer, such as during summer months.) These include calcium antagonists (or ''calcium channel blockers''), such as\xa0''diltiazem'' (''Cardizem'', Dilacor), ''nicardipine'' (''Cardene''), ''nifedipine'' (''Procardia''), and other medicines used in ''blood pressure'' treatment, such as ''methyldopa'' (''Aldomet'') and ''prazosin'' (''Minipress''). Recent research has shown that the blood-pressure drug ''losartan'' (''Cozaar'', ''Hyzaar'') can reduce the severity of episodes of RP.''Medications that thin the blood, such as low doses of ''aspirin'' or ''dipyridamole'' (''Persantine''), are sometimes helpful.''Some patients with persistent symptoms can benefit by adding a medication called ''pentoxifylline'' (''Trental''), which makes the ''red blood cells'' more pliable and thereby improving circulation.''Severe RP can lead to gangrene and the loss of digits from lack of blood supply. With severe disease, nerve surgery called ""sympathectomy"" is sometimes considered. In this procedure, to prevent blood-vessel spasm, the nerves that stimulate the constriction of the vessels (sympathetic nerves) are surgically interrupted. Usually, this is performed during an operation that is localized to the sides of the base of the fingers at the hand. Through small incisions, the tiny nerves around the blood vessels are stripped away. This procedure is referred to as a digital sympathectomy.'  "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for Raynaud's phenomenon?,"""The outlook for those affected by Raynaud's phenomenon depends on its severity and whether or not there is associated underlying medical illness.

What is Raynaud's phenomenon vs. Raynaud's disease?,"""Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a disorder resulting in vasospasm, a particular series of discolorations of the fingers and/or the toes after exposure to changes in temperature (cold or hot) or emotional events. Most people with RP have a sensitivity to cold. Skin discoloration occurs because an abnormal spasm of the blood vessels causes diminished blood flow to the local tissues. Initially, the digit(s) involved turning white because of the diminished blood flow. The digit(s) then turn blue (""'cyanosis'') because of a prolonged lack of oxygen. Finally, the blood vessels reopen, causing a local ""flushing"" phenomenon, which turns the digit(s) red. This three-phase color sequence (white to blue to red), most often upon exposure to cold temperature, is characteristic of RP.'""Raynaud's phenomenon most frequently affects women, especially in the second, third, or fourth decades of life. People can have Raynaud's phenomenon alone or as a part of other rheumatic diseases. Raynaud's phenomenon in children is essentially identical to Raynaud's phenomenon in adults. ""'When it occurs alone, it is referred to as ""Raynaud\'s disease"" or primary Raynaud\'s phenomenon. When it accompanies other diseases, it is called secondary Raynaud\'s phenomenon.'  "
What causes Raynaud's phenomenon?,"""The causes of primary Raynaud's phenomenon and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon are unknown. Both abnormal nerve control of the blood-vessel diameter and nerve sensitivity to cold exposure have been suspected as being contributing factors. The characteristic color changes of the digits are in part related to initial blood-vessel narrowing due to spasm of the tiny muscles in the wall of the vessels, followed by sudden opening (dilation), as described above. The small arteries of the digits can have microscopic thickness of their inner lining, which also leads to abnormal narrowing of the blood vessels."" "
What are risk factors from Raynaud's phenomenon?,"""Risk factors for Raynaud's phenomenon include injury from ""'frostbite'' and vibrating tools, medications (bleomycin [''Blenoxane'']), ''propranolol'' (''Inderal''), ergotamine), and having rheumatic autoimmune diseases such as ''scleroderma'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'"", Sjögren's syndrome, ""'mixed connective tissue disease'', and ''rheumatoid arthritis''.' "
What conditions have been associated with Raynaud's phenomenon?,"""Raynaud's phenomenon has been seen with a number of conditions, including rheumatic autoimmune diseases (""'scleroderma'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''lupus'', and mixed ''connective tissue disease''), hormone imbalance (''hypothyroidism'' and carcinoid), ''trauma'' (frostbite, vibrating tools), medications (propranolol [Inderal], ''estrogens'' without additional ''progesterone'', bleomycin [Blenoxane] used in ''cancer'' treatment, and ergotamine used for ''headaches''), ''nicotine'', and even rarely with ''cancers''.' "
What are Raynaud's phenomenon symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of RP depend on the severity, frequency, and duration of the blood vessel spasm. Most patients with mild disease only notice skin discoloration upon cold exposure. They may also experience mild tingling and numbness of the involved digit(s) that will disappear once the color returns to normal. When the blood-vessel spasms become more sustained, the sensory nerves become irritated by the lack of oxygen and can cause ''pain'' in the involved digit(s). Rarely, poor oxygen supply to the tissue can cause the tips of the digits to ulcerate. Ulcerated digits can become infected. With continued lack of oxygen, ''gangrene'' of the digits can occur.''Less common areas of the body that can be affected by RP include the nose, ears, and tongue. While these areas rarely develop ulcers, they can be associated with a sensation of numbness and ''pain''.''Patients with secondary RP can also have symptoms related to their underlying diseases. RP is the initial symptom of a majority of patients with scleroderma, a skin and joint disease. Other rheumatic diseases frequently associated with RP include ''lupus'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'"", and Sjögren's syndrome.""  "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose Raynaud's phenomenon?,"'In patients with the characteristic sequence of skin-color changes of the digits upon cold exposure, diagnosing RP is not difficult. Sometimes, certain patterns in the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) adjacent to the fingernails of patients with RP can be seen using a magnifying viewing instrument. Abnormal nail-fold capillary patterns can suggest the possibility of an associated rheumatic condition. There is, however, no single blood test to help the doctor to confirm the diagnosis. The doctor can order certain blood tests (for example, ''sedimentation rate'', ''rheumatoid factor'', antinuclear antibody, ''thyroid hormone'' levels, and protein levels) to exclude associated rheumatic diseases and ''thyroid disorders'"". The doctor can also perform certain maneuvers with the patient's extremities to exclude pinched blood vessels that can produce symptoms that mimic RP, such as in ""'thoracic outlet syndrome''.'""Typically, patients with Raynaud's phenomenon that is a manifestation of a rheumatic disease have elevated blood sedimentation rates and antinuclear antibodies. Furthermore, capillary nail-fold abnormalities can frequently be found as described above."" "
What specialties of doctors treat Raynaud's phenomenon?,"""Doctors who treat Raynaud's phenomenon include general-medicine physicians, family medicine physicians, internists, ""'rheumatologists'', and hand surgeons.' "
What is the treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon?,"""Management of Raynaud's phenomenon involves preventing the spasm of the blood vessels by protecting the fingers and the toes from cold, trauma, and infection. Medications that can aggravate blood vessel spasm should be avoided by patients with RP. In patients with persistent symptoms, medications that dilate the blood vessels can be administered.""""Patients with Raynaud's phenomenon who have no symptoms other than the color changes of extremities may require only home-remedy measures to prevent complications. ""'Prevention'' measures are important in primary and secondary RP regardless of the severity. Simple initial care involves keeping the body warm, especially the extremities. Warm clothing in colder environments is essential. Cotton gloves can be helpful while searching the freezer. Headwear can help the body retain heat by minimizing heat dissipation. Room temperatures should not be too cool. Rubber gloves protect the hands and prevent cooling while washing dishes. Barefoot ''walking'' should be minimized.

Facts you should know about X-rays,"  X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation that can pass through solid objects, including the body. X-rays penetrate different objects more or less according to their density. In medicine, X-rays are used to view images of the bones and other structures in the body. X-rays were first discovered by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, a German physics professor. Roentgen also studied X-rays and their ability to pass through human tissues to produce images of the bones and metals visible on developed film. To obtain an X-ray image of a part of the body, a patient is positioned so the part of the body being X-rayed is between the source of the X-ray and an X-ray detector. As the X-rays pass through the body, images appear in shades of black and white, depending on the type of tissue the X-rays pass through. For example, the calcium in your bones makes them denser, so they absorb more radiation and appear white on X-rays. Thus when a bone is broken (fractured), the fracture line will appear as a dark area within the lighter bone on an X-ray film. Less dense tissue such as muscle or fat absorbs less, and these structures appear in shades of gray on X-ray film. Air absorbs little of the X-rays, so the lungs and any air-filled cavities appear black on an X-ray film. If pneumonia or tumors are present in the lungs, they are denser than the air-filled areas of the lungs and they will appear as whiter spots on X-ray film."
What are uses of X-rays?,"'The most common form of X-ray used is X-ray radiography, which can be used to help detect or diagnose: '  
Bone fractures  Infections (such as pneumonia) Calcifications (like kidney stones or 
vascular calcifications) Some tumors 
Arthritis in joints Bone loss (such as osteoporosis) Dental issues Heart problems (such as 
	congestive heart failure) Blood vessel blockages Digestive problems Foreign objects (such as items 
swallowed by children)"
Is it safe to have X-rays while pregnant or breastfeeding?,"'The risk of side effects of an X-ray while you are ''pregnant'' is extremely minimal, but it is always important to protect the developing fetus from harm. You should always tell your health-care professional if you are or think you may be ''pregnant'' if an X-ray exam is prescribed. ''X-ray examinations of areas of the body including the arms, legs, chest, head, or ''teeth'' do not expose your reproductive organs or your unborn child to a direct X-ray beam. X-rays of the abdomen, stomach, kidneys, lower back, or pelvis can potentially expose an unborn child to the direct X-ray beam. Depending on your condition and the area that needs to be X-rayed, your doctor may cancel or postpone your X-ray exam if you are pregnant. The X-ray exam also may be modified to reduce the radiation. Often the risk of not having a necessary X-ray can be greater than the risk of the radiation. ''It is safe to have X-ray tests while ''breastfeeding''. The radiation does not affect the milk or the baby, and ''breastfeeding'' is safe after a regular X-ray. Mammograms may be more difficult to read in a lactating mother, but women who are breastfeeding can continue to do so even if they need a ''mammogram''. In the case of X-rays used with contrast media, it is safe to breastfeed as long as there is no radioactive isotope used in the contrast. If there is a radioactive isotope used, your doctor may recommend you stop breastfeeding for a short time. Ask your doctor about the contrast agent used and let them know that if you are breastfeeding. ' "
What are the types of X-rays?,"'There are many types of X-rays that are used to diagnose conditions and diseases. The following are examples.' 

Mammography is a type of X-ray radiograph that is used to detect breast 
cancer.  Computed tomography (CT) scans combine X-ray with computer processing to 
create detailed pictures (scans) of cross sections of the body that are combined 
to form a three-dimensional X-ray image.  Fluoroscopy uses X-rays and a fluorescent screen to study moving or real-time 
structures in the body, such as viewing the heart beating. It can also be used 
in combination with swallowed or injected contrast agents to view the digestive 
processes or blood flow. 
	Cardiac angioplasty uses fluoroscopy with a contrast 
agent to guide an internally threaded catheter to help open clogged arteries. 
Fluoroscopy is also used to precisely place instruments in certain locations 
within the body, such as during epidural injections or joint aspirations. Other uses for X-rays and other types of radiation include cancer treatment. 
High-energy radiation in much higher doses than what is used for X-ray imaging 
may be utilized to help destroy cancerous cells and tumors by damaging their 
DNA. "
What are the dangers and risks of X-rays?,"'Radiation does have some risks to consider, but it is also important to remember X-rays can help detect disease or injury at early stages so the ailment can be treated appropriately. Sometimes X-ray testing can be life-saving. ''The risk from X-rays comes from the radiation they produce, which can harm living tissues. This risk is relatively small, but it increases with cumulative exposure. That is, the more you are exposed to radiation over your lifetime, the higher your risk of harm from the radiation. ''There is a slight increased risk of developing ''cancer'' later in life after X-ray exposure. X-rays have also been linked to ''cataracts'' in the eyes and ''skin burns'', but only at extremely high levels of radiation. ''Things that are risk factors for X-ray damage include:''Things you can do to reduce radiation risks from X-rays: ' A higher number of X-ray exams Receiving X-rays at a younger age Being female (women have a slightly 
higher lifetime risk than men for developing radiation-associated cancer) Keep track of your X-ray history and 
make sure your doctors are aware of it Ask your health-care professional if there 
are alternative tests to X-ray exams If you are pregnant or think you may be 
pregnant, tell the X-ray technician or radiologist"
How do I prepare for an X-ray exam?,"'There is no special preparation needed for a regular diagnostic X-ray. You may be asked to strip down and wear a hospital gown, or at least remove clothing on the part of the body that needs to be X-rayed. You may be asked to remove any metal objects such as ''eyeglasses'', jewelry, or watches that may interfere. If you are getting an X-ray with contrast such as barium or ''iodine'', you may be given a liquid to swallow, an injection, or enema with the agent prior to the X-ray. If you are getting an X-ray of your gastrointestinal tract you may be told not to eat or drink anything for 8 or more hours before the procedure so your stomach is empty. Your doctor will tell you if you need to do this.''An X-ray technician will position you on an exam table and give instructions on how you should position your body for the X-ray. You can ask questions if you have them. ' "
How do medical professionals perform an X-ray?,"'The X-ray test works by positioning the part of the body being X-rayed between the source of the X-ray and an X-ray detector (such as a film). You usually will need to lie on a table or stand against a flat surface to ensure your body is in the right place for the X-rays to pass through the body part being examined. You will be asked to stay still so the image will be as clear as possible. This will provide the most accurate image. ''Dental X-rays'' usually involve biting on a piece of film.''A radiology technician will aim the X-ray machine at the body part that needs to be X-rayed, and then they will leave the room or go behind a screen to turn on the machine. The actual X-ray usually only takes a fraction of a second, and you will not feel anything when it occurs.''The radiology technician may return and reposition your body or the X-ray slide to take additional X-rays from multiple angles.''The entire procedure for a regular usually only takes a few minutes. If contrast agents are used, a procedure may take an hour or more.' "
What are the side effects of contrast agents?,"'If contrast agents are used, you may experience some side effects. ''Side effects of barium include: ''Side effects of iodine include: '  Nausea Vomiting Stomach cramps Diarrhea Constipation Allergic reactions (tell your doctor 
immediately if these occur): hives, itching, skin redness, swelling of the 
throat, hoarseness, difficulty breathing or swallowing, agitation, confusion, 
fast heartbeat Nausea  Vomiting  Metallic taste in the mouth  Headache  Itching  Flushing 
 Lightheadedness  Skin rash or hives  Wheezing  Abnormal heart rhythms  High or low 
blood pressure  Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing"
What happens after the X-ray procedure?,"'There are no side effects or after-effects of a regular X-ray and you should be able to return to your normal daily activities immediately. ''If you had an X-ray with contrast, there may be some temporary side effects. Barium may cause your ''stool'' to turn a whitish color, and iodine injections may cause some people to feel sick or develop a ''rash''. Injections given to relax the stomach before an X-ray of that body part may cause temporary ''blurred vision''. You will likely be instructed to drink plenty of fluids after an X-ray with contrast to help your body rid itself of these agents. ' "
When and how will I receive the results of my X-rays?,"'After an X-ray is taken, the image is produced immediately. However, the time it takes to learn the results varies. '""If your X-ray is taken in a doctor's or dentist's office, the doctor or dentist will likely read the X-ray and discuss results with you in the same visit. If your X-ray is taken while you are in a hospital's emergency department, or in-patient in a hospital it will be read by the emergency physician or sent to a radiologist to read. Depending on how busy the hospital is, this can take a few hours. Once read, it will be sent to the physician treating you, who will discuss the findings. ""'Sometimes, you may be sent to an imaging center to have your X-rays taken. Once the X-rays are done, they will be read by a radiologist on staff at the imaging center, and then transmitted to your doctor who ordered the tests. This may take a day or more. Once your doctor receives the results, they will likely call you to discuss the results over the phone or suggest a follow-up visit in office, or they may refer you to another doctor depending on the findings.

What is a complete blood count (CBC) test?,"'The complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most commonly ordered blood tests. The complete blood count is the calculation of the cellular (formed elements) of blood. Special machines that analyze the different components of blood in less than a minute generally determine these calculations.''A major portion of the complete blood count is the measure of the concentration of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the blood.' "
How much does a CBC test cost?,"'The cost for a\xa0complete blood count test or CBC test varies greatly, and can run\xa0from $10.00 up to $2,700 depending on what type of insurance you have, and whether or not you have it.' "
What is the complete blood count test used for?,"'Your doctor may order this test for a variety of reasons. It may be a part of a routine check-up or screening, or as a follow-up test to monitor certain treatments.' It can also be done as a part of an evaluation based on a patient's symptoms and overall health. To diagnose a medical condition: for example, a high WBC count (leukocytosis) may signify an infection somewhere in the body or, less commonly, it may signify an underlying malignancy. A low WBC count (leukopenia) may point toward a bone marrow problem or related to some medications, such as chemotherapy. A doctor may order the test to follow the WBC count in order to monitor the response to treatment for an infection. The components in the differential of the WBC count also have specific functions and if altered, they may provide clues for particular conditions. To monitor a medical condition: a low red blood cell count or low hemoglobin may suggest anemia, which can have many causes. Possible causes of high red blood cell count or hemoglobin (erythrocytosis) may include bone marrow disease or low blood oxygen levels (hypoxia). To monitor a medical treatment: a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) may be the cause of prolonged bleeding or other medical conditions that affect the production of platelets in the bone marrow. Conversely, a high platelet count (thrombocytosis) may point toward a bone marrow problem or severe inflammation."
What does a complete blood count test measure?,"'The complete blood count, or CBC, lists a number of many important values. Typically, it includes the following:''Mean corpuscular volume (MCV):'' is the average volume of a red blood cell. This is a calculated value derived from the hematocrit and red cell count. Normal range may fall between 80 to 100 femtoliters (a fraction of one millionth of a liter).''Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH): ''is the average amount of hemoglobin in the average red cell. This is a calculated value derived from the measurement of hemoglobin and the red cell count. Normal range is 27 to 32 picograms.''Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC): ''is the average concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of red cells.

What are the normal ranges for a complete blood count test?,"'The values generally included:''Red blood cells are the most common cell type in blood and people have millions of them in their blood circulation. They are smaller than white blood cells but larger than platelets.' White blood cell count (WBC) is the number of white blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4,300 and 10,800 cells per cubic millimeter (cmm). This can also be referred to as the leukocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.3 to 10.8 x 109 cells per liter. White blood cell (WBC) differential count. The white blood count is comprised of several different types that are differentiated, or distinguished, based on their size and shape. The cells in a differential count are granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. Red cell count (RBC) signifies the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally from 4.2 to 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 to 5.9 x 1012 cells per liter. Platelet count measures the number of platelets in a volume of blood and usually ranges between 150,000 to 400,000 per cmm."
"What is the function of the red and white blood cells, and platelets?","'The cells in the CBC (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) have unique functions. Generally speaking, white blood cells are an essential part of the immune system and help the body fight infections. Each different component of the white blood cell (the WBC differential) plays a specific role in the immune system.''Red blood cells are essential in transporting oxygen to all the cells in the body to serve their functions. The hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cell is the vehicle for the transportation of oxygen. Platelets are a part of the blood clotting system in the body and help in preventing bleeding.' "

What are the normal ranges for a complete blood count test?,"'The values generally included:''Red blood cells are the most common cell type in blood and people have millions of them in their blood circulation. They are smaller than white blood cells but larger than platelets.' White blood cell count (WBC) is the number of white blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4,300 and 10,800 cells per cubic millimeter (cmm). This can also be referred to as the leukocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.3 to 10.8 x 109 cells per liter. White blood cell (WBC) differential count. The white blood count is comprised of several different types that are differentiated, or distinguished, based on their size and shape. The cells in a differential count are granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. A machine-generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells is called the automated WBC differential. These components can also be counted under the microscope on a glass slide by a trained laboratory technician or a doctor and referred to as the manual WBC differential. Red cell count (RBC) signifies the number of red blood cells in a volume of blood. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is generally from 4.2 to 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 to 5.9 x 1012 cells per liter. Platelet count measures the number of platelets in a volume of blood and usually ranges between 150,000 to 400,000 per cmm."
"What is the function of the red and white blood cells, and platelets?","'The cells in the CBC (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets) have unique functions. Generally speaking, white blood cells are an essential part of the immune system and help the body fight infections. Each different component of the white blood cell (the WBC differential) plays a specific role in the immune system.''Red blood cells are essential in transporting oxygen to all the cells in the body to serve their functions. The hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cell is the vehicle for the transportation of oxygen. Platelets are a part of the blood clotting system in the body and help in preventing bleeding.' "
Facts you should know about reactive arthritis,"   Reactive arthritis involves inflammation of joints due to an infection in another part of your body. The most common triggers are the genital, urinary, or gastrointestinal systems. Reactive arthritis can occur after genital (venereal) infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or enteric infection (dysentery) with Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, or Clostridium difficile. Reactive arthritis shares many features with psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and the arthritis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Reactive arthritis can affect the joints, the spine, the eyes, urinary tract, mouth, colon, and heart. There is no single laboratory test for diagnosing reactive arthritis. The HLA-B27 genetic marker is commonly found in the blood. Treatment of reactive arthritis is directed toward the specific body area(s) inflamed or affected."
What is reactive arthritis?,"'Reactive arthritis is a chronic form of inflammatory\xa0arthritis featuring the following three conditions: (1) inflamed joints, (2) inflammation of the eyes (''conjunctivitis''), and (3) inflammation of the genital, urinary, or gastrointestinal systems.''This form of ''joint inflammation'' is called ""reactive arthritis"" because it is felt to involve an immune system that is ""reacting"" to the presence of ''bacterial infections'"" in the genital, urinary, or gastrointestinal systems. Accordingly, certain people's immune systems are genetically primed to react aberrantly when these areas are exposed to certain bacteria. The aberrant reaction of the immune system leads to spontaneous inflammation in the joints and eyes. This can be confounding to the patient and the doctor when the infection has long passed at the time of presentation with arthritis or eye inflammation.""""Reactive arthritis has, in the past, been referred to as Reiter syndrome (a term that has lost favor because of Dr. Hans Reiter's dubious past, one of enthusiastically embracing Nazi politics and medical abominations). In addition, Reiter syndrome would refer to a specific type of reactive arthritis limiting inflammation to the eyes, urethra, and joints.""'Reactive arthritis most frequently occurs in patients in their 30s or 40s, but it can occur at any age. The form of reactive arthritis that occurs after genital infection (venereal) occurs more frequently in males. The form that develops after bowel infection (dysentery) occurs in equal frequency in males and females.''Reactive arthritis is considered a systemic rheumatic disease. This means it can affect other organs than the joints, causing inflammation in tissues such as the eyes, mouth, skin, kidneys, heart, and ''lungs''. Reactive arthritis shares many features with several other arthritic conditions, such as ''psoriatic arthritis'', ''ankylosing spondylitis'"", and arthritis associated with Crohn's disease and ""'ulcerative colitis''. Each of these arthritic conditions can cause similar disease and inflammation in the spine and other joints, eyes, skin, mouth, and various organs. In view of their similarities and tendency to inflame the spine, these conditions are collectively referred to as ""spondyloarthropathies.""'  "
What causes reactive arthritis?,"'As mentioned, reactive arthritis is felt in part to be genetic. There are certain genetic markers that are far more frequent in patients with reactive arthritis than in the normal population. For example, the HLA-B27 gene is commonly seen in patients with reactive arthritis. Even in patients who have the genetic background that predisposes them to developing reactive arthritis, however, exposure to certain infections seems to be required to trigger the onset of the disease.''Reactive arthritis can occur after venereal infections. The most common bacterium that has been associated with this post-venereal form of reactive arthritis is an organism called ''Chlamydia'' trachomatis''. Reactive arthritis also occurs after infectious dysentery, with bacterial organisms in the bowel, such as ''Salmonella'', '' ''Shigella'', ''Yersinia'', ''Campylobacter'', and ''Clostridium difficile''. Typically, the arthritis develops one to three weeks after the onset of the bacterial infection. Reactive arthritis has also been reported associated with bladder infusions of BCG used for treating ''bladder cancer''.' "
What are reactive arthritis risk factors?," Gender: Reactive arthritis is more frequent in men. Age: It is most frequent in people 20-40 years of age. Hereditary factors: There are inherited genes, such as HLA-B27, that increase the risk for developing reactive arthritis."
What are reactive arthritis symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms of reactive arthritis can be divided into those that affect the joints and those that affect the non-joint areas.''The classic joints that can become inflamed in reactive arthritis are the knees, ankles, and ''feet''. The particular joints involved are usually asymmetric, that is, one side of the body or the other is affected with signs and symptoms, rather than both sides simultaneously. The inflammation leads to ''joint pain'', ''stiffness'', swelling, warmth, and redness. Patients may develop inflammation of entire fingers or toes which can give the appearance of a ""sausage digit."" This feature is also seen in patients with another type of arthritis called ''psoriatic arthritis'' that is associated with ''skin inflammation'' of ''psoriasis''. The arthritis of reactive arthritis can be associated with inflammation of the spine, leading to stiffness and joint\xa0''pain'' in the back or neck (characteristic of all of the spondyloarthropathies, including ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis).''Cartilage can also become inflamed, especially around the breastbone where the ribs meet in the front of the chest; this condition is called ''costochondritis''. Muscles attach to the bones by tendons. In reactive arthritis, the tendon insertion points can become inflamed (''enthesitis''), tender, and painful when exercised. Achilles tendinitis is common with reactive arthritis.''Non-joint areas that become inflamed and cause symptoms of ''pain'' and irritation in patients with reactive arthritis include the eyes (''conjunctivitis''), genitals, urinary tract (urethra, bladder and ''prostate gland''), skin, mouth lining, large bowel, and the ''aorta''.''Inflammation of the white portion of the eye (''conjunctivitis'') and the ''iris'' of the eye (''iritis'') is frequently seen early in reactive arthritis and may be intermittent. When the whites of the eye are inflamed causing conjunctivitis, there may be no pain. When the colored part of the eye (iris) is inflamed, causing iritis and ''uveitis'', it can be very painful and especially worse when looking into bright lights (medically referred to as ''photophobia'').''Urinary tract inflammation commonly involves the urethra, the tube that drains urine from the bladder. This inflammation (''urethritis'') can be associated with burning on urination and/or ''pus drainage'' from the end of the penis. The skin around the penis can become inflamed and peel. The bladder and prostate gland can also become inflamed, leading to an urge to urinate from ''cystitis'' and ''prostatitis'' respectively.''The skin of the palms of the hands and/or the soles of the feet can develop tiny fluid-filled ''blisters'' that sometimes are filled with old blood. The affected skin can peel and may mimic ''psoriasis''. The classic appearance is medically referred to as keratoderma blennorrhagica. Similar inflammation of the tip of the penis can cause irritating ''rash'' in males, referred to as circinate ''balanitis''.''The mouth can develop open sores (ulcerations) on the hard and soft palate and even on the tongue. These may go unnoticed by the patient, as they are often painless. Inflammation of the large bowel (''colitis'') can cause ''diarrhea'' or pus or ''blood in the stool''. Inflammation of the aorta (aortitis) can be seen in a small percentage of patients who have reactive arthritis. It can lead to failure of the ''aortic valve'' of the heart, which can cause ''heart failure''. The electrical conducting pathway of the heart can also become scarred in reactive arthritis, leading to irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) that may require placement of a ''pacemaker'' to regulate the heartbeat.'  "
What tests do health care professionals use to make a diagnosis of reactive arthritis?,"'There is no single lab test used to diagnose reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis is diagnosed based upon recognition of the combination of arthritis with symptoms such as inflammation of the eyes, and the genital, urinary, and/or gastrointestinal systems. The health care professional obtains a medical history to note the time course of possible infection in the genital or urinary tracts, or the bowel. Stiffness and pain are monitored. Inflammatory types of joint problems typically cause more stiffness in the morning. Blood tests such as a ''sedimentation rate'' may be obtained to document the presence of inflammation in the body. The ''rheumatoid factor'', which is typically present in ''rheumatoid arthritis'', is usually negative in reactive arthritis. The HLA-B27 gene marker blood test can be helpful, especially in the diagnosis of patients with spine disease. Other tests may be ordered to eliminate other possible diseases with similar symptoms.''X-rays'' of the spine or other joints can reveal typical changes of inflammation in these areas but generally not until later in the disease. Occasionally, there are areas of unusual calcifications at the points where the tendons attach to the bones, indicating past inflammation in these areas. Those patients with eye inflammation may require ophthalmology evaluation to document the degree of inflammation in the iris. ''Stool'' cultures might be obtained to detect the presence of infections in the bowel. Similarly, ''urinalysis'' and culture of the urine may be necessary to detect bacterial infection in the urinary tract. The prostate gland, which can also be inflamed in a patient with reactive arthritis, may be examined for tenderness.''Sometimes the fluid of the inflamed joint needs to be examined. In this case, a health care professional will use a needle to withdraw fluid from the joint in sterile fashion. The joint fluid will be examined for white blood cells, bacteria (to check for infection), and crystals (to eliminate ''gout'' as a diagnosis).' "
What are reactive arthritis treatment options?,"'Treatment of reactive arthritis is based on where it has become manifest in the body. For joint inflammation, patients are generally initially treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''). These NSAIDs include ''aspirin'', ''indomethacin'' (''Indocin''), ''tolmetin'' (Tolectin), ''sulindac'' (''Clinoril''), ''piroxicam'' (''Feldene''), and others. Among their potential side effects are gastrointestinal irritation, including ulceration and bleeding. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be taken with food to minimize this risk. ''Corticosteroids'', such as ''prednisone'', can be helpful to reduce inflammation and are used in the short-term treatment of inflammation in reactive arthritis. They can be given by mouth or by local injection into the joint. Corticosteroids are also used to decrease tendon inflammation in some forms of tendinitis.''Antibiotics may be prescribed if one still has the infection that triggered reactive arthritis.''Sulfasalazine'' (Azulfidine) has been shown to be effective in some patients with persistent reactive arthritis. Potential side effects of this sulfa-based medication include sulfa ''rash'' reaction and suppression of the bone marrow. Therefore, blood counts are monitored when Azulfidine is used long-term.''For the aggressive inflammation of chronic joint inflammation in reactive arthritis, medications that suppress the immune system, including the disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), are used. Methotrexate can be given orally by injection. It is given on a weekly basis and requires regular monitoring of blood counts and blood ''liver tests'' because of potential toxicity to the bone marrow and ''liver''.''Tumor'' necrosis factor blockers (TNF): The cell protein TNF acts as an inflammatory agent in ''rheumatoid arthritis''. There is some evidence that TNF blockers can also be helpful in reactive arthritis.''Reactive arthritis has been reported in association with ''HIV'' infection (''AIDS'' virus). In this context, immune-suppression medicine is generally avoided because of the potential for worsening the ''HIV'' disease.''Eye inflammation can be alleviated with anti-inflammatory drops. Some patients with severe iritis require local injections of cortisone to prevent damaging inflammation to the eye, which can lead to ''blindness''.''The inflammation around the penis can be helped by cortisone creams (such as ''Topicort''). When bacteria are discovered in the bowel or urine, antibiotics specific for those bacteria are given.''Exercise'' has shown to help people with arthritis. You should have a physical therapist show you specific exercises for your joints.'  "
What is the prognosis of reactive arthritis?,"'The outlook for reactive arthritis is generally very good. Today, there are many effective treatments. The outlook is best when the disease is diagnosed and treated aggressively early on. When a specific cause is identified and eradicated, it is sometimes possible to completely cure reactive arthritis. Complications, such as eye, skin, or prostate disease, can require comanagement with appropriate specialists, including ophthalmologists, dermatologists, and urologists as well as ''rheumatologists''.' "
Is it possible to prevent reactive arthritis?,"'Yes. Reactive arthritis can be prevented, to some extent, by avoiding sexual infection and by storing food properly and cooking it properly.' "
What does the future hold for reactive arthritis?,"'In the future, new medications will be developed that are more specific in the treatment of reactive arthritis. ''Clinical trials'' with long-term antibiotic treatment are under way, and it is possible that these may be especially effective in reactive arthritis that is associated with ''chlamydia'' infection.''The TNF-blockers, such as ''etanercept'' (''Enbrel'') and ''infliximab'' (''Remicade''), have potential for treating severe, resistant reactive arthritis. These drugs may improve both the joint and non-joint areas of inflammation. Further studies of these drugs are under way.''For further information about reactive arthritis, please visit the following site: ''Arthritis Foundation''.''You can also contact:''The Arthritis Foundation''P.O.

Postsurgical fatigue introduction,"'Patients often question why they are so tired after surgery. Many patients think that because they have been ""put to ''sleep'' with anesthesia"" that they should be refreshed and have more energy as they recover from their surgery. However, the tired feeling (''fatigue'') after surgery is the usual situation for most patients and there are some reasons for this outcome.' "
Sleep deficit,"'Some reasons begin even before surgery. For example, many patients have ''anxiety'' about undergoing any type of surgery and find it difficult to ''sleep'', especially right before the date of surgery. Consequently, many patients have a ''sleep'' deficit even before they undergo surgery. This ''sleep'' deficit must be made up so the body triggers ""sleepiness or ''fatigue''"" as a way to pay off this deficit. Anesthetics do not make up for this sleep deficit, so the body still has it after surgery.'  "
Anemia and blood loss,"'One of the consequences of low red blood count (''anemia'') is that the person can have ''fatigue''. If patients have a history of ''anemia'' before surgery, they are already primed to feel tired and sleepy after surgery. Even patients who are not ''anemic'' before surgery may become ''anemic'' during or after surgery because of blood loss during and after the procedure. In addition to feeling fatigued and/or sleepy,\xa0patients who have lost blood may have a tendency to feel weak and/or dizzy when they try to sit up or stand up. Also, they may feel fatigued because they work harder to breathe since the ''anemia'' has decreased oxygen-carrying capacity due to fewer ''red blood cells'"" available to carry oxygen to the body's tissues."" "
Medications,"'During or after surgery, a number of medications may be administered that are used to alter ''blood pressure'' during the procedure. Frequently used ''drugs'' are ''blood pressure'' medications like ''metoprolol'' (''Lopressor'') or diuretics (for example, ''hydrochlorothiazide'') to reduce blood pressure. Side effects of these ''drugs'' include ''fatigue''. After surgery, medications like ''benzodiazepines'' (for example, ''lorazepam'') may be used for sedation and/or ''muscle spasms''. The ''benzodiazepines'' are also used to treat ''insomnia'' and can cause sleepiness. In many individuals, antibiotics are started during or right after the surgical procedure. Some antibiotics -- like ''cephalexin'' (''Keflex''), and ''trimethoprim'' and ''sulfamethoxazole'' (''Bactrim'') -- can cause ''fatigue''.' "
Depression,"'Depression'', both before and after surgery, can produce ''fatigue''. Some patients have fatigue caused by ''anxiety'' about ''pain'' control, surgical outcome, and concerns about new medications, or the need for rehabilitation, cost of care, family situations, and many other problems. Discovering and addressing ''depression'' and ''anxiety'' before and after surgery may help reduce mental fatigue seen in some surgical patients.''Nevertheless, it is possible to reduce some of the fatigue many patients feel after surgical procedures. Keeping blood loss (''anemia'') to a minimum; replacing fluid, ''electrolytes'', and ''minerals'' quickly; avoiding potentially fatigue-inducing medications; and reducing ''stress'"" (both mental and physical) before and after surgery will likely reduce fatigue. Finally, it's likely that after any surgery a person will feel some fatigue. For goodness sake, don't keep a postsurgical patient awake right after surgery with an excessive number of visitors who want to talk! Let the surgical patient rest to reduce fatigue and speed recovery.""  "
Fasting and loss of electrolytes and minerals,"'Before surgery, patients are often advised to fast to avoid problems (for example, ''vomiting'', ''airway'' compromise, aspiration of gastrointestinal contents) during anesthesia and surgery. Fasting is often extended into the short postoperative period. This can result in a reduction or loss of ''electrolytes'' and ''minerals'' that are usually found in foods. Although fluids may be given during the surgery, they mainly supply fluid volume and do not contain all of the minerals and electrolytes that may be lost. For example, loss of sodium can cause drowsiness and muscle ''weakness''. Loss of potassium (''hypokalemia'') can cause irregular heartbeats that can cause fatigue and ''weakness''.' "
Aging and overall health,"'With normal ''aging'' or from an overall decline in health due to progressive medical problems, there is less ability for the body to rapidly heal and to cope with moderately strenuous exercises and/or activities. The result is that individuals become fatigued quicker, and the fatigue usually lasts somewhat longer. Exposure to the ''stress'' of surgery (potentially new drug and/or medications, blood loss and/or anemia, ''electrolyte'' and mineral imbalances plus the new demands for the body to heal the surgical ''trauma'') then adds to the\xa0fatigue after surgery.' "
Exercise and physical stress,"'Exercise'' and other activities such as strenuous work normally cause fatigue because such activity stresses the body. In order to recover, the body triggers a fatigue response so that the person will be encouraged to rest. This is a normal ''stress''-recovery cycle. Undergoing surgery where the body is given medications and traumatized by procedures can cause fatigue as the body enters into the repairing and healing mode.' "
What is pancreas?,"'The pancreas is a six to eight inches long organ situated in the abdomen, behind the stomach. The two main functions of the pancreas are regulating the blood ''sugar'' in the body and helping in the ''digestion'' of food. If the pancreas does not produce enough ''digestive enzymes'', it can cause ''weight loss'' and\xa0''diarrhea''. Abnormal functioning of pancreas affects the ''insulin'' production that can increase the risk of ''diabetes'', due to a rise in blood glucose levels.\xa0' "
What are the reasons for laparoscopic pancreatectomy?,"'Laparoscopic pancreatectomy can be used in the treatment of a number of different conditions which include:' Tumors: Aggressive and nonaggressive tumors such as insulinoma, adenocarcinoma, and cystic tumors.  Severe pancreatitis: For the long-term inflammation of the pancreas, surgery may be necessary. "
What is laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy?,"""Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is the removal of the left part of the pancreas. The procedure is carried out through small incisions in the abdomen, a fine telescope is used to see inside the body (also known as 'keyhole surgery')."" Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is usually done under general anesthesia. The surgeon generally makes about four or five small incisions in the abdomen. A port (nozzle) is inserted into one of the incisions, and carbon dioxide gas is passed through it to inflate the abdomen. This process allows the surgeon to see inside the abdomen more easily. A laparoscope is inserted through another port. The laparoscope looks like a telescope with a light and camera on the end so the surgeon can see inside the abdomen. Surgical instruments are placed in the other small openings and used to remove the portion of the pancreas which contains the disease or tumors. This operation can require many hours to complete because of its complexity. The pancreas is cut out with surgical staplers. The pancreas specimen then is removed from the abdomen by enlarging one of the small incisions. After all, this has been accomplished, the carbon dioxide is released out of the abdomen through the slits, and then these sites are closed with sutures or staples or covered with glue-like bandage and steri-strips."
What are the risks of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy?,"'The primary risks of laparoscopic pancreatectomy include:' Infection of the skin at the site of operation Leakage of pancreatic juice at the surgical site Collection of pus inside the abdomen (intra-abdominal abscess) The intestines slow down/stop working for several days (Postoperative ileus) Small bowel obstruction due to blockage Anesthesia risks like headache, dizziness. Bleeding Peritonitis (inflammation of abdomen)"
How long does it take to recover from a pancreas surgery?,"'Although patients can leave the hospital after a few days or weeks, a full recovery from pancreas surgery can take two months or longer. During the first two months, the patient requires frequent hospital visits to review pathology and surgical reports. Incisions will be examined and staples and tubes will be removed. The doctor will also talk to the patient about ''diet'', bowel functions, and ''pain'' control to ensure recovery.''If a patient is having issues with ''diet'', they may be referred to a clinical nutritionist to help with individual needs. After the first two months of very regular postoperative evaluations, the frequency of follow-up evaluations will be reduced to every three to six months. Depending on the type of resection and the resulting pathology, the patient may undergo regular imaging studies such as ''magnetic resonance imaging'' or computed tomography to check for recurrence of ''cancer''.''Patients may also need to undergo regular blood tests to ensure important indicators like ''tumor'' markers and ''liver function'' tests remain within normal ranges. Most patients who undergo surgery for ''pancreatic cancer'' will also require a course of ''chemotherapy'' after their operation. Chemotherapy does not normally start until six to eight weeks after surgery.' "
What is the spleen and what are its functions?,"""The spleen is an important part of the body's defense (immune) system that is situated under the left rib cage near the stomach. The spleen contains special white\xa0blood cells\xa0that can destroy bacteria. It helps the body fight infections and also removes old ""'red blood cells'"" from the body's circulation."" "
Which patients are considered for splenectomy?,"'The most common disease-related reason for spleen removal is a blood disorder called\xa0''idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura''\xa0(''ITP''). This is a condition in which antibodies target blood platelets. Platelets are needed to help the blood to clot, so a person with ITP is at risk for bleeding. The spleen is involved in making these antibodies and removing the platelets from the blood. Removing the spleen can be done to help treat the condition. Other common conditions in which splenectomy can be performed are:' Patients with a severe injury causing it’s covering to break open or rupture (ruptured spleen can lead to life-threatening internal bleeding).  Patients with spleen cancer and leukemia Diseases that affect blood cells (sickle cell disease)  Rupture in the spleen's artery A blood clot in the spleen's blood vessels Cyst or abscess (collection of pus) in the spleen"
What is laparoscopic splenectomy?,"'A splenectomy is the total or partial surgical removal of the spleen. ''Laparoscopy'' procedure uses smaller surgical ''cuts''. It usually results in less ''pain'', a faster recovery, less risk of infection, small ''scars'', and a shorter hospital stay. Laparoscopic splenectomy has been performed more frequently in recent years, sometimes called keyhole surgery, which is done with smaller\xa0surgical instruments\xa0inserted through very short incisions, with the assistance of a tiny camera and video monitor. Not everyone can have laparoscopic surgery. The method is usually decided by the doctor depending on overall health and the size of the spleen.\xa0' "
How long does it take to recover from a splenectomy?,"'Patients who undergo laparoscopic splenectomy are usually sent home sooner. They are usually placed on intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and ''pain'' killers. It will take about four to six weeks to recover from the procedure. Patients are usually advised not to take bath till the wounds are healed (sponge cleaning is advised). Activities such as exercises, ''walking'', and driving are restricted at least for six weeks.\xa0' "
What organ takes over after spleen removal?,"'After splenectomy, the functions of the spleen are usually taken up by other organs, such as the ''liver'', bone marrow, and ''lymph nodes''. Up to 30% of people have a second spleen (called as accessory spleen), these are usually very small but may grow and function when the main spleen is removed.\xa0Rarely, a piece of the spleen may break off due to severe injury, such as after a car accident. If the spleen is removed, this piece can grow and function.' "
What is the outcome after splenectomy?,"'The outcome of the procedure varies with the underlying disease or the extent of other injuries. Rates of complete recovery from the surgery itself are excellent, in the absence of other severe injuries or medical problems. Studies of patients with ITP show that 80-90% of children achieve spontaneous and complete remission in 2 to 8 weeks. Small percentages develop chronic or persistent ITP however about 60% showed complete remission by 15 years. No deaths in patients older than 15 years have been attributed to ITP.' "
What is an incisional hernia?,"'An\xa0incisional ''hernia''\xa0is a type of\xa0hernia\xa0caused by an incompletely healed surgical ''wound''.\xa0''A hernia is a bulge or protrusion of body tissue or\xa0an organ\xa0through the structure that normally contains it. A hernia usually occurs when an organ or fatty tissue pushes itself through a weak spot in a surrounding area.\xa0''In an\xa0incisional hernia, the intestine pushes through the abdominal wall from the site of previous abdominal surgery. Incision hernia is mostly seen in elderly or\xa0''overweight''\xa0people who are inactive after abdominal surgery.' "
Is incisional hernia serious?," Usually, incisional hernias may occur months or years after an abdominal operation. Initially, the patient may have a small lump or swelling near the site of the scar. This lump usually appears when the patient coughs or strains and then goes away. Over time, it might get bigger and start hurting. Most incisional hernias do not cause any serious problems. In rare cases, parts of the bowel might get trapped in the opening of the hernia, blocking the passage of stool (obstruction) or cutting off the blood supply (strangulation).  Large incisional hernias can also make it difficult for a person to breathe or move normally. The treatment options for incisional hernias are open surgery or minimally invasive surgery.  Minimally invasive surgery is also called keyhole surgery or laparoscopic surgery."
How is laparoscopic incisional hernia repair performed?,"'Laparoscopic incisional hernia repair is usually performed under general anesthesia.\xa0' After administering general anesthesia, patient vital functions are monitored during the procedure.  The surgeon makes three incisions in the skin below the navel (in the inguinal region). The surgeon inflates the abdomen with carbon dioxide. The surgeon inserts the laparoscope through one of the incisions and uses the other incisions for inserting the surgical tools. Guided by the images from the laparoscope the surgeon gently pushes the protruding tissue or intestine back in place. The surgeon then checks for other weak spots, as an inguinal hernia might occur on one side or both sides. In the case of incarcerated or strangulated hernia, the surgeon may remove the hernia sac and repair the area with stitches. The surgeon fixes a mesh in the weak area to prevent the hernia from recurring. The surgeon strengthens the weak spot in the abdominal muscle wall with stitches  The incisions are then closed with sutures. The patient is brought out of anesthesia, administered pain medication, and monitored in the recovery room until vital functions are stable. The procedure usually takes one to two hours to complete"
How long does it take to recover from incisional hernia surgery?,"'Usually, patients can go home on the same day or a day after the laparoscopic ''inguinal hernia'' repair. They resume normal activities within two weeks. In some cases, it may be slightly longer depending on the extent of the procedure and\xa0how long\xa0it took the doctor to\xa0repair\xa0the abdominal wall. Patients will be advised to avoid heavy lifting, ''coughing'', straining, and other strenuous activities.' "
What are the results of incisional hernia repair?,"'The outcome of incisional hernia repair is generally good, particularly with the laparoscopic method. The American College of Surgeons reports that recurrence rates after the first repair of an incisional hernia range from 25–52%. Recurrence is more frequent when conventional surgical wound closure with standard sutures (stitches) is used. Recurrence after open procedures has been shown to be less likely when the mesh is used, although complications, especially infection, have been shown to increase because of the larger abdominal incisions. ''Laparoscopy'' with mesh has shown rates of recurrence as low as 3.4%, with fewer complications as well.' "
What is laparoscopic gastric banding?,"'Laparoscopic ''gastric banding'' is a ''weight loss surgery'' in which the surgeon places a band around the upper part of the stomach. This creates a small pouch to hold food, limiting the amount an individual can eat by making them feel full faster. A doctor can later adjust the band to make food pass more slowly or quickly through the stomach.' "
Who is considered for laparoscopic gastric banding?,"'Laparoscopic gastric banding is not a quick solution for ''obesity''; however, it greatly changes the individual’s lifestyle.''Doctors often use the following\xa0body mass index\xa0(''BMI'') measures to identify people who may be most likely to benefit from weight-loss surgery. A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 25. This procedure may be recommended for the patients who have:' This weight-loss surgery may be an option if an individual is severely obese and has not been able to lose weight through diet and exercise. The person seeking gastric banding should be mentally stable and not be dependent on alcohol or illegal drugs. A BMI of 40 or more. This most often means that men are 100 pounds (45 kg) overweight and women are 80 pounds (36 kg) over their ideal weight. Patients who are suffering from medical conditions due to obesity (sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease)."
How laparoscopic gastric banding is performed?,"'Laparoscopic gastric banding surgery is done under general anesthesia. This procedure usually takes 30 to 60 minutes to complete.\xa0''When an individual eats after having the surgery, the small pouch will fill up quickly. They will feel full after eating just a small amount of food. The food in the small upper pouch will slowly empty into the main part of the stomach.\xa0' The surgeon generally makes one to five small surgical cuts in the abdomen.  Through these small cuts, the surgeon will place a camera and the instruments needed to perform the surgery.  Then, a band, made of special rubber (Silastic rubber), is placed around the upper part of the stomach to separate it from the lower part.  The inside of the band has an inflatable balloon. This allows the band to be adjusted.  The band creates a small pouch with a narrow opening leading into the larger, lower part of the stomach. Patients or doctors can decide to loosen or tighten the band in the future.  This surgery does not involve any cutting or stapling inside the belly. "
What are the complications of laparoscopic gastric banding?,"'The procedure involves the following risk factors:' The gastric band may gradually wear away through the stomach (if this happens, it must be removed) Stomach may slip up through the band (if this happens, the patient may need urgent surgery) Gastritis (inflamed stomach lining), heartburn or stomach ulcers Infection at the surgical site, which may need antibiotics or surgery Injury to the stomach, intestines or other organs during surgery Poor nutrition Scarring inside the belly that may lead to a blockage in the gastrointestinal tract The surgeon may not be able to reach the access port to tighten or loosen the band. The patient would need minor surgery to fix this problem The tubing near the access port can be accidentally punctured during needle access. If this happens, the band cannot be tightened. The patient would need minor surgery to fix this problem. Vomiting from eating more than the stomach pouch can hold Common anesthesia risk (headache, drowsiness, nausea.) "
How long does it take to recover from lap band surgery?,"'The patient can probably go home on the same day after the surgery. Many people can begin their normal activities a couple of days after going home. Most people take a week off from work. Patients are usually on liquids or mashed-up foods for two to three weeks after surgery. By six weeks after surgery, most can eat regular foods.' "

What is a fibula flap transfer?,"'The fibula is a long, thin bone of the outer leg alongside the shinbone. It is sometimes used to harvest bone that can be used in certain reconstructive surgeries of bone. The fibula can be removed without impacting the individual’s ability to walk or bear weight.''Conditions that cause bony defects where fibula bone can be used in repair:''The fibula flap transfer procedure is often the preferred option for repair of these conditions. Before the advent of the fibula flap in the mid-seventies, people with bony defects in their jaw suffered difficulties in chewing, swallowing, and speaking, in addition to cosmetic defects.' Cancer damage to the bone Injuries to bone Birth defects of bone, such as jaw deformity"
Who needs fibula flap surgery?,'People with bony defects may require fibula flap surgery. This surgery may be helpful in the following:' Cancer involving bone Injuries involving the bone Birth defects of bone Dental reconstruction As a part of other cosmetic surgeries
How is fibula flap surgery performed?,"'Fibula flap surgery is generally performed by a ''plastic surgeon'' with the patient under general anesthesia.''The patient may be required to' Undergo blood tests. Undergo imaging studies (CT scan), angiography, etc. Avoid eating and drinking for eight hours before the procedure. Discuss medications that need to be taken before the surgery with the doctor. Discuss allergies and other diseases with the doctor. The anesthesiologist administers general IV anesthesia. They will also monitor the patient’s vital signs during the procedure. The surgeon makes an incision on the leg. A section of the fibula bone (the flap) is removed along with blood vessels. The flap is harvested ensuring that segments of bone remain in the leg to ensure that the patient can walk and bear weight. The leg incision is closed with sutures. The flap is transferred to the prepared site and secured in position with small plates and screws. The surgeon joins the blood vessels in the flap to the blood vessels in the patient’s prepared reception site under a microscope. Suction drains are placed in the neck with sutures. A feeding tube may be placed if needed. The surgeon closes the incisions with sutures. The patient’s vital signs are monitored. The patient is weaned off the anesthesia and painkillers, antibiotics and other required medications are administered. The donor and recipient flap sites are observed for any abnormal swelling, color change or bleeding."
How long is the recovery after fibula flap surgery?,"'Generally, recovery after fibula flap surgery takes three to four weeks and includes 10 to 14 days in the hospital.' The patient may move in a no weight-bearing fashion on the second postoperative day. The splint is removed and the skin graft is assessed on the fifth postoperative day. The patient is then allowed to walk with the help of a walker or other assistive devices. If a skin graft and splint were not used in the surgery, the patient is typically allowed to bear weight on the second postoperative day. The patient is generally asked to visit the doctor one to two weeks after being discharged from the hospital."
Are there any complications with fibula flap surgery?,'The complications with fibula flap surgery are:' Loss of flap Problems connecting the fibula bone with the bone at the receiving site Fistula (an abnormal tunnel or passage that connects the skin to the tissues underneath) Hematoma (swelling of clotted blood under the tissues) Wound rupture Bleeding Pain Nerve injury Scarring Facial asymmetry Infection Ankle instability Swelling
How long does it take for an amputated fingertip to heal?,"'Fingertip injury healing depends on the extent of the injury. Small wounds heal without any treatment in about two to four weeks; However, larger wounds that require surgical treatment can take weeks or months to heal.' "
What is fingertip amputation?,"'Fingertip amputation is the most common form of injuries. An injury, or amputation, involves a sharp cut, smashing injury, a tearing (lacerating) injury, or a combination of all these.''Fingertip amputation can also result from slamming the finger in a door. An amputation can damage the following parts of the finger:''Fingertips are rich in nerve supply and are extremely sensitive. Hence, fingertip amputation should be treated promptly to prevent finger deformity or disability' Skin and soft tissue The bone of the fingertip (phalanx) Nail and underlying nailbed"
What to do if you have a fingertip amputation?,"'In case of a finger injury, you need to take care of the following things:''In case of a severed finger, follow these instructions:' Clean the injury and apply a sterile bandage at the site to minimize the bleeding. Elevate the amputated hand to minimize swelling. Prevent the movement of the affected hand and wrist with a splint. Consult your physician immediately after following these first-aid techniques. Gently clean the severed finger with a sterile saline solution. Cover the finger with a damp, gauze wrap. Put the finger in a water bag. Place the bag in an ice-filled watertight bag."
How is fingertip amputation treated?,"'Before the procedure:''During the procedure:''Fingertip amputations can be repaired using the following techniques:''After the procedure:''The physician prescribes a ''pain reliever'' and antibiotics to prevent infection.''The patient has to perform specific exercises soon after the surgery to strengthen the hand and fingers.''Additional therapies which may promote healing are:' Enlist medical and medication history to the physician. Before the procedure, the physician may give you a numbing injection to reduce pain. The physician will irrigate or wash out the wound to reduce the chance of infection. After irrigation, the physician removes the dead tissue (debridement) to prevent infection. The physician may ask for an X-ray of the injured finger to look for a broken bone. Your physician may prescribe an antibiotic or tetanus shot to prevent infection. Open technique: This technique treats small wounds or injury. The physician places a protective dressing over the wound with cleaning and dressing at regular intervals. Soak the repaired finger in warm water after one week of dressing. Complete healing takes place in three to six weeks. Skin graft: For larger wounds, the physician recommends skin grafting. In this technique, a piece of skin (skin graft) is taken from the prominent part of the palm above the base of the little finger to cover the injury. Reamputation: In this procedure, the physician will clean, smooth, and cover the severed area. V-Y flap (Kutler or Atasoy): A V-shaped flap is taken from the injured finger, moved it over the defected area and sutured it to the nail bed. Volar flap advancement (Moberg): A piece of skin and underlying fat and blood vessels (flap) are taken from the undamaged portion of the injured finger to cover the wound. Bipedicle dorsal flap: A flap with two connecting stalks (pedicles) from the injured finger is moved toward the wound to cover it. Cross finger flap: A flap is taken from an uninjured finger to cover the wound. Thenar flap: A flap is taken from the palm to cover the wound. Heat and massage Applying splints Special compression wrappings to control swelling Activities such as pinching and grasping"
How painful is a finger amputation?,"'As fingertips are rich in nerve supply, they are extremely sensitive; hence, finger amputation is extremely painful. The finger may be sensitive to ''cold'' and heat for a year or more.' "
Why is forceps delivery done?,"'Forceps assisted delivery is indicated in the following:' Prolonged labor: The labor doesn’t progress despite the mother pushing. There are two stages of normal labor. The first stage of labor is characterized by regular contractions and ends with complete dilation of the cervix. It usually lasts between 12 and 20 hours if it’s a woman’s first pregnancy. If not, then it lasts only 7 to 10 hours. The second stage of labor begins with complete dilation of the cervix and ends with the delivery of the baby, which lasts 1-2 hours. The prolonged second stage of labor may require forceps assisted delivery. The prolonged second stage may occur due to:Use of epidural anesthesiaLarge size and inappropriate position of the babySmall birth canalMaternal exhaustion Use of epidural anesthesia Large size and inappropriate position of the baby Small birth canal Maternal exhaustion Maternal exhaustion: When the mother has been continuously pushing, she may lose strength and become exhausted. Hence, forceps can help deliver the baby. Maternal medical conditions: Maternal medical conditions that affect labor and/or decrease her ability to push include:High blood pressureHeart conditionsHistory of strokeNeuromuscular disorders High blood pressure Heart conditions History of stroke Neuromuscular disorders Fetal problems: If the heart rate of the baby drops due to a decline in the oxygen supply, the fetus can go into distress causing irreversible damage to the baby. Hence, forceps delivery can speed up delivery. Abnormal position of the baby’s head: The baby’s head may be positioned abnormally, causing prolonged labor. Forceps may be used to turn the baby’s head to a favorable position. Abnormal positions of the baby’s head include:Head tilted to one sideHead facing to the sideHead facing the front when the mother is lying on her back Head tilted to one side Head facing to the side Head facing the front when the mother is lying on her back"
When can forceps delivery be done?,"'The following criteria must be met to undergo a forceps assisted delivery safely:' The cervix should be completely dilated: If forceps are used when the cervix is not fully dilated, there is a risk of injuring or tearing the cervix, which would then require surgical repair and affect future pregnancies. The position of your baby’s head should be known: The forceps should be placed on the sides of the head. Hence, forceps delivery is less likely to succeed if the baby is facing straight up. The baby’s head must be engaged: The baby’s head should be engaged (fixed), meaning the baby’s head should have entered the pelvic brim or inlet. The success of using forceps increases when the baby’s head is visible at the vaginal opening when the mother is pushing. The membranes must be ruptured: The amniotic membranes must be ruptured (also called water breaking) to perform a forceps delivery. The baby should be able to fit through the birth canal: Sometimes, the baby may be too big for the birth canal, for example in gestational diabetes (diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy). If a forceps assisted delivery is attempted, it would result in serious complications."
When is forceps delivery not done?,"'The doctor may be against a forceps delivery if:' The baby has a condition that affects the strength of their bones, such as osteogenesis imperfecta Bleeding disorders in the baby, such as hemophilia The baby's head has not moved past the midpoint of the birth canal The position of your baby's head is not known The baby's shoulders or arms pass through the birth canal first before the head The baby is too large to fit through the pelvis"
Is forceps delivery safe?,"'A forceps delivery is relatively safe but there are some possible risks for both the mother and baby.''Possible risks to the mother:''Possible, but rare risks to the baby:' Lower genital tract tears Injury to the bladder or bowels Difficulty urinating Uterine rupture Weakening or tearing of the muscles and ligaments supporting your pelvic organs, causing pelvic organs to prolapse (sag downwards) Transient pain due to the episiotomy Minor or major facial injuries due to the forceps Temporary weakness in of the facial muscles due to facial nerve damage (facial palsy) Injuries to the eye Skull fracture Bleeding within the skull Seizures"
Why is a prostate biopsy done?,"'A prostate biopsy is done to screen for ''prostate cancers''. This is to confirm whether ''cancer'' is present, or if a ''prostate cancer'' diagnosis is aggressive. In a prostate biopsy, small samples of the prostate are removed and then observed under the microscope. Doctors usually recommend a biopsy of the ''prostate gland'' based on certain findings.\xa0''A prostate biopsy involves:''A prostate biopsy may be done in several different ways which may include:' If prostate-specific antigen blood test results are higher than the average age If the doctor detects signs of a prostate problem during a digital rectal exam If a biopsy is the only method to confirm the cancer Collecting minute samples of the prostate gland. A computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is also used to guide them through the procedure. A prostate biopsy takes about 10 minutes and is usually done in the doctor’s office. The samples will be sent to a lab and will be looked at under a microscope to see if they contain cancer cells. If cancer is detected in the patient, it will also be assigned a grade. The results are available after one to three days, but it can sometimes take longer. Transrectal method: This is the most common approach. Biopsies are done using a transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) technique. A TRUS prostate biopsy is where the needle goes through the wall of the last part of the gut (rectum). Perineal method: This is done through the skin between the scrotum and the rectum. Transurethral method: This is a type of biopsy done through the urethra using a cystoscope (a flexible tube and viewing device). Transperineal biopsy: The doctor inserts a needle into the prostate through the skin between the testicles and the anus. This area is called the perineum.  Targeted biopsy: The needle is inserted through a template or grid. This is a targeted biopsy, which can target a specific area of the prostate using MRI scans. An advantage of the transperineal biopsy is that it can now be performed under local anesthesia."
What is tubal ligation?,"'Tubal ligation is a type of permanent ''birth control'' method that involves tying off the tubes. During the tubal ligation, the fallopian tubes are cut, tied, or blocked to prevent pregnancy. Blocking the fallopian tubes may prevent traveling of the eggs from the ovaries to the uterus and traveling of sperm up the fallopian tubes to the eggs.''Tubal ligation doesn’t affect the ''menstruation'' cycle. A woman can choose to get tubal ligation at any time, especially after ''childbirth'' or after cesarean delivery.' "
When is tubal ligation indicated?,'Tubal ligation is indicated if:''Tubal ligation is avoided when:' The woman desires permanent sterilization The woman has completed her childbearing age The woman has health risk with pregnancy The woman has the risk of ovarian cancer The decision of sterilization was not voluntary There are gynecological conditions that require a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy Concurrent desired pregnancy The woman has severe heart or lung disease or dysfunction Obesity
What to expect during a tubal ligation?,"'Before the procedure:''Discuss with the physician about your need for sterilization. The physician may instruct you to:''During the procedure:''Tubal ligation can be performed in an outpatient setting. The physician may give general anesthesia to make you ''sleep'' throughout the procedure. The physician makes a cut or two in the abdomen and inflates it with gas. The physician then inserts a long tube or laparoscope through the incision to view the pelvic organs. After identifying the fallopian tubes, the physician with other instruments closes off the fallopian tubes. Finally, the physician closes the cut with ''sutures''. The whole procedure takes about 20-30 minutes.'

What are the complications of tubal ligation?,"'The risks of tubal ligation include:' Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy found outside the uterus) Post-tubal ligation syndrome (rapid decline in progesterone and estrogen) Damage to the nearby organs Failure of the tubal ligation resulting in an unwanted pregnancy Pain, bleeding, or infection at the site of the cut/incision"
How long does it take to recover ankle arthroscopy?,"'After surgery, ''pain'' killers and antibiotics are administered. Patients are usually discharged between one and three days after surgery. Patients are encouraged to walk with support the same or the next day to prevent the formation of ''blood clots''. Physical therapy may begin at the hospital, and the patient would be advised to continue the exercises at home. ''Pain'', swelling, and ''bruising'' due to surgery reduce in two weeks. Most patients can resume their routine activities in 6 to 12 weeks. Recovery and joint strength continue to improve, and the time taken varies with the extent of disease and surgery. Complete recovery after surgery may even take 6 to 12 months, after which patients can resume all high-impact exercises and sports.\xa0' "
What is ankle arthroscopy?,"'Ankle ''arthroscopy'' is a minimally invasive surgical procedure performed by an orthopedic surgeon. It is used to treat disease conditions of the ankle joint. Ankle arthroscopy is performed using a ''fiber''-optic camera called an arthroscope. Arthroscope helps direct visualization of the structures within and around the ankle. It can magnify the structures of the ankle and transmit it to a display monitor. It is less invasive, the incision size is considerably smaller, and the recovery time is shorter than conventional surgical techniques.' "
When is ankle arthroscopy performed?,"'Ankle arthroscopy can be used as a diagnostic procedure and to also treat disorders of the ankle joint. Ankle arthroscopy may be indicated in the following conditions:' Ankle arthritis.  Fractures of the ankle joint. Ankle instabilities due to ligament and tendon injuries. Ankle impingement following bone or soft tissue inflammation, limiting the range of motion of the ankle joint. Arthrofibrosis (formation of scar tissue within the ankle) leading to joint stiffness and pain.  Infection of the joint. Loosening of cartilage, bone, or scar tissue which floats in the joint and is referred to as loose bodies. Damaged cartilage and/or bone in the ankle joint due to injuries.  Synovitis (inflammation of the lining of the ankle joint called synovial tissue). Diagnosis of unexplained ankle symptoms."

The physician makes a small cut over the vagina to expose the involved muscle and tissue. After identifying the muscle and tissues, the physician either sews the muscles and tissues in place or uses a mesh-type material to strengthen the tissues. The physician may remove any tissue weakened by previous surgeries, pregnancies, or age along with extra vaginal lining. The procedure may take about 45 minutes to 2 hours or more. You may experience discomfort in the vagina for 1-2 weeks following the surgery. The physician may place a medicated vaginal packing in the vagina overnight. The catheter stays for 2-6 days to give the bladder more time to function normally. You may notice bloody discharge and/or odor from the vagina for 1-2 weeks.

What is internal hemorrhoid banding?,"'Hemorrhoid'' banding is a simple, painless, and highly effective procedure that involves placing tiny rubber bands around ''hemorrhoids'' to cut off their blood supply. ''Hemorrhoids'', commonly known as ''piles'', are swollen veins located around the anus or in the lower rectum.''Hemorrhoids'' are either internal or external, depending on the location. Internal hemorrhoids are covered with a lining called the mucosa that is insensitive to touch, ''pain'', stretch, or temperature, whereas external hemorrhoids are covered by very sensitive skin.' "

What is an ovarian cyst removal surgery?,"'In ovarian ''cyst'' removal, fluid or gelatinous sacs (''cysts'') from your ovaries are removed. It can be performed by either' Laparotomy (open surgery): An open surgery requires a cut on the belly large enough that the surgeon can check the cyst and surrounding organs and access the ovary. Particularly, if you have large, multiple, or cancerous cysts, this will be recommended. Laparoscopy (key-hole surgery): Two to three small keyholes are made on your belly, and a laparoscope (flexible tube with a camera) is inserted into it. It is more beneficial in terms of recovery and clinical outcome than a laparotomy."
How can I fasten my recovery?," Eat fresh, nutritious, healthy meals that include high-fibrous items such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Every day drink up to 2 L of fluids, mainly water. Keep your wound clean and healthy by changing dressings periodically. Quit smoking to lessen the risk of wound infection and chest problems. Avoid drinking excessive alcohol. Regular exercise and physical activity will build up the strength of your muscles soon. Start with a 10- to 15-minute walk in the morning and afternoon and gradually increase it. Establish a daily routine. Wash or bathe and get dressed every day. Keep a positive outlook and attitude about your disease and healing. Avoid lifting heavy weights or pushing or pulling any heavy objects for a few weeks. Avoid immediate long journeys over four hours because it may increase the chances of blood clotting in your legs. Follow the instructions given by your surgeon."
When should I return to work?," You can return to work within a maximum of four to six weeks after your laparoscopic ovarian cyst removal. If you feel well, then you can go for lighter work or reduce hours of work. If you require standing all day or heavy manual work, you may need longer than others or request to do it in a sitting position. Avoid heavy weight-lifting at work. Practice lifting the object correctly by having your feet slightly apart, bending your knees, and keeping your back straight. You may feel more tired if you have physically demanding work. Take permission from your surgeon or gynecologist before you get back to work or obtain a certificate from the hospital if you advised rest for longer than one week."
What is TRAM flap surgery?,"'TRAM stands for Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous, a muscle, and tissue of the lower abdomen between the waist and pubic bone. TRAM flap surgery uses the flap (graft) from this skin, fat, and the TRAM muscles for ''breast reconstruction''.''Advantages of using TRAM flaps are:' Consistency of the reconstructed breast. No occurrence of rejection of foreign material, since the tissue used is from the patient. Abdominal rejuvenation. Improvement in the reconstructed breast, compared to implants."
Why is TRAM flap surgery done?,'TRAM flap surgery is done for the following conditions:' Patients who have undergone breast removal surgery (mastectomy) as part of breast cancer Asymmetrical breasts Previous failure from implant reconstruction Excess lower abdominal fat and desire for abdominoplasty along with breast reconstruction To maximize or preserve abdominal muscle function To have the maximum possible blood supply to the TRAM tissues

What is the procedure for TRAM flap surgery?,"'The procedure involves three stages:' During the consultation, the patient is informed about the procedure, possible complications, and scarring. The patient usually will undergo lab tests, including a complete blood cell count, electrolytes, urinalysis, and blood typing. The patient can do abdominal exercises to strengthen their muscles before the surgery. The patient is given an enema the day before the surgery. TRAM flap Revisions and nipple reconstruction Nipple and areolar tattoo In the first stage, a flap (mass of tissue used for surgery) is taken from the lower half of the abdomen, shaped in the form of the breast, and used for reconstruction. In the next stage, the nipple is reconstructed and revised using tissues from the same breast or the opposite one. For the finishing process, the nipple is colorized for the natural look and the symmetry of the breast is enhanced. After the surgery, the patient requires hospitalization for three to four days with close observation for the first 24 to 48 hours. The patient should not exert any pressure for two months. The patient must wear a soft bra and should not sleep on the reconstructed breast. The patient requires 6 to 12 weeks to regain prior energy levels and resume normal activities. Exacerbation of back pain may occur. Anesthesia effects may still impact the patient 6 to 12 months after the surgery. It takes a year for the tissues to heal completely and for the scars to fade away."

How is a laparoscopic hysterectomy done?,"'Hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. Laparoscopic hysterectomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure to remove the uterus. The recovery is faster, and post-operative discomfort is minimal with a laparoscopic hysterectomy.''The surgery involves making a few small incisions, about one-half-inch long, on the abdomen. One of these incisions is made over or near the ''belly button'' through which a thin, flexible device with a light and camera source (laparoscope) is\xa0inserted for allowing the surgeon to see the pelvic organs. The image from the laparoscope can be seen on a TV screen during the surgery. Through the other small incisions, specialized surgical instruments are inserted to perform the surgery. The uterus may be removed with or without the removal of the ovaries and/or the cervix (the neck of the uterus).''A laparoscopic hysterectomy may remove the small pieces through the incisions, through a larger incision made in the abdomen, or through the vagina (called a laparoscopic vaginal hysterectomy or ''LAVH'').''A laparoscopic hysterectomy may be done with the help of a robotic machine controlled by the surgeon. This is called a robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy. The outcome is similar to that of the laparoscopic hysterectomy performed without robotic assistance.' "
What are the risks of a laparoscopic hysterectomy?,"'A laparoscopic hysterectomy is usually a safe procedure providing a shorter hospital stay, fewer complications, and faster recovery compared with an abdominal hysterectomy. Generally, patients can return to their normal activities sooner. There are, however, certain risks associated with laparoscopic surgery. The procedure can take longer to perform than abdominal or vaginal surgery, especially when it is a robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy.\xa0''Some of the risks associated with a laparoscopic hysterectomy are as follows:' Complications related to general anesthesia Heavy bleeding Injury to the ureter or bladder Bowel injury Infections Pulmonary embolism (blood clots, especially in the deep veins of the legs, that may travel to the lungs) Damage to the ovaries including ovary failure Vaginal problems Early menopause"
Is umbilical hernia repair major surgery?,"'An ''umbilical hernia'' repair is a relatively routine surgery and takes about 20 to 30 minutes. It can be performed as an open surgery or a minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery. An open surgery might require two to three days of hospitalization, but with a laparoscopic surgery a patient may be able to go home the same day or within 24 hours.' "
How is an umbilical hernia surgery performed?,"'An umbilical ''hernia'' surgery is usually performed by a general surgeon. Depending on the condition of the patient, the surgeon might use one of the three types of anesthesia,''Prior to the surgery the patient' General Local with sedation Regional (spinal injection) Undergoes blood tests and imaging tests. Must not eat or drink 8 hours prior to the procedure. Must check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. Must inform the doctor of any allergies. An anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions during the procedure The surgeon makes one or more incisions in the skin next to the umbilical hernia. The surgeon gently pushes back the protruding intestine and abdominal tissue back in place. The surgeon may cut out dead tissue if it is a strangulated hernia. The surgeon repairs the hole in the abdominal muscle wall with stitches. The surgeon may also use a mesh for support. The incision is then closed with sutures. The patient will be monitored in the recovery room for a few hours."
Is umbilical hernia surgery painful?,"'An umbilical hernia surgery is not painful because the procedure is performed under anesthesia. During recovery there might be ''pain'', which can be managed with painkillers.' "
What is the recovery time for an umbilical hernia surgery?,'Most people can return to normal daily activities within a week or two after an umbilical hernia surgery. They may be advised to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities for about six weeks.' 
What are the risks and complications of an umbilical hernia surgery?,"'An umbilical hernia repair surgery is a relatively safe procedure, but carries a few risks, including:' Anesthetic side effects such as nausea, headache and confusion nausea,  headache and  confusion Wound infection Pneumonia Blood clots Bleeding Fluid collection under the skin (seroma) Hematoma Bowel injury Paralysis of the intestinal muscles (paralytic ileus) Reoccurrence of hernia, which is likelier in patients with the following conditions:ObesityAscitesLiver diseasePrimary hernia repair without meshSmokingConcurrent inguinal hernia repairOther abdominal surgeries Obesity Ascites Liver disease Primary hernia repair without mesh Smoking Concurrent inguinal hernia repair Other abdominal surgeries Postoperative infection"
What is a laparoscopic appendectomy?,"'An ''appendectomy'' is the surgical removal of vermiform ''appendix'', a finger-shaped sac attached to the beginning part of the colon (cecum). The appendix is located in the lower right abdomen.''A laparoscopic ''appendectomy'' is a minimally invasive surgical procedure to remove the appendix.''The surgeon performs the surgery with tiny surgical tools inserted through two tubes (cannulas) into two other tiny incisions.' The laparoscope is a flexible tube fitted with a video camera and light. Inserted through a tiny incision in the abdomen, the laparoscope enables the surgeon to visualize the appendix."
Why is a laparoscopic appendectomy performed?,"'The appendix produces a protein that helps fight infection, however, its presence does not seem vital for an adult. Other parts of the body take over its function when it is removed.''A laparoscopic appendectomy is a common emergency surgery performed when the appendix is inflamed with infection (''appendicitis'') or ruptured. ''Appendicitis'' can result in symptoms such as''Laparoscopic surgery has certain advantages over open surgery such as''The surgeon may decide to convert a laparoscopic surgery into an open one in the following situations:' acute abdominal pain abdominal  swelling tenderness loss of appetite nausea and vomiting constipation or diarrhea painful and/or frequent urination fever shorter hospital stay quicker healing less post-surgery pain less scarring Rupture of appendix Severe and extensive infection or abscess Inability to visualize appendix due to  patient’s obesity scar tissue or adhesions from previous surgery Patients with bleeding disorderssevere pulmonary diseasesheart diseases bleeding disorders severe pulmonary diseases heart diseases"
How is laparoscopic appendectomy performed?,"'A general surgeon performs a laparoscopic appendectomy under general anesthesia.''Preparation''Procedure''An anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions during the surgery.''The surgeon''The patient is brought out of anesthesia, taken to the recovery room, administered pain medication and monitored till vitals are stable.''The removed appendix is sent for testing.' Prior to a laparoscopic appendectomy, the patient Undergoes a physical examination, blood tests, and imaging tests. May be immediately administered medications for pain and nausea, and antibiotics for infection. Must avoid eating or drinking anything 8 hours prior to the surgery when possible. Must check with the surgeon before taking any regular medication. Must inform the surgeon of any medical conditions and allergies, or if pregnant. A catheter may be attached to decompress the bladder. The patient is connected to an IV line. The patient may be intubated for oxygen supply. Makes three small incisions in the stomach wall. Inflates the abdomen with carbon dioxide through a cannula inserted in one of the incisions. Inserts the laparoscope through the second incision. Guided by the images from the laparoscope, finds, excises and removes the appendix using tiny surgical tools inserted into the incisions via the cannulas. Releases the gas in the abdomen through the incisions. Irrigates the area with saline and suctions the fluid. May attach a tube to drain fluids. Closes the incisions with stitches or staples."
What is recovery time for laparoscopic appendectomy?, After a laparoscopic surgery the patient may be discharged the same day or the next day unless there is serious infection. The patient will generally be able to return normal activities within one to three weeks. The patient may have to follow diet restrictions for a few days and avoid strenuous activity.
What are the side effects of a laparoscopic appendectomy?,"'Appendectomy is one of the safest surgical procedures, though it does carry a few risks and complications.''Early complications include the following:''Late complications include:' Anesthetic side effects such asHeadacheNauseaconfusion Headache Nausea confusion Bleeding and blood clots Surgical site infection  Abdominal abscess Injury to nearby organs Formation of fistula (abnormal connection between unconnected parts of the bowel) Abdominal pain and/or swelling Peritonitis (inflammation of the stomach lining) Bowel obstruction Gangrene in the bowel Hernia at the incision Stump appendicitis Recurrent infection in the remaining appendix stump"
What is trigeminal neuralgia surgery?,"'Trigeminal neuralgia'' surgery is a treatment for facial ''nerve pain'' (neuralgia) that is caused by irritation in the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve has three main branches on each side of the face, which combine as a bundle of nerves (Gasserian ''ganglion''). Trigeminal neuralgia surgery is performed to eliminate the irritation in the nerve when medications are not effective.''Surgical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia is of three types:' Microvascular decompression Percutaneous procedures Gamma knife surgery"
Microvascular decompression (MVD) procedure,'MVD is an open surgery performed by a neurosurgeon with the patient under general anesthesia.''The patient may be required to''The anesthesiologist''The neurosurgeon\xa0' Undergo blood tests. Undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) of the brain to evaluate blood vessel malformation or blood vessel impingement on the trigeminal nerve. Avoid eating and drinking for eight hours prior to the procedure. Check with the doctor before taking any regular medication. Inform the doctor of any allergies. Attaches an IV line and administers general anesthesia. The anesthesiologist monitors the patient’s vital signs during the procedure. Makes an incision in the skin behind the ear. Makes a 3-cm opening in the skull (craniotomy). Opens and retracts the brain’s membrane (dura) to access the trigeminal nerve. Moves the blood vessel and releases the trapped trigeminal nerve. Places a Teflon sponge between the nerve and the blood vessel. May also cut or destroy a part of the trigeminal neve. Closes the dura with sutures and applies a surgical glue to prevent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). May replace the bone piece using surgical glue or use a titanium plate to close the hole in the bone. Closes the incision with sutures. The patient’s vital signs are monitored in the recovery room. The patient is weaned off the anesthesia and administered painkillers.
Percutaneous trigeminal neuralgia procedures,"'Percutaneous procedures are usually performed by ''pain management'' specialists as an outpatient procedure, using local anesthesia and mild sedation or brief general anesthesia.' The patient undergoes blood tests and MRI. The doctor inserts a needle lateral to the corner of the mouth into the Gasserian ganglion, with the guidance of continuous X-ray (fluoroscopy). The doctor may perform one of the following:Pass an electric current through the needle and produce a thermal lesion with the heat, disrupting the pain signals (Percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal gangliolysis [PRTG] or radiofrequency rhizotomy).Insert a balloon and inflate it for up to 10 minutes to damage the Gasserian ganglion and block the pain signals (Percutaneous balloon decompression [PBM]).Inject glycerol to destroy the nerve’s pain fibers (Percutaneous retrogasserian glycerol rhizotomy [PRGR]). Pass an electric current through the needle and produce a thermal lesion with the heat, disrupting the pain signals (Percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal gangliolysis [PRTG] or radiofrequency rhizotomy). Insert a balloon and inflate it for up to 10 minutes to damage the Gasserian ganglion and block the pain signals (Percutaneous balloon decompression [PBM]). Inject glycerol to destroy the nerve’s pain fibers (Percutaneous retrogasserian glycerol rhizotomy [PRGR]). The doctor withdraws the needle and applies a bandage. The patient can leave for home the same day."
Gamma knife surgery for trigeminal neuralgia," Radiation therapists perform the Gamma Knife therapy as an outpatient procedure. A frame is fixed to the head with four pins to keep the head immobile.  A local anesthetic is used at the pin site. The radiologist uses stereotactic MRI for targeting the precise location of the trigeminal nerve where it connects to the brain stem. The radiologist uses the Gamma Knife device to deliver controlled beams of radiation on the point where the trigeminal nerve connects to the brain stem, to block the transmission of pain signals."
What is the recovery time for trigeminal neuralgia surgery?,'A microvascular decompression may require up to four days of hospitalization. Most people return to normal activities in about three weeks but may have to avoid strenuous activities for a while longer.''Most people can resume normal activities within two days after percutaneous procedures or a Gamma Knife surgery.' 
What are the risks and complications of trigeminal neuralgia surgery?,'Lack of relief and recurrence of neuralgia are the primary risks with all trigeminal neuralgia treatments. Other complications include:''Microvascular decompression has additional risks that include:' Abnormal facial sensation (facial dysesthesia) Facial numbness New facial pain Loss of sensation in the cornea (corneal anesthesia) Weakness in jaw muscles (masseter weakness) Anesthetic side effects such asHeadacheNauseaconfusion Headache Nausea confusion Surgical risks such asHemorrhageBlood clotsWound infectionInjury to brain stemInjury to a part of the brain (cerebellum)Cerebrospinal fluid leakagePain in an area that is completely numb to the touch (anesthesia dolorosa) Hemorrhage Blood clots Wound infection Injury to brain stem Injury to a part of the brain (cerebellum) Cerebrospinal fluid leakage Pain in an area that is completely numb to the touch (anesthesia dolorosa)
How is a partial gastrectomy performed?,"'A partial gastrectomy is usually performed with the patient under general anesthesia by a gastrointestinal surgeon. The surgery is performed in an operation theater, and may take up to five hours.''Prior to a partial gastrectomy, a patient may be required to''The patient must' Undergo urine, blood and imaging tests. Undergo corrective treatment for any existing conditions that preclude surgery. Undergo an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Avoid eating or drinking for 8 hours prior to the surgery. Check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. Inform the doctor of any allergies. Empty the bladder and bowel. The patient has an IV line attached for administration of medications and fluids. An anesthesiologist administers anesthesia and monitors the patient’s vital functions during the procedure. The patient is intubated to provide oxygen. The surgeon Inserts a nasogastric tube to decompress the stomach. Performs a gastric lavage (stomach pumping) to remove residual gastric content. Makes one or more incisions in the abdomen depending on the type of surgery. Introduces carbon dioxide into the abdomen in case of a laparoscopic surgery. Finds, excises and removes the diseased part of the stomach. May also remove other parts of the gastrointestinal tract if there is presence of cancer. May remove other organs such as spleen or pancreas, if there are visible signs of cancer. Removes adjacent lymph nodes to prevent metastasis. Connects the remaining portion of the stomach to the duodenum or jejunum, with staples or sutures. Rinses the abdominal cavity with saline (lavage). Places a surgical drain and closes the incisions with sutures. The patient is brought out of anesthesia and administered painkillers for post-surgical pain. The patient will be monitored in the recovery room for several hours until vital functions are stable. People with malignancies and comorbid conditions are likely to require continued treatment."
How long does it take to recover from a partial gastrectomy?,"'A partial gastrectomy may require hospitalization of up to 2 weeks, or less, if the procedure is laparoscopic. The patient may require feeding through a tube inserted into the small intestine and fluids through an IV line during the recovery period in the hospital.''The patient may be able to eat normally after the surgical ''wound'' heals, but may have to be on a special ''diet'' and avoid spicy, fatty or sugary foods. Without complications, full recovery can be expected in 6 weeks, during which period the patient must avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities.' "
What are the side effects of a partial gastrectomy?,'The side effects of a partial gastrectomy include' Anesthetic side effects such asHeadacheNauseaConfusion Headache Nausea Confusion Abdominal pain from the surgery Impaired digestion that may lead toGas and bloatingNausea and vomitingConstipation and/or diarrheaBile refluxDrop in sugar levelsFatigueWeight loss Gas and bloating Nausea and vomiting Constipation and/or diarrhea Bile reflux Drop in sugar levels Fatigue Weight loss Need for lifelong changes in eating habits and lifestyle Need for supplemental minerals and vitamins
What are Recreational Water Illnesses (RWIs)?,"'Recreational water illnesses (RWIs) are caused by germs spread by swallowing, breathing in mists or aerosols of, or having contact with contaminated water in swimming pools, hot tubs, water parks, water play areas, interactive fountains, lakes, rivers, or oceans. RWIs can also be caused by chemicals in the water or chemicals that evaporate from the water and cause indoor air quality problems. RWIs can be a wide variety of infections, including gastrointestinal, skin, ear, respiratory, eye, neurologic and wound infections. The most commonly reported RWI is ''diarrhea''. Diarrheal illnesses can be caused by germs such as Crypto (short for ''Cryptosporidium''), ''Giardia'', ''Shigella'', norovirus and ''E. coli'' O157:H7.' "
Where are Recreational Water Illnesses (RWIs) Found?,"'RWIs are caused by germs spread through contaminated water in swimming pools, water parks, water play areas, hot tubs, decorative water fountains, oceans, lakes, and rivers.''The most common RWI is ''diarrhea''. Swallowing water that has been contaminated with feces containing germs can cause diarrheal illness.''Swimmers share the water -- and the germs in it -- with every person who enters the pool. On average, people have about 0.14 grams of feces on their bottoms which, when rinsed off, can contaminate recreational water. In addition, when someone is ill with diarrhea, their ''stool'' can contain millions of germs. This means that just one person with diarrhea can easily contaminate the water in a large pool or water park. People may not realize that although there is no standing water in interactive fountains/water play areas, the spray water will rinse any contaminants (for example, diarrhea, vomit, and dirt) down into the water holding area and be sprayed again. In other words, the water is recycled through the system.''Swallowing even a small amount of recreational water that has been contaminated with feces containing germs can make you sick.''To ensure that most germs are killed, check chlorine or other disinfectant levels and pH regularly as part of good pool operation.''Skin infections like ""hot tub ''rash''"" are a common RWI spread through hot tubs and spas. Respiratory illnesses are also associated with the use of improperly maintained hot tubs.'""The high water temperatures in most hot tubs make it hard to maintain the disinfectant levels needed to kill germs. That's why it's important to check disinfectant levels in hot tubs even more regularly than in swimming pools.""'The germs that cause ""hot tub ''rash''"" can also be spread in pools that do not have proper disinfectant levels and in natural bodies of water such as oceans, lakes, or rivers.''Not all decorative fountains are chlorinated or filtered. Therefore, when people, especially ''diaper''-aged children, play in the water, they can contaminate the water with fecal matter. Swallowing this contaminated water can then cause diarrheal illness.'""Oceans, lakes, and rivers can be contaminated with germs from sewage spills, animal waste, water runoff following rainfall, fecal incidents, and germs rinsed off the bottoms of swimmers. It is important to avoid swallowing the water because natural recreational water is not disinfected. Avoid swimming after rainfalls or in areas identified as unsafe by health departments. Contact your state or local health department for water testing results in your area or go to EPA's beach site.""  "
How are Recreational Water Illnesses (RWIs) Spread?,"'Swallowing water that has been contaminated with feces containing germs can cause diarrheal illness.''Swimmers share the water -- and the germs in it -- with every person who enters the pool. On average, people have about 0.14 grams of feces on their bottoms which, when rinsed off, can contaminate recreational water.

This means that just one person with diarrhea can easily contaminate the water in a large pool or water park. Swallowing even a small amount of recreational water that has been contaminated with feces containing germs can make you sick. Remember, chlorine does not kill germs instantly, and some germs, such as ''Cryptosporidium'' (or ""Crypto""), are extremely chlorine tolerant.''In addition, lakes, rivers, and the ocean can be contaminated with germs from sewage spills, animal waste, and water runoff following rainfall. Some common germs can also live for long periods of time in salt water.''Many other RWIs (skin, ear, eye, respiratory, neurologic, wound, and other infections) are caused by germs that live naturally in the environment (for example, in water and soil). If disinfectant levels in pools or hot tubs are not maintained at the appropriate levels, these germs can multiply and cause illness when swimmers breathe in mists or aerosols of or have contact with the contaminated water.' "
Why Doesn't Chlorine Kill Recreational Water Illness (RWI) Germs?,"'Chlorine (in swimming pools and hot tubs) kills the germs that cause recreational water illnesses (RWIs), but the time it takes to kill each germ varies.''In pools and hot tubs with the correct pH and disinfectant levels, chlorine will kill most germs that cause RWIs in less than an hour. However, chlorine takes longer to kill some germs, such as Crypto (short for ''Cryptosporidium''). Crypto can survive for days even in a properly disinfected pool. This is why it is so important for swimmers to keep germs out of the water in the first place.''To protect yourself, your family, and other swimmers from RWIs, it is essential to learn and practice healthy swimming behaviors.'  "
Who is Most Likely to Get Ill from a Recreational Water Illness (RWI)?,"'Children, ''pregnant'' women, and people with weakened immune systems (for example, people living with ''AIDS'', individuals who have received an organ transplant, or people receiving certain types of ''chemotherapy'') can suffer from more severe illness if infected. People with weakened immune systems should be aware that recreational water might be contaminated with human or animal feces containing Crypto (short for ''Cryptosporidium''). Crypto can cause a life-threatening infection in persons with weakened immune systems.''People with a weakened immune system should consult their health care provider before participating in activities that place them at risk for illness.' "
How Can We Prevent Recreational Water Illnesses (RWIs)?,"'Here are a few easy and effective healthy swimming steps all swimmers can take each time we swim to help protect ourselves, our families, and our friends from recreational water illnesses (RWIs):'  Stay out of the water if you have diarrhea. Shower before you get in the water. Don't pee or poop in the water. Don't swallow the water. Take kids on bathroom breaks. Check diapers, and change them in a bathroom or diaper-changing area-not poolside-to keep germs away from the pool. Reapply sunscreen. Drink plenty of fluids. Pools: Proper free chlorine level (1-3 mg/L or parts per million [ppm]) and pH (7.2-7.8) maximize germ-killing power. Hot tubs/spas: Proper disinfectant level (chlorine [2-4 parts per million or ppm] or bromine [4-6 ppm] and pH [7.2-7.8]) maximize germ-killing power. Most superstores, hardware stores, and pool-supply stores sell pool test strips."
What does rectal bleeding (blood in stool) mean?,"'Rectal bleeding (known medically as ''hematochezia'') refers to the passage of red blood from the anus, often mixed with stool and/or ''blood clots'"". It is called rectal bleeding because the rectum lies immediately above the anus, but red blood in the stool may be coming from the rectum, as discussed later, but it also may be coming from other parts of the gastrointestinal tract.) The severity of rectal bleeding (i.e., the quantity of blood that is passed) varies widely. Most episodes of rectal bleeding are mild and stop on their own. Many patients report only observing a few drops of fresh blood that turns the toilet water pink or observing spots of blood on the tissue paper after they wipe. Others may report brief passage of a spoonful or two of blood. Generally, mild rectal bleeding can be evaluated and treated in the doctor's office without hospitalization or the need for urgent diagnosis and treatment.""""Bleeding also may be moderate or severe. Patients with moderate bleeding will repeatedly pass larger quantities of bright or dark red (maroon-colored) blood often mixed with stool and/or blood clots. Patients with severe bleeding may pass several bowel movements or a single bowel movement containing a large amount of blood. Moderate or severe rectal bleeding can quickly deplete a patient's body of blood, leading to symptoms of ""'weakness'', ''dizziness'', near-''fainting'' or ''fainting'', signs of ''low blood pressure'' or ''orthostatic hypotension'' (a drop in ''blood pressure'' when going from the sitting or lying position to the standing position). Rarely, the bleeding may be so severe as to cause ''shock'' from the loss of blood. Moderate or severe rectal bleeding usually is evaluated and treated in the hospital. Patients with signs and symptoms of a reduced volume of blood often require emergency hospitalization, and transfusion of blood.'  "
What are causes of blood in the stool (rectal bleeding)?,"'Blood in the stool primarily comes from the upper gastrointestinal tract (stomach and duodenum although occasionally the ''esophagus'') or the lower gastrointestinal tract (colon, rectum, and anus). Although the small intestine also may be the source of blood in the stool, compared to the upper and lower parts of the gastrointestinal tract, the small intestine is infrequently the source. Most people think of blood in the stool as meaning that the stool contains red blood, but this is not always true. As discussed previously, the bloody stool may be maroon colored or black.''The colon is the part of the gastrointestinal tract through which undigested food passes after the digestible part of the food has been digested and absorbed in the small intestine. The colon is primarily responsible for removing water from the undigested food, and storing the undigested food until it is eliminated from the body as stool. The rectum is the last 15 cm (6 inches) of the colon. The anal canal, approximately an inch in length, connects the rectum with the anus opening through which stool passes when it is eliminated from the body. Together, the colon, rectum, anal canal, and anus form a long (several ''feet'' in length), muscular tube that also is known as the ''large intestine'', large bowel, or the lower gastrointestinal tract.''The colon can be divided further into three regions; the right colon, the transverse colon, and the left colon. The right colon, also known as the ascending colon, is the part of the colon into which undigested food from the small intestine is first deposited. It is furthest from the rectum, anal canal, and anus. The transverse colon forms a ''bridge'' between the right and the left colon. The left colon is made up of the descending colon and the sigmoid colon. The sigmoid colon connects the descending colon to the rectum.''The color of blood in the stool often depends primarily on the location of the bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. Generally, the closer the bleeding site is to the anus, the brighter red the blood will be. Thus, bleeding from the anus, rectum, and the sigmoid colon tends to be bright red, whereas bleeding from the transverse colon and the right colon tends to be dark red or maroon-colored. With bleeding from the upper GI tract and depending on how long the blood remains in the stomach and small intestine, the color in the stool will change from bright red, to maroon, to black. ''Blood in the stool that is red or maroon is most commonly is referred to as rectal bleeding.''Bleeding that occurs from the stomach and duodenum frequently is black, ""tarry"" (sticky), and foul smelling.'' The black, smelly and tarry stool is called melena. ''Melena'' mostly occurs when the bleeding is in the stomach where the blood is exposed to acid or is in the small intestine for a prolonged amount of time; however, melena also may occur with bleeding from the colon if the transit of the blood through the colon is slow, and there is enough time for the intestinal bacteria to break the blood down into chemicals (hematin) that are black.''Blood from the sigmoid colon, rectum and anus usually does not stay in the colon long enough for the bacteria to turn it black. Rarely, massive bleeding from the right colon, from the small intestine, or from ulcers of the stomach or duodenum can cause rapid transit of the blood through the gastrointestinal tract and result in bright red rectal bleeding. In these situations, the blood is moving through the colon so rapidly that there is not enough time for the bacteria to turn the blood darker or black.''Another ""type"" of blood in the stool is occult blood. Occult gastrointestinal bleeding refers to a slow loss of blood into the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract that does not change the color of the stool or result in the presence of visible bright red blood. Blood in the stool is detected only by testing the stool for blood (fecal occult blood testing) in the laboratory. Occult blood in the stool has many of the same causes as rectal bleeding, and may be associated with the same symptoms as more active bleeding. For example, slow bleeding from ulcers, ''colon polyps'', or ''cancers'' can cause small amounts of blood to mix and be lost within the stool. Chronic occult bleeding often is associated with ''anemia'' due to the loss of iron along with the blood (''iron deficiency anemia'').'  "
What diseases and conditions can cause blood in the stool (rectal bleeding)?,"'Many diseases and conditions can cause rectal bleeding. Common causes include:''As discussed previously, it also is possible for ""rectal bleeding"" to be coming from the stomach and duodenum, primarily from ulcers, cancers, and angiodysplasias.'   Anal fissures Hemorrhoids Cancers and polyps of the rectum and colon Diverticulosis Abnormal blood vessels in the lining of the intestines (angiodysplasia) Ulcerative colitis Ulcerative proctitis Crohn's colitis Infectious colitis Ischemic colitis Meckel's diverticula"
Anal fissures,"'An anal fissure is a fairly common, painful condition in which the lining of the anal canal is torn. An anal fissure usually is caused by physical ''trauma'' due to ''constipation'' or a forceful bowel movement through a tight anal muscle or physical trauma also may be contributing factors. Once the skin is torn, each subsequent bowel movement can be painful, and the ''pain'' often is severe. The amount of bleeding that occurs with an anal fissure is small and usually is noticed in the toilet bowl or on the toilet paper as bright red in color. The symptoms of an anal fissure are commonly mistaken for ''hemorrhoids'', but ''hemorrhoids'' generally do not cause ''pain'' with bowel movements.'  "
Hemorrhoids,"'Hemorrhoids are masses or clumps (""cushions"") of tissue within the anal canal that contain blood vessels. Although most people think hemorrhoids are abnormal, they are present in everyone. It is only when the hemorrhoidal cushions enlarge that hemorrhoids become susceptible to trauma from passing stool and cause problems (such as bleeding or anal discomfort) and are considered abnormal or a disease. Like anal fissures, bleeding from hemorrhoids usually is mild and does not cause anemia or ''low blood pressure''. Rarely, a person may develop ''iron deficiency'' anemia as a result of repeated hemorrhoidal bleeding over several months to years, especially if the dietary intake of iron is low.'  "
Colon cancer and polyps,"'Tumors of the colon and rectum are growths (masses) arising from the wall of the large intestine. Benign tumors of the large intestine usually are called polyps because of their shape. ''Malignant'' tumors of the large intestine are cancers, and most are believed to have developed from polyps. Bleeding from colon polyps and cancers tends to be mild (the amount of blood loss is small), intermittent, and usually does not cause ''low blood pressure'' or shock.''Cancers and polyps of the colon and rectum can cause bright red rectal bleeding, maroon colored stools, and sometimes melena. The colon cancers and polyps located near the rectum and the sigmoid colon are more likely to cause mild intermittent bright red rectal bleeding, while colon cancers located in the right colon are more likely to cause occult bleeding that over time can lead to moderate or severe ''iron deficiency'' anemia.' "
Diverticulitis,"'Diverticulosis'' is a condition in which the colon contains outpouchings (little sacks). Diverticula are present in a majority of people who reach the age of 50-60 years. The cause of colonic diverticula is not entirely known, but may be contributed by years of high pressure within the colon or a weakness in the wall of the colon. Diverticula are permanent, and no ''diet'' will cause them to disappear. The only way to rid a person of diverticula is to surgically remove the part of the colon that contains the diverticula. A person with ''diverticulosis'' typically has many diverticula scattered throughout the colon, but diverticula are most common in the sigmoid and descending colon.''Most people with diverticulosis have few or no symptoms. Diverticulosis is not a problem unless a diverticulum ruptures and an infection (''abscess'') results, a condition called ''diverticulitis''. ''Diverticulitis'' causes ''abdominal pain'', ''fever'' and tenderness usually in the left lower abdomen. Rarely, bleeding can occur from a diverticulum when a blood vessel inside the diverticulum is weakened by the infection and ruptures.''Bleeding from diverticulosis (diverticular bleeding) without the presence of ''diverticulitis'' is painless. Bleeding from diverticulosis is generally more severe and brisker than bleeding from anal fissures, hemorrhoids, and colon tumors. Diverticular bleeding is the most common cause of moderate to severe rectal bleeding that requires hospitalization and blood transfusions among the elderly population in the Western world.''When bleeding occurs in a diverticulum located in the sigmoid colon, the bleeding tends to be bright red. When bleeding occurs in a diverticulum located in the right or ascending colon, the bleeding may also be bright red if the bleeding is brisk and the transit through the colon is rapid; however, the color is more likely to be dark red, maroon, or, sometimes, even black (melena).''Bleeding from diverticulosis is usually brief (it stops on its own). However, diverticular bleeding tends to recur. For example, a patient may experience several episodes of rectal bleeding from diverticula during the same hospitalization. Even after discharge from the hospital, some patients who do not have the diverticula-containing part of their colon surgically removed will experience another episode of diverticular bleeding within 4-5 years.' "
Meckel's diverticulum,"""A Meckel's diverticulum is an out-pouching (sack) that protrudes from the small intestine near the junction of the small intestine and the colon. It is present from birth and occurs in a small percentage of the population. Some Meckel's diverticula can secrete acid, like the stomach, and the acid can cause ulcerations in the inner lining of the diverticulum or the tissues of the small intestine adjacent to the diverticulum. These ulcers can bleed. Bleeding from a Meckel's diverticulum is the most common cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in children and young adults. Bleeding from a Meckel's diverticulum is painless but can be brisk and can cause bright red, dark red, or maroon stools."" "
Angiodysplasias,"""Abnormal collections of enlarged blood vessels frequently occur just under the inner lining of the colon, small intestine or stomach. These abnormal vessels are called angiodysplasias. Angiodysplasias usually can be seen easily during endoscopy as bright red, spider-like lesions just beneath the colon's lining. Although angiodysplasias may occur anywhere in the colon, they are most common in the right or ascending colon. The cause of angiodysplasias is unknown, but they occur with increasing frequency as people grow older. Bleeding from angiodysplasias is painless and can result in bright red, dark red, maroon, or ""'black stools''. Angiodysplasias also can cause occult bleeding and iron deficiency anemia.' "
Colitis and proctitis,"'Colitis means inflammation of the colon. Proctitis means inflammation of the rectum. Several different diseases can cause colitis and proctitis. These include bacterial or viral infection, ''ulcerative colitis'"" or proctitis, Crohn's colitis, ischemic colitis, and ""'radiation'' colitis or proctitis.''Ulcerative colitis'"", ulcerative proctitis, and Crohn's colitis are chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon due to overactivity of the body's immune system. These diseases can cause ""'abdominal pain'', ''diarrhea'', and ''bloody diarrhea'' (''diarrhea'' mixed with blood). Occasionally, moderate or severe rectal bleeding may occur. The bleeding originates from ulcerations in the colon.''Like ulcerative colitis and '""Crohn's colitis""', infections - bacterial and, less commonly, viral -- can inflame the colon, leading to ''abdominal pain'', diarrhea, and even bloody diarrhea. Rarely, infections may cause moderate or severe rectal bleeding. Examples of infections causing rectal bleeding include '' ''Salmonella'', '' ''Shigella'', ''Campylobacter'', '' C. difficile'', '' ''E. Coli'' O157:H7'', and ''cytomegalovirus'' (the last in individuals with ''HIV'' infection).''Ischemic colitis'' is inflammation of the colon that is caused when the supply of blood to the colon is reduced suddenly. This is most often due to a ''blood clot'' that obstructs a small artery supplying blood to a portion of the colon. The sudden reduction in the flow of blood can lead to ulceration of the colon and cause sudden onset of severe lower abdominal, cramping pain followed by rectal bleeding. The most common part of the colon affected by ischemic colitis is the splenic flexure (the part of the colon where the transverse colon joins the left colon). The amount of blood lost during an episode of ischemic colitis usually is small. Rectal bleeding and the abdominal pain of ischemic colitis usually subside on their own after several days. The colonic ulcers usually heal after a few weeks.''Radiation'' treatment for cancers of the abdomen can cause radiation colitis acutely, but permanent changes to the inner lining of the colon and the colonic blood vessels may occur, which can result in bleeding many years after treatment. A common example is radiation proctitis that results from pelvic radiation for the treatment of ''prostate cancer''. Rectal bleeding from radiation proctitis usually is mild, but occasionally can be chronic enough to cause anemia.' "
Polypectomy,"'Colon polyps found during colonoscopy usually are removed, a process called polypectomy. Bleeding can occur at the site of the polypectomy days to weeks after the polyp is removed. Such bleeding is called delayed post-polypectomy bleeding. Smaller polyps (2-3 mm in size) can be removed with biopsy forceps. The amount of blood loss from the use of a forceps usually is minute, and there will be no delayed bleeding. However, larger polyps (larger than 5-10 mm) usually are removed with an electro-surgical snare. These snares are connected to a machine that generates an electrical current. The polyp is looped within a snare, and electrical current is passed through the snare. The electrical current ''cuts'' off the polyp and cauterizes (""heat seals"") the tissue at the base of the polyps. Cauterization prevents bleeding during polypectomy; however, the site of cauterization heals with the formation of an ulcer. Rarely, these ulcers can bleed several days to up to 2-3 weeks after polypectomy. Post-polypectomy bleeding can at times be brisk and severe, and can be bright red, dark red, maroon colored, or black.' "
Rare causes of rectal bleeding,"'Rarely, rapid and severe bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract (for example, ulcers of the stomach or duodenum) can cause bright red rectal bleeding. Other rare causes include leaking of larger amounts of blood into the gastrointestinal tract when a blood vessel ruptures. This may occur when an ulcer of the gastrointestinal tract erodes into a nearby artery or when an arterial graft, for example, an aortic graft used to repair an ''aortic aneurysm'', erodes into the gastrointestinal tract. Even more rare is bleeding from a rectal ulcer, or tumors of the small intestine.' "
What kind of doctor treats rectal bleeding?,"'Rectal bleeding usually is managed by a ''gastroenterologist'', a colon and rectal surgeon, or a proctologist.' "
When should I call a doctor for blood in the stool (rectal bleeding)?,"'Any blood in the stool is not normal and should be reported to a health-care professional. However, there are certain circumstances that might be considered an emergency and medical care should be accessed immediately. These situations include:' Black, tarry stools that may be due to bleeding from the esophagus, stomach or duodenum (upper gastrointestinal [GI] tract). This is especially a potentially serious concern in patients with liver disease and/or portal hypertension who have esophageal varices. This is a potential life-threatening situation. Maroon colored stool may be caused by an upper GI bleed or a bleeding source in the small intestine. Lightheadedness, weakness, fainting (syncope), chest pain or shortness of breath may be symptoms of significant blood loss. Bleeding that is associated with fever and abdominal pain."
How is the cause of blood in the stool (rectal bleeding) diagnosed?,"'An accurate diagnosis of the location and the cause of rectal bleeding is important for proper treatment, and ''prevention'' of further bleeding. Diagnosis relies on the history and physical examination, anoscopy, flexible ''sigmoidoscopy'', colonoscopy, radionuclide scans, angiograms, and blood tests.' "
History and physical examination,"""The age of the patient may offer an important clue to the cause of rectal bleeding. For example, moderate to severe rectal bleeding in teenagers and young adults is more likely to come from a Meckel's diverticulum. Moderate or severe rectal bleeding in older individuals is more likely to be due to diverticulosis or angiodysplasias. Mild rectal bleeding in an adult with prior abdominal radiation treatment may be due to radiation proctitis.""""The presence or absence of other symptoms also may provide important clues. Bleeding from diverticulosis, angiodysplasias, and Meckel's diverticula usually is not associated with abdominal or ""'rectal pain'"". Rectal bleeding from ischemic colitis is often preceded by the sudden onset of lower abdominal, crampy pain. Fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea often occur with colitis due to infection, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's colitis. Mild bleeding accompanied with pain in the anal area during defecation (passing of stool) suggests bleeding from an anal fissure. A recent change in bowel habit such as increasing ""'constipation'' or diarrhea suggests the possibility of ''cancer of the colon''.''Inspection of the anus may disclose bleeding from a ''hemorrhoid'"" or anal fissure. Unfortunately, most hemorrhoids and fissures are not actively bleeding at the time a patient arrives at the doctor's office. Thus, even if a doctor finds a ""'hemorrhoid'' or anal fissure, he/she cannot be certain that they are the cause of the bleeding. Therefore, flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy will have to be done to exclude other potentially more serious causes of bleeding.' "
Anoscopy,"'An anoscope is a three-inch long, tapering, metal or clear ''plastic'', hollow tube approximately one inch in diameter at its wider end. The anoscope is lubricated, and the tapered end is inserted into the anus, through the anal canal, and into the rectum. As the anoscope is withdrawn, the area where internal hemorrhoids and anal fissures are found is well seen. Straining by the patient, as if they are having a bowel movement, may make hemorrhoids more prominent.''Whether or not hemorrhoids and anal fissures are found, if there has been rectal bleeding, the colon above the rectum needs to be examined to exclude other important causes of bleeding. Examination above the rectum can be accomplished by either flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, procedures that allow the doctor to examine approximately one-third or the entire colon, respectively.' "
Flexible sigmoidoscopy,"'Flexible sigmoidoscopy utilizes a flexible sigmoidoscope, a fiberoptic viewing tube with a light at its tip. It is a shorter version of a ''colonoscope'"". It is inserted through the anus and is used by the doctor to examine the rectum, sigmoid colon and part or all of the descending colon. It is useful for detecting diverticula, colon polyps, and cancers located in the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy also can be used to diagnose ulcerative colitis, ulcerative proctitis, and sometimes Crohn's colitis and ischemic colitis.""'Despite its value, flexible sigmoidoscopy cannot detect cancers, polyps, or angiodysplasias in the transverse and right colon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy also cannot diagnose colitis that is beyond the reach of the flexible sigmoidoscope. Because of these limitations, colonoscopy may be necessary. The advantage of flexible sigmoidoscopy over colonoscopy is that it can be accomplished with no preparation of the colon or after only one or two enemas.' "
Colonoscopy,"'Colonoscopy is a procedure that enables an examiner (usually a gastroenterologist) to evaluate the inside of the entire colon. This is accomplished by inserting a flexible viewing tube (the colonoscope) into the anus and then advancing it slowly under direct vision through the rectum and the entire colon. The colonoscope frequently can reach the part of the small intestine that is adjacent to the right colon.'""Colonoscopy is the most widely used procedure for evaluating rectal bleeding as well as occult bleeding. It can be used to detect polyps, cancers, diverticulosis, ulcerative colitis, ulcerative proctitis, Crohn's colitis, ischemic colitis, and angiodysplasias throughout the entire colon and rectum.""'If there is any possibility that the bleeding is coming from a location above the colon, and esophagogasatroduodenal endoscopic examination (''EGD'') also should be done to identify or exclude an upper gastrointestinal source of bleeding.' "
Video capsule and small intestine endoscopy,"""If neither an upper or lower gastrointestinal source of blood in the stool is found, the small intestine becomes suspect as the source of the bleeding. There are two ways of examining the small intestine. The first is the video capsule, a large pill containing a miniature camera, battery and transmitter that is swallowed and relays photos of the small intestine wirelessly to a recorder carried over the abdomen. The second way to examine the small intestine is with a specialized endoscope similar to the endoscopes used for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy. The advantage of these endoscopes over the video capsule is that bleeding lesions can be biopsied and treated, something that can't be done with the capsule. Unfortunately, small intestinal enteroscopy is time consuming and not generally available. Patients often must be sent to centers where small intestinal enteroscopy is available."" "
Radionuclide scans,"""There are two types of radionuclide scans that are used for determining the site of gastrointestinal bleeding; a Meckel's scan, and a tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan.""'The Meckel\'s scan is a scan for detecting a Meckel\'s diverticulum. A radioactive chemical is injected into the patient\'s vein, and a nuclear camera (like a Geiger counter) is used to scan the patient\'s abdomen. The radioactive chemical will be picked up and concentrated by the acid-secreting tissue in the Meckel\'s diverticulum and will appear as a ""hot"" area in the right lower abdomen on the scan.'""Tagged RBC scans are used to determine the location of the gastrointestinal bleeding. After drawing blood from the bleeding patient, a radioactive chemical is attached to the patient's ""'red blood cells'' and the ""tagged"" red blood cells are injected back into the patient\'s vein. If there is active gastrointestinal bleeding, the radioactive red blood cells leak into the intestine where the bleeding is occurring and will appear as a hot area with a nuclear camera. One drawback of the tagged RBC scan is that bleeding will not show as a hot area if there is no active bleeding at the time of the scan. Thus, it can fail to diagnose the site of bleeding if bleeding is intermittent and the scan is done between bleeding episodes. Another drawback of the scan is that it requires a reasonable amount of bleeding to form a hot area. Thus, it can fail to diagnose the site of the bleeding if bleeding is too slow. The tagged RBC scan is safe, and can be done quickly and without discomfort to the patient.''Unfortunately, the tagged RBC scans are not very accurate in defining the exact location of the bleeding; there is often a poor correlation between where the tagged RBC scan shows the bleeding to be and the actual site of bleeding found at the time of surgery. Therefore, tagged RBC scans cannot be relied upon to help surgeons decide what area of the gastrointestinal tract to remove in the event the bleeding is severe or persistent and requires surgery. However, if the scan shows a hot area, it usually means there is active bleeding, and the patient may be a candidate for a visceral ''angiogram'' to more accurately locate the site of bleeding.' "
Visceral angiogram,"'A visceral angiogram is an X-ray study of the blood vessels of the gastrointestinal tract. The doctor (usually a specially trained radiologist) will insert a thin, long catheter into a blood vessel in the groin and, under X-ray guidance, will advance the tip of the catheter into one of the mesenteric arteries (arteries that supply blood to the gastrointestinal tract). A radio-opaque dye is injected through the catheter and into the mesenteric artery. If there is active bleeding, the dye can be seen leaking into the gastrointestinal tract on the X-ray film. Visceral angiograms are accurate in locating rapid bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, but it is not useful if the bleeding is slow or has stopped at the time of the angiogram.''The visceral angiogram is not widely used because of its potential complications such as kidney damage from the dye, ''allergic'' reactions to the dye, and the formation of blood clots in the mesenteric arteries. It is reserved for patients who have severe and continuous bleeding and in whom colonoscopy cannot locate the site of the bleeding.' "
MRI and CT tomographic angiography,"'Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') and ''CT scan'' can both be used in a manner similar to ''X-rays'' in visceral ''angiography'', a diagnostic procedure that has been discussed previously. The use of MRI and CT angiography for diagnosis in gastrointestinal bleeding is a relatively recent development, and their value has not been clearly defined. They could be considered experimental.' "
Nasogastric tube aspiration,"'If there is concern about bleeding coming from the stomach or duodenum, nasogastric tube aspiration can be done. A thin, flexible rubber or plastic tube is passed through the nose and into the stomach. The liquid contents of the stomach then are aspirated and examined for visible blood. (The contents also can be tested for occult blood.) If the bleeding is coming from the stomach, there may be visible blood in the aspirate. There also may be visible blood if the bleeding is coming from the duodenum if some of the blood leaks retrograde back into the stomach. The main difficulty in interpreting results of aspiration is that there may be no blood if the bleeding has stopped even temporarily. Therefore, the absence of blood in the aspirate cannot completely exclude the stomach as the source of the bleeding. Only ''esophagogastroduodenoscopy'' can exclude causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.' "
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy,"'If there is major concern about bleeding coming from the esophagus, stomach or duodenum, an esophagogastricduodenoscopy (EGD) can be done using an endoscope similar to the endoscope used for colonoscopy.' "
Blood tests,"'Blood tests such as a ''complete blood count'' (''CBC'') and iron levels in the blood play no role in locating the site of gastrointestinal bleeding; however, the CBC and blood iron levels may help to determine whether bleeding is acute or chronic, since an anemia (''low red blood cell count'') associated with iron deficiency suggests chronic bleeding over many weeks or months. Colonic conditions commonly causing iron deficiency anemia include colon polyps, colon cancers, colon angiodysplasias, and chronic colitis.'""When a patient loses a large amount of blood suddenly, as with moderate or severe acute rectal bleeding, the lost blood is replaced by fluid from the body's tissues. This influx of fluid dilutes the blood and leads to anemia (a reduced concentration of red blood cells). It takes time, however, for the tissue fluid to replace the lost blood within the blood vessels. Therefore, soon after a sudden episode of major bleeding, there may be no anemia. It takes many hours and even a day or more for the anemia to develop while tissue fluid slowly dilutes the blood. For this reason, a red blood cell count early after bleeding is not reliable for estimating the severity of the bleeding."" "
What is the treatment for rectal bleeding (blood in the stool)?,"'Treatment and management of rectal bleeding include''Moderate to severe rectal bleeding can cause the loss of enough blood to result in weakness, low blood pressure, ''dizziness'', or fainting, and even shock. Patients with these symptoms usually are hospitalized. They need to be quickly treated with intravenous fluids and/or blood transfusions to replace the blood that has been lost so that diagnostic tests such as colonoscopies and angiograms can be performed safely to determine the cause and location of the bleeding.''Patients with severe iron deficiency anemia may need hospitalization for blood transfusions followed by prolonged treatment with oral ''iron supplements'' (tablets). Patients with iron deficiency anemia as a result of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss should undergo tests (such as colonoscopy) to determine the cause of the chronic blood loss.''Unless anemia is severe, patients with mild rectal bleeding from colon polyps, colon cancers, anal fissures, and hemorrhoids usually do not need hospitalization. Mild anemia can be treated with oral iron ''supplements'' while tests are performed to diagnose the cause of bleeding.''Colonoscopy is the most widely used procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of rectal bleeding. Most colonoscopies are performed after administration of oral laxatives to cleanse the bowel of stool, blood, and blood clots. However, in emergency situations such as when the bleeding is severe and continuous, a doctor may choose to perform an emergency colonoscopy without first cleansing the large bowel. In trained and experienced hands, the risk of either elective (delayed) or urgent colonoscopy is small. (Colon perforation, the most common complication, is rare). The benefits usually far outweigh the potential risks.''Colonoscopy is useful for both diagnosing the cause and determining the location of the bleeding. Locating the site of bleeding is especially important in diverticular bleeding. Even though most diverticular bleeding stops spontaneously without the need for surgery, patients with severe, recurrent, or continuous diverticular bleeding may need surgery to remove the bleeding diverticulum. Since a patient typically has numerous diverticula scattered throughout the colon, colonoscopy may be able to determine which diverticulum is bleeding prior to surgery. Without an accurate knowledge of the location of the bleeding diverticulum, the surgeon may have to perform an extensive ''colon resection'' (which is not as desirable as removing a small section of the colon) in order to make sure that the bleeding diverticulum is removed.''Nevertheless, colonoscopy has limitations. During colonoscopy doctors may not find active bleeding from a specific diverticulum. He/she may only find a colon filled with blood along with scattered diverticula. In such situations, the diagnosis of diverticular bleeding is assumed if no other cause for the bleeding such as colitis or ''colon cancer'' is found. In these situations, there is always some uncertainty about the location of the bleeding. Small, bleeding angiodysplasias also may be difficult to see and may be missed in a colon filled with blood. This is when radionuclide scans and visceral angiograms may be helpful. If the patient starts bleeding again, an urgent, tagged RBC scan followed by a visceral angiogram may demonstrate the location of the bleeding.'""Colonoscopy also cannot positively diagnose bleeding from a Meckel's diverticulum because the colonoscope usually cannot reach the part of the small intestine in which the Meckel's diverticulum is located. But colonoscopy still can be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of a bleeding Meckel's diverticulum. Thus, in a young patient with rectal bleeding, a colonoscopy showing a blood filled colon without another source of bleeding, particularly if accompanied by an abnormal Meckel's scan, makes the diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum bleeding highly likely. Surgical resection of the Meckel's diverticulum should result in permanent cure with no recurrence of bleeding.""'Colonoscopy is more than just a diagnostic tool; it can also be used to stop bleeding by removing (snaring) bleeding polyps, by cauterizing (sealing with electrical current) bleeding angiodysplasias or postpolypectomy ulcers and, occasionally, by cauterizing actively bleeding blood vessels inside diverticula. Cauterization during colonoscopy is usually accomplished by inserting a long cauterizing probe through the colonoscope. Colonoscopy with cauterization has been used to stop bleeding in many patients with bleeding from diverticula or angiodysplasias, thereby decreasing their need for blood transfusions, shortening their hospital stays, and avoiding surgery.''When colonoscopy cannot identify the site of bleeding or is unable to stop recurrent or continuous bleeding, visceral angiograms may be helpful. When a bleeding site is identified by an angiogram, medications can be infused through the angiographic catheter to constrict the bleeding blood vessel and stop the bleeding, Microscopic coils also can be infused through the catheter to plug (embolize) the bleeding blood vessel, thereby stopping the bleeding.''If colonoscopy and visceral angiogram cannot stop continuous bleeding or prevent rebleeding, then surgery becomes necessary. Ideally, the site of bleeding has been identified by colonoscopy, nuclear scans, or visceral angiogram, so that the surgeon can target the site of bleeding for exploration and excision. For example, a surgeon can usually resect a colon ''cancer'"", a bleeding polyp, or a Meckel's diverticulum with precision. Sometimes, the exact site of bleeding cannot be established, and the surgeon will have to perform an extensive colon resection under the presumption that a diverticulum or angiodysplasia is the cause of the bleeding.""'Mild rectal bleeding from anal fissures and hemorrhoids usually can be treated with local measures such as sitz baths, hemorrhoidal creams, and stool softeners. If these measures fail, several nonsurgical and surgical treatments are available.'   correcting the low blood volume and anemia; diagnosing the cause and the location of the bleeding; stopping active bleeding and preventing rebleeding; and Looking for other nonbleeding lesions that may bleed in the future."
Can rectal bleeding (blood in the stool) be prevented?,"'Most diseases that cause rectal bleeding are likely preventable, but it often is not possible.' Hemorrhoids can be avoided with proper diet and by prevention of constipation and straining to pass stool, but normal pregnancy increases the risk of hemorrhoid formation as does the acute diarrheal illness. Avoiding constipation is believed to decrease the risk of diverticulosis, outpouchings in the lining of the colon, and the risk of a diverticular bleed. Alcohol abuse increases the risk of rectal bleeding in a variety of ways, from directly irritating the lining of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, to decreasing clotting capabilities of blood."
What is the prognosis of  rectal bleeding (blood in the stool)?,"'The prognosis depends upon the underlying cause of the bleeding. Fortunately, the cause of rectal bleeding often is benign, and due to hemorrhoids or an anal fissure.''It is important to never ignore blood in the stool or rectal bleeding. It may be a clue to a serious illness and the earlier a diagnosis can be made, the better the chance for a cure.' "
What is a complete blood count (CBC) test?,"'The complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most commonly ordered blood tests. The complete blood count is the calculation of the cellular (formed elements) of blood. Special machines that analyze the different components of blood in less than a minute generally determine these calculations.''A major portion of the complete blood count is the measure of the concentration of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the blood.' "
How much does a CBC test cost?,"'The cost for a\xa0complete blood count test or CBC test varies greatly, and can run\xa0from $10.00 up to $2,700 depending on what type of insurance you have, and whether or not you have it.' "
What is the complete blood count test used for?,"'Your doctor may order this test for a variety of reasons. It may be a part of a routine check-up or screening, or as a follow-up test to monitor certain treatments.' It can also be done as a part of an evaluation based on a patient's symptoms and overall health. To diagnose a medical condition: for example, a high WBC count (leukocytosis) may signify an infection somewhere in the body or, less commonly, it may signify an underlying malignancy. A low WBC count (leukopenia) may point toward a bone marrow problem or related to some medications, such as chemotherapy. A doctor may order the test to follow the WBC count in order to monitor the response to treatment for an infection. The components in the differential of the WBC count also have specific functions and if altered, they may provide clues for particular conditions. To monitor a medical condition: a low red blood cell count or low hemoglobin may suggest anemia, which can have many causes. Possible causes of high red blood cell count or hemoglobin (erythrocytosis) may include bone marrow disease or low blood oxygen levels (hypoxia). To monitor a medical treatment: a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) may be the cause of prolonged bleeding or other medical conditions that affect the production of platelets in the bone marrow.

What causes femur fractures in adults?,"'The femur, commonly known as the thigh bone, is the largest bone located in the upper part of your leg. ''Trauma'' from a motor vehicle accident, a fall from a height or sports injuries can\xa0 ''fracture'' the thigh bone into two or more pieces.\xa0''In certain types of femur ''fractures'', the bone pieces are still in place and aligned correctly. In other types of fractures (displaced fractures), the trauma displaces the broken pieces of the femur.''Femur fractures that occur near to your knee (distal femur) are known as distal femoral fractures. Distal femoral fractures might end up damaging your knee, especially if you are an elderly person.''Certain medical conditions put you at risk of femur fracture. These include:' Brittle and porous bones (osteoporosis) during old age  Osteomyelitis (infection of the bone) Bone cancer"
What are open reduction and internal fixation of distal femoral fractures in adults?,"'Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is a commonly used surgical treatment for bone fractures, including the femur.\xa0''ORIF places the pieces of the broken femur together and allows healing of the fracture. This is done using special pieces of artificial hardware that hold the bone fragments in the correct position.' "
When is open reduction and internal fixation of femur fractures done in adults?,'You are likely to need an ORIF of femur if:' You have an open fracture (part of your femur breaks through the skin). You have a displaced fracture of the femur. Your femur has broken into more than two pieces.  You have femur fracture due to an existing bone disease like osteoarthritis.
How is open reduction and internal fixation of distal femoral fractures performed?," The surgery is done by an orthopedic surgeon — a doctor specialized in treating diseases of the muscles and bones. General anesthesia will make you sleep throughout the procedure so that you will not feel any pain.  After cleaning the affected area with an antiseptic solution, the surgeon will make anincision through the skin and muscles of your thigh until he can see the femur.  Your surgeon will align the broken pieces of your femur (open reduction). Next, your surgeon will attach the pieces of your femur with the help of screws, wires, nails, pins or metal plates (internal fixation). This holds the aligned pieces of the broken femur secure. The muscles around your thigh will be sutured closed,  followed by covering the surgical wound with a bandage."
What happens after open reduction and internal fixation of distal femoral fractures?," You will be shifted to the surgical ward and your leg will be positioned in a neutral position to avoid strain on the tendons. Generally, you can resume a normal diet right from the next day of surgery. You will be given painkillers for several days.  Your surgeon might order an X-ray of the repaired femur to confirm the success of the surgery.  Depending on the extent of your injury and your other medical conditions, you might be discharged within three to seven days. You will need to protect your wound from water by tying plastic around your leg whenever you take a shower. You will be encouraged to move around with the help of support like crutches, walker or cane. Eating a diet high in calcium and vitamin D will help in faster healing. Clean and change the dressings on your wound daily to speed its healing. Your surgeon will refer you to a physical therapist to restore your leg and knee joint mobility. The therapist will teach you the appropriate exercises to strengthen your muscles and ensure stability. Recovery from femur fractures usually takes about four to six months, and it depends upon how extensive your injury is."
What are the risks of open reduction and internal fixation of distal femoral fractures in adults?,"'All surgeries carry some risks. The risks of ORIF of femoral fractures include:''Some conditions like ''smoking'', ''diabetes'' and having weak bones put you at higher risks after the surgery. In such cases, your doctor will advise you to ''quit smoking'' tobacco for at least a few months if you can’t manage permanent cessation. They will also refer you to a diabetologist for modifying your anti-diabetic treatment or give you medications to strengthen your bones.' Surgical wound infection that spreads to the femur Bleeding from the surgical wound Damage to nerves adjacent to the femur Malunion (bone healing out of  alignment, leading to abnormal bony growth) Blood clot in the leg Blood clot in the lung Skin irritation due to the hardware Arthritis of knee"
What causes femur fractures in children?,"'The femur, commonly known as the thigh bone, is the longest and strongest bone in the ''human body''. It forms the upper part of the leg. Your child’s femur can ''fracture'' into two or more pieces after a sudden, forceful ''trauma''.''Femur ''fractures'' that occur to the part of the femur near the knee (distal femur) are known as distal femoral fractures. Because the distal femur has a growth plate, any fracture in this part of the femur may stunt its growth, shortening the affected leg.''The most common cause of distal femur fractures in infants under aged under one year is ''child abuse''. Child abuse is also a leading cause of femur fracture in children between one and four years old. In adolescents, motor vehicle accidents and falls are the major causes of femur fractures.' "
What are open reduction and internal fixation of distal femoral fractures in children?,"'Over the past couple of years, surgical treatment has been shown to reduce the hospital stays of children with femur fractures and decreased their early disability. Hence, it is increasingly preferred by doctors over the conventional methods for fixing femur fractures in children.''Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is a commonly used surgical treatment for bone fractures, including the femur.\xa0\xa0''ORIF places the pieces of the broken femur together and allows healing of the fracture. This is done using special artificial hardware to hold the bone pieces in the correct position.' "
When is open reduction and internal fixation of femur fractures done in children?,'Your child is likely to need ORIF of the femur if\xa0 they have any of the following fractures:' Displaced femur fractures (the trauma displaces the broken pieces of the femur) that have shortened more than 3 cm Open fracture (part of the femur breaks through the skin) Femur has broken into more than two pieces 
How is open reduction and internal fixation of distal femoral fractures performed?," The surgery is done by an orthopedic surgeon, a doctor specializing in treating diseases of the muscles and bones. Your child will be given general anesthesia that makes them sleep throughout the procedure.  After cleaning the affected area with an antiseptic solution, the surgeon will make a cut (incision) through the skin and muscles of the thigh until he can see the femur.  The surgeon will align the broken pieces of the femur (open reduction). Next, the surgeon will attach the pieces of the femur with the help of screws, wires, nails, pins or metal plates (internal fixation). This secures the aligned pieces of the broken femur in place. The muscles around your child’s thigh will be sutured closed and bandaged."
What happens after open reduction and internal fixation of distal femoral fractures in children?," Your child will be shifted to the surgical ward. Generally, the child can resume a normal diet right from the next day after surgery. Your child will be given painkillers for several days.  Your child’s legs will be wrapped in special support wear known as a spica cast that prevents the operated leg from moving. This is essential for the healing of femur. The spica cast typically needs to be changed every six weeks for around three to six months. This is essential for the healing of femur.  The spica cast typically needs to be changed every six weeks for around three to six months. Depending on the extent of the injury, your child might be discharged within three to seven days. Daily cleaning and changing the dressings of the wound is necessary to speed its healing. Protect your child’s wound from water by tying plastic around their leg during washing. Your surgeon may order X-rays of the operated leg at regular intervals to assess healing of the fracture.  Fractures heal more rapidly in children than that in adults. Routine activities and playing usually help children return to normal within a few weeks to months."
What are the risks of open reduction and internal fixation of distal femoral fractures in children?,"'All surgeries carry some risks. The risks of ORIF of femoral fractures in children include:''Further treatment in subsequent years can usually resolve all these problems.' Shortening of the operated leg Malunion (bone healing out of alignment, leading to abnormal bony growth) Nonunion (persisting bone fracture) Abnormal rotation of the healed femur Bending of the healed femur"
What is a posterior hip dislocation?,"'The hip is a ''ball-and-socket joint''. The socket is formed by the acetabulum, which is part of the large pelvis bone. The ball is the femoral head, which is the upper end of the femur (thigh bone).''When there is a ''hip dislocation'', the femoral head is pushed either backward out of the socket or forward.''In approximately 90% of patients with a hip dislocation, the thigh bone is pushed out of the socket in a backward direction. This is called a posterior dislocation.' "
What causes a posterior hip dislocation?,"'The adult hip joint is remarkably stable. It typically takes a major force to dislocate the hip or the presence of an underlying condition.''The most common cause of hip locations includes car collisions and falls from extreme heights that exert a tremendous forceful impact on the hip.''Following factors put you at a high risk of hip dislocation:' Elderly patients: Due to osteoporosis, a minor trauma also can dislocate the hip. Ehlers–Danlos syndrome or Down syndrome: Certain diseases that occur by birth can make you prone to get a hip dislocation even by minor trauma. Snowboarding: Extreme sports such as snowboarding can dislocate your hip. Total hip arthroplasty: Replacement of the damaged hip bone with an artificial implant (prosthesis) can lead to hip dislocation."
How is a posterior hip dislocation diagnosed?,"'A hip dislocation is very painful. Patients are unable to move the leg, and if there is nerve damage, they may not have any feeling in the foot or ankle area.''Your doctor will be able to diagnose a posterior hip dislocation by looking at your hip. A posterior dislocation will make your lower leg fixed, and your knee and foot rotated will be rotated toward the opposite limb of your body.''Your doctor will order ''X-rays'' of your hip and legs in different positions to confirm his/her diagnosis and to check if there is any associated ''fracture''.' "
What are the risks of a posterior hip dislocation?,"'When the hip dislocates, the ligaments, muscles, cartilage, and nerves holding the bones in place are often damaged. The risks of hip dislocation are as follows:' Nerve injury: Injury to the sciatic nerve, which passes through your hip, may cause weakness and pain in your lower leg. Osteonecrosis: Damage to the blood vessels around the hip may lead to the decreased blood supply to the hips and damage your hip gradually. Arthritis: Injury to the protective cartilage around the hip leads to hip arthritis."
What is the reduction of a posterior hip dislocation?,"'A hip dislocation is a serious medical emergency requiring immediate treatment—within six hours of the injury. Depending upon the injury, a hip dislocation can be fixed either by a closed reduction or open reduction.''The reduction of dislocation is a procedure to manipulate the bones back to their normal position. If this is performed externally, i.e., without opening the hip, it is known as a closed reduction. The doctor will administer an anesthetic or a sedative before performing a reduction.''If a hip dislocation is associated with deep injuries and fracture of bones, the reduction will be done in the operating room with general anesthesia, which makes you ''sleep'' throughout the procedure. This technique is called open reduction as your hip is surgically opened for the reduction.''Following reduction, the surgeon will ask for a repeat of an X-ray of your hip and possibly a computed tomography (CT) scan to make sure that the bones have been restored to their correct position.' "
How long does it take to recover from posterior hip dislocation?, It takes overall three to four months for the healing of after reduction of hip dislocation. Only then you will be able to resume all your normal activities as before. Crutches will be needed for some weeks to allow minimum pressure on your hips while walking. Physical therapy can be initiated once the pain in your hips has disappeared and when you can walk without crutches. This happens usually after four to eight weeks.
What causes posterior elbow dislocation?,"'The elbow joint is formed by two bones (the radius and ulna) of your forearm and one bone (the humerus) of your upper arm. When one or both bones of your forearm slip out of the joint, the condition is known as an ''elbow dislocation''.''An elbow dislocation is the second most common dislocation after a shoulder dislocation.''When the ulnar bone slips out to the back of your elbow, the condition is known as a posterior elbow dislocation. Nearly 90% of all elbow dislocations are posterior elbow dislocations.''The posterior elbow is dislocated when you fall on your extended arm. It is more common in adolescent athletes, particularly those who are engaged in sports such as football and wrestling.' "
How is posterior elbow dislocation diagnosed?,"'Your doctor will obtain a thorough history regarding your elbow injury and examine your elbow carefully.''In general, your doctor will recognize a posterior elbow dislocation from your complaints such as severe ''pain'' in the elbow, swelling, and inability to bend your elbow.''Some arteries and nerves run through your elbow, and they may get injured when the elbow is dislocated. Hence, your doctor will check if you have injured any of these surrounding nerves or arteries. He will ask you if you have lost sensations in your hand and check if your pulse is being felt.''Your doctor will order for a few ''X-rays'' of your elbow in different positions to confirm the diagnosis of a posterior elbow dislocation and to check if there is any associated ''fracture'' in any of the bones.' "
What is the reduction of posterior elbow dislocation?,'The reduction of posterior elbow dislocation is a procedure in which the displaced bone is aligned correctly in the joint and restored to its original position by pulling or pushing it.''Simple posterior elbow dislocations are treated with a closed reduction procedure—performed manually and externally (without opening the elbow surgically).''Complex posterior elbow dislocations (those with associated ''fractures'') require a surgery.''For reduction of a posterior elbow dislocation' You will be given sedative and pain reliever to keep you at ease through the procedure. You will be instructed to lie down facing up. Your doctor will bend your elbow and gently rotate your forearm till your palm faces up. Your doctor will then hold the upper arm down and simultaneously pull the wrist up until the joint is back in place.
What is done after the reduction of posterior elbow dislocation?,"'Your doctor will check your elbow joint for stability, and an X-ray is taken to ensure that the procedure was successful in fixing your elbow dislocation.''You will be observed for approximately two to three hours after the reduction procedure. Once the doctor confirms there is no injury to your artery, you will be sent home with the schedule of your next follow-up.''Elbow support in the form of a posterior long-arm splint, made of plaster or fiberglass, will be applied to the successfully reduced arm. This splint helps in keeping your elbow immobile and needs to stay around your elbow for approximately a week or until the ''pain'' and swelling go away.''After the splint is removed, you need to put an arm swing for approximately two to three weeks.' "
What are the risks involved in the reduction of a posterior elbow dislocation?,"'The most serious risk of joint reduction for a posterior elbow dislocation is an injury to a major artery (brachial artery) that supplies blood to your arms and hands. Your doctor will check for signs of a brachial artery injury after reduction.''If he cannot feel your pulse near your elbow, he will loosen the splint and reduce the degree of bend at your elbow. If the pulse is not restored, your doctor will immediately refer you to a surgeon to determine the need for an emergency X-ray (arteriography) of your brachial artery and subsequent surgery to repair the artery.' "
What is a radial head dislocation?,'The elbow is made up of the upper arm bone (humerus) and two bones in the forearm (radius and ulna). Some strong ligaments in the elbow hold all these bones in the elbow joint together.''A radial head dislocation is a rare condition that occurs when the top part (head) of the radius bone slips completely out of the elbow joint.''There are two joints in the elbow:''Humeroulnar joint: It is the joint between the ulna and humerus that allows the bending of the elbow.''Radiocapitellar joint: It is the joint between the radius and humerus that allows turning of the forearm with the palm up or down.''A radial head dislocation disturbs the radiocapitellar joint.' 
What causes a radial head dislocation?,"'Dislocation of the radial head can happen due to any of the following causes:''Most of the patients who have got radial head dislocations due to ''trauma'' also have associated ''fractures''. Usually, in such patients, a radial head dislocation happens due to significant trauma such as in motor vehicle accidents, pedestrian–motor vehicle accidents or falls from a significant height. Many times, this happens when the person falls on a fully extended forearm with the palms facing down.''Children with radial head dislocations may also have a slight deformity or ''fracture'' in the ulnar bone (Monteggia fracture).' Traumatic: Most patients with acute radial head dislocations in the emergency department are men who have sustained a high force injury. Congenital (present from birth): Some patients have got a radial head dislocation from their birth. Underlying disease: A radial head dislocation can occur as a complication of osteomyelitis (infection of the joint)."
What are the signs and symptoms of a radial head dislocation?, A person with a radial head dislocation typically holds his or her elbow bent at 90° and cannot turn his hand with palms facing up or down. The elbow is often swollen and tender. The forearm may appear shortened and deformed.
How does the doctor diagnose a radial head dislocation?,"'The doctor may advise for an X-ray of the affected forearm in various positions to confirm the radial head dislocation and any associated fracture.''In certain cases, computed tomography (CT) or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') may be asked for further evaluation.' "
What is the reduction of a radial head dislocation?,"'For a radial head dislocation, doctors usually advise surgery in case of adults and closed reduction in the case of children.''The reduction of dislocation is a procedure to manipulate the bones back to their normal position. If this is performed externally, that is, without opening the arm, it is known as closed reduction.''If a radial head dislocation is associated with deep injuries and fracture of bones, the reduction will be performed in the operating room with general anesthesia, which makes the patient ''sleep'' throughout the procedure. Because your arm is surgically opened for reduction, this technique is called open reduction.''The reduction of a radial head dislocation is an emergency procedure, and it generally needs to be performed within six to eight hours of injury.' "
What happens after the reduction of a radial head dislocation?," Following the reduction of a radial head dislocation, patients are generally admitted for 24 hours to observe for possible complications. The elbow is wrapped in a splint, made up of fiberglass or plaster, for one to two weeks depending upon the stability of the elbow joint. The splint helps in securing the radial head in its place after reduction. Physical therapy can be initiated once swelling and pain in the elbow disappear. The doctor will take frequent X-rays of the elbow to confirm the maintenance of the reduction of the dislocated radial head."
What is reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD)?,"'Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is a condition that features a group of typical symptoms, including ''pain'' (often ""burning"" type), tenderness, and swelling of an extremity associated with varying degrees of ''sweating'', warmth and/or coolness, flushing, discoloration, and shiny skin. RSD is also referred to as ""''complex regional pain syndrome'',"" ""the shoulder-hand syndrome,"" ""causalgia,"" and ""Sudeck\'s atrophy.""'  "
What causes reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD)?,"'The exact mechanism of how RSD develops is poorly understood. The theories include irritation and abnormal excitation of nervous tissue, leading to abnormal impulses along nerves that affect blood vessels and skin. The involuntary nervous system, peripheral nerves, and brain seem to be involved.''A variety of events can trigger the RSD, including:' injury, surgery, heart disease, degenerative arthritis of the neck, stroke or other brain diseases, nerve irritation by entrapment (such as carpal tunnel syndrome), shingles, shoulder problems, breast cancer, and drugs for tuberculosis and barbiturates."
What are the symptoms of reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD)?,"'The onset of RSD symptoms may be rapid or gradual. The condition may not display all features. It is bilateral (involving both sides of the body) in up to half of people with RSD. There are several stages of RSD with symptoms that include:'   Acute (three to six months): burning, flushing, blanching, sweating, swelling, pain, and tenderness. This stage can show early X-ray changes of patchy bone thinning. Dystrophic (three to six months): early skin changes of shiny, thickened skin and contracture with persistent pain, but diminished swelling and flushing. Atrophic (may be long-standing): loss of motion and function of the involved hand or foot with contracture (flexed scarring process), and thinning of the fatty layers under the skin. X-ray can show significant osteoporosis. "
How is reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) diagnosed?,"'RSD is diagnosed based on the clinical features described previously. Blood tests are not abnormal because of RSD, though the associated triggering events mentioned previously may lead to abnormalities in laboratory testing. Plain film X-ray testing and ''MRI'' scanning can show patchy thinning or significant ''osteoporosis''. Nuclear bone scanning can show characteristic uptake patterns.' "
What is the treatment for reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD)?,"'Response to treatment of RSD is greater in the earlier stages of the condition than in the later stages. '   Cool, moist applications to the affected areas can provide some relief of burning symptoms.  Gradual exercise can help prevent contractures.  Medications for pain and inflammation can also reduce symptoms.  For persisting symptoms, high doses of prednisone (cortisone) may be used for periods of weeks, depending on the response, and then gradually reduced.  Other medications that may be of benefit include amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep), pregabalin (Lyrica), and clonidine (Catapres, Catapres=TTS, Jenloga).  Occasionally, a nerve block with anesthetic injected into a specialized area of the involuntary nervous system (for example, a stellate ganglion blockade) can help both in treatment and in establishing the diagnosis. Sometimes a series of these blocks is tried. Other treatments include surgically interrupting the nerves (the sympathetic nerves) of the involuntary nervous system (surgical sympathectomy), implanting pumps with pain medication into the spinal canal (intrathecal drug pumps), and spinal cord stimulation devices."
Can reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) be prevented?,"'There is some evidence that early immobilization of patients with ''stroke'' or ''heart attack'' can help decrease the chances of developing RSD. Also, there have been studies demonstrating a decrease in the risk of developing RSD in patients with bony ''fractures'' using daily ''Vitamin C'' supplementation. ' "
What is the prognosis for reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD),"'The prognosis (outlook) and response to treatment in patients with RSD is unpredictable. As previously mentioned, instituting treatment early in the course of the condition leads to better outcomes.' "
What causes reflux laryngitis? Can it affect the vocal cords or cause cancer?,"'Reflux is caused by ''weakness'"" in the muscle at the junction of the esophagus with the stomach. Normally, this muscular valve, or sphincter, functions to keep food and stomach acid from moving upward from the stomach to the esophagus and larynx. This valve opens to allow food into the stomach and closes to keep the stomach's contents from coming back up. The backward movement of stomach contents (gastric contents) up into the esophagus is called gastroesophageal reflux. Moreover, any increase in abdominal pressure (such as obesity or tight clothing, which can push acid back from the stomach up the esophagus) or a person with a hiatal ""'hernia'' will have an increased risk for reflux. When it causes symptoms or esophageal inflammation it is referred to as ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (or ''GERD''). When the acid backs up into the voice box (larynx), the condition is referred to as reflux laryngitis.''Stomach acid can cause irritation of the lining of the esophagus, larynx, and throat. This can lead to''Rarely, reflux can lead to cancers of the esophagus or larynx.'   erosion of the lining of the esophagus (erosive esophagitis), narrowing of the esophagus (stricture), chronic hoarseness, chronic throat clearing, discomfort swallowing food, foreign body sensation in the throat, asthma or cough, spasms of the vocal cords, sinusitis, and growths on the vocal cords (granulomas)."
What are the symptoms and signs of reflux laryngitis?,"'Heartburn is the most common symptom associated with reflux. The American College of Gastroenterology estimates that more than 60 million Americans experience heartburn at least once a month and some studies suggest that more than 15 million people experience heartburn symptoms each day. The incidence of GERD is on the rise, and the rise in obesity is believed to be a contributing factor. In addition to heartburn, reflux severe enough to cause laryngitis can cause chronic hoarseness, ''asthma'', or a foreign body sensation in the throat (globus phenomenon). Considering the high prevalence of GERD, reflux laryngitis and its symptoms are uncommon.'  "
How is reflux laryngitis diagnosed?,"'In most patients, the presumptive diagnosis of reflux laryngitis is based on the typical history of heartburn and hoarseness. Testing usually is reserved for those patients who do not respond to conservative therapy (as explained below) or drug therapy. Diagnostic tests includes an:' esophagram (and X-ray of the esophagus) endoscopy, laryngoscopy, esophageal pH acid monitoring, and esophageal motility studies."
8 Reflux laryngitis diet tips and home remedies,"'Diet'', home remedies, medications, and lifestyle changes to treat acid reflux, heartburn, and reflux laryngitis.'   Avoid large meals at dinner. Avoid eating before bedtime, and allow several hours after eating before lying down to allow the stomach to empty. Avoid spicy or fried foods, peppermint, citrus, tomatoes, onions, and chocolate, especially if these foods increase symptoms. Diet should be high-protein, high-carbohydrate, and low fat Avoid alcohol, caffeinated beverages, and tobacco. Elevate the head of the bed with wooden blocks under the bedposts to allow gravity to keep the acid in the stomach. Pillows under the head are not helpful, however, wedges that elevate the head and upper chest are effective. Lose weight to reduce reflux. If you smoke, stop."
"What OTC, prescription medications, and surgery to treat acid reflux?","'There are several different types of medications available over the counter (OTC) or by prescription.''Antacids neutralize stomach acid and give immediate relief. Popular choices include ''sodium bicarbonate'' (Alka Seltzer), ''calcium carbonate'' (''Tums'', Rolaids, Alka-Mints), and aluminum and magnesium antacids (''Maalox'', ''Mylanta'', ''Riopan'', Gaviscon). Use antacids 30 to 60 minutes after each meal and at bedtime because they are more effective at these times.''People on a low sodium diet should avoid sodium bicarbonate. Calcium and aluminum can cause ''constipation'', while magnesium antacids can cause ''diarrhea''. Patents with ''kidney disease'' should avoid magnesium and aluminum antacids. Check with your pharmacist or doctor for any interactions with other medications you are taking.''Drugs'' such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDS''), ''theophylline'' (''Theo-Dur'', ''Respbid'', ''Slo-Bid'', ''Theo-24'', ''Theolair'', ''Uniphyl'', Slo-Phyllin), anticholinergics, and ''calcium channel blockers'' should be avoided if feasible, but discuss discontinuing any medication with a doctor first.''The acid-blocking drugs (''famotidine'' [''Pepcid''], ''cimetidine'' [''Tagamet''], ''nizatidine'' [''Axid''], ''ranitidine'' [''Zantac'']) are known as H2-blockers. These are available without a prescription. However, their strength may be inadequate.''Other valuable medications include ''metoclopramide'' (''Reglan''), which helps to empty the stomach more rapidly; or proton pump inhibitors, such as ''omeprazole'' (''Prilosec'') and ''lansoprazole'' (''Prevacid'').''If conservative therapy and medical therapy fail, surgery may be necessary. Traditionally, ''fundoplication'', a procedure that serves to strengthen or recreate the muscular valve (lower esophageal sphincter), requires significant surgical work and hospital stay. Surgery or fundoplication also has been able to be done with an endoscope, which shortens the hospital stay and recovery.' "
What are the difficulties in diagnosing reflux laryngitis?,"'In some patients'' it appears clear that the laryngeal symptoms - hoarseness, cough, ''sore throat'' - are due to reflux, for example, in patients with marked heartburn and regurgitation of acid.''In most patients'' with laryngeal symptoms - those with milder heartburn and no regurgitation who comprise the majority of patients in whom reflux laryngitis is considered - it is not as clear. Examination of the larynx may reveal redness and swelling, but many diseases of the larynx as well as reflux can cause these signs.''There are difficulties with using symptoms to diagnose reflux. For example, cough may occur when there is reflux into the esophagus. Refluxed liquid does not need to reach the larynx.''Finally, it is unclear whether refluxed liquid from the stomach that is not acid can cause reflux laryngitis, and there is no way of testing whether or not non-acid liquid is reaching the larynx. Many physicians use a trial of potent acid-suppression with ''PPIs'' to try to prove that acid reflux is the cause of the laryngeal symptoms. The problem with a trial of PPIs is that some symptoms such as cough and throat clearing can be caused by habit, and the PPIs may have a placebo effect. Thus, a response to PPIs may not be proof that reflux is the cause of symptoms.' "
Facts you should know about relapsing polychondritis," Relapsing polychondritis is an uncommon, chronic disorder of the cartilage. Relapsing polychondritis is characterized by recurrent episodes of painful inflammation. Relapsing polychondritis can involve all types of cartilage. Typical cartilage tissues affected include the ears, nose, and joints. There is no one specific test for diagnosing relapsing polychondritis. Treatment often involves cortisone-related medications. The course of symptoms for patients is often unpredictable."
What is relapsing polychondritis?,"'Relapsing polychondritis is an uncommon, chronic disorder of the cartilage that is characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation of the cartilage of various tissues of the body. Chondritis means inflammation of cartilage. Tissues containing cartilage that can become inflamed include the ears, nose, joints, spine, and windpipe (trachea). The eyes, ''heart'', and blood vessels, which have a biochemical ''makeup'' similar to that of cartilage, can also be affected. Relapsing polychondritis is sometimes called the red ear syndrome.' "
What causes relapsing polychondritis?,"'The cause of relapsing polychondritis is unknown. It is suspected that this condition is caused by ""autoimmunity."" Autoimmunity is characterized by a misdirected immune system. This results in inflammation in various tissues of the body.' "
What are signs and symptoms of relapsing polychondritis?,"'Typically, relapsing polychondritis causes sudden ''pain'' in the inflamed tissue at the onset of the disease. Common symptoms are ''pain'', redness, swelling, and tenderness in one or both ears, the nose, throat, joints, and/or eyes. The lobe of the ear is not involved. ''Fever'', ''fatigue'', and ''weight loss'' often develop.''Inflammation of the ears and nose can cause deformity (saddle nose deformity and floppy ears) from weakened cartilage. Impaired ''hearing'', balance, and ''nausea'' can be caused by ''inner ear inflammation''.''Inflammation of the windpipe or trachea can lead to throat pain, ''hoarseness'', and ''breathing'' difficulty. This is a potentially dangerous area of inflammation in patients with relapsing polychondritis and can require assisted breathing methods when severe.''Joint inflammation'' (''arthritis'') can cause pain, swelling, and ''stiffness'' of the joints, including of the hands, knees, ankles, wrists, and ''feet''.''Eye inflammation can be mild or severe and can damage vision. ''Cataracts'' can be caused by the inflammation or from the cortisone used to treat relapsing polychondritis (see below).''Other tissues that can develop inflammation include the ''aorta'' (which can lead to ''aneurysm'' or ''aortic valve'' ''weakness''), tissues in or around the heart (''myocarditis'' and ''pericarditis''), the skin (''vasculitis''), and the nerves from the brain (cranial nerve palsies).'  "
How do doctors diagnose relapsing polychondritis?,"'Relapsing polychondritis is diagnosed when the doctor recognizes the classic pattern of cartilage involvement during the history and physical examination. The symptoms described above can suggest the disease.''There is no one specific test for diagnosing relapsing polychondritis. Blood tests that indicate inflammation, such as an elevated erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' (ESR), ''C-reactive protein'', and others, are often abnormal when the disease is active.''If tissue cartilage is biopsied, the involved cartilage will demonstrate nonspecific signs of inflammation.' "
Can relapsing polychondritis be associated with other diseases?,"'Yes. The doctor will be interested in determining whether or not signs of the following diseases are present along with relapsing polychondritis: ''vasculitis'', ''granulomatosis with polyangiitis'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''ankylosing spondylitis'"", Reiter's disease, ""'psoriatic arthritis'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', '""Behcet's disease""', ''Churg-Strauss syndrome'', ''polyarteritis nodosa'', myelodysplasia, and others.' "
What medications are used to treat relapsing polychondritis?,"'For patients with more mild disease, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''), including ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin''), ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn''), and others, can be helpful to control the inflammation. Usually, however, cortisone-related medications (steroids such as ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone'') are required. High-dose steroids are frequently necessary initially, especially when the eyes or breathing airways are involved. Moreover, most patients require steroids for long-term use.''Methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall'') has shown promise as a treatment for relapsing polychondritis in combination with steroids as well as a maintenance treatment. Studies have demonstrated that methotrexate can help reduce the steroid requirements.''Other medications that have been tried in small numbers of patients with some reports of success include ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), ''dapsone'', ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''penicillamine'' (''Depen'', ''Cuprimine''), ''cyclosporine'', anti-''tumor'' necrosis factor (TNF) biologic medications (''adalimumab'' [''Humira''], ''infliximab'' [''Remicade'']), and combinations of these drugs with steroids.'  "
What is the long-term prognosis for patients with relapsing polychondritis?,"'The course of symptoms for patients with relapsing polychondritis is often unpredictable.''Repeated bouts of inflammation of cartilage from relapsing polychondritis frequently leads to permanent destruction of the involved tissues and results in disability. Destruction of nose and ear cartilage results in deformity and can impair breathing when the trachea is affected.''Relapsing polychondritis is potentially dangerous and even life threatening, depending on the tissues involved. Inflammation of the cartilage of the windpipe (trachea), heart, aorta, and other blood vessels can be fatal. For some patients, however, the disease is much more limited and mild. Close monitoring of symptoms with a qualified doctor is recommended for optimal results.' "
Facts you should know about renal artery stenosis," Elevated blood pressure (hypertension) is common and is generally simply treated with medications. Likewise, various other methods are used to treat the large majority of patients with kidney failure. There is a small subgroup of patients with high blood pressure and/or renal failure caused by renal artery stenosis. Some of these patients may respond favorably to dilating the narrowed artery, using the technique of angioplasty. The patients that can benefit from angioplasty have a severe stenosis (75% or greater narrowing) of the renal artery and do not have a very high renal vascular resistance."
What are the renal arteries?,"'Renal refers to anything related to the kidneys. Renal arteries carry blood from the ''heart'' to the kidneys. They branch directly from the ''aorta'' (the main artery coming off the heart) on either side and extend to each kidney. These arteries take a very large volume of blood to the kidneys to be filtered.''The heart pumps out approximately 5 liters of blood per minute, and about 1-1.5 liters (25%) of the total volume of blood pumped by the heart passes through the kidneys every minute.' "
What is renal artery stenosis?,"'Renal artery stenosis (narrowing) is a decrease in the diameter of the renal arteries. The resulting restriction of blood flow to the kidneys may lead to impaired kidney function (renal failure) and ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''), referred to as renovascular ''hypertension'', or RVHT (""reno"" for kidney and ""vascular"" for blood vessel).''Renovascular hypertension is as likely to occur with bilateral stenosis (when arteries to both kidneys are narrowed) as with unilateral stenosis (when the artery to one kidney is narrowed). The decreased blood flow to the kidneys impairs renal function. Renal artery stenosis may cause renal failure in some patients. There is no predictable relationship between renal failure and renal artery stenosis. Some patients have very severe bilateral stenosis and normal renal function. Most cases of renal failure are related to ''diabetes'', hypertension, glomerular sclerosis, ''contrast nephropathy'', drug toxicity and other causes.' "
What are the causes of renal artery stenosis?,"'The majority of renal artery stenosis is caused by ''atherosclerosis'' (hardening and narrowing of blood vessel wall from the inside) similar to the process that occurs in blood vessels in the heart and other parts of the body.''Risk factors for atherosclerosis include:''Less common causes of renal artery stenosis are rare conditions such as\xa0fibromuscular dysplasia of the vessels (narrowing of the vessel due to internal thickening of the blood vessel wall), arteritis (inflammation of the blood vessel), or dissection (tearing and division of the blood vessel wall).'   high cholesterol levels high blood pressure age cigarette smoking diabetes"
How common is renal artery stenosis?,"'Narrowing of the kidney arteries is more common in individuals 50 years of age and older. It is estimated that some degree of narrowing (greater than 50%) is found in about 18% of adults between 65-75 years of age and 42% of those older than 75 years of age. This may be due to the fact that atherosclerosis is more common in this age group. ''In younger patients, the narrowing of the renal artery usually is due to the thickening of the artery (fibromuscular dysplasia) and it is more common in women than men.''It is estimated that renal artery stenosis accounts for approximately 1% of mild to moderate cases of ''high blood pressure''. It may be responsible for more than 10% of cases of severely elevated or difficult to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).' "
What are the symptoms of renal artery stenosis?,"'In general, renal artery stenosis is not associated with any obvious or specific symptoms. Suspicious signs for renal artery stenosis include:''Typically, unilateral (one-sided) renal artery stenosis may be related to high blood pressure whereas bilateral (two-sided) renal artery stenosis is more often related to diminished kidney function.' high blood pressure that responds poorly to treatment; severe high blood pressure that develops prior to age 30 or greater than age 50; an incidental finding (discovered through routine tests or tests performed for another condition) of one small kidney compared to a normal sized one on the other side."
What problems does renal artery stenosis cause?,"'When the circulating blood volume becomes depleted as a result of, for example, ''dehydration'' or bleeding, the blood flow to the kidneys is likewise reduced. The normal physiologic reaction to a decrease in blood flow to the kidneys is a complex hormonal response by the kidneys, called the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. ''This hormonal system is activated as a defense against ''low blood pressure'' and low circulating blood volume. The kidney senses a possible decrease in the circulating blood when blood flow through these vessels is reduced. As a result, there are increased blood levels of the hormone angiotensin 2, which causes narrowing of the small blood vessels in the kidneys. ''This, together with increased blood aldosterone levels (another hormone), promotes salt retention by the kidneys, and works to maintain blood pressure and restore blood volume. Accordingly, this hormonal system is protective in response to reduced circulation of blood to the kidneys that is caused either by volume depletion, as described, or by reduced blood pressure. ''This otherwise normal hormonal response can become abnormal (pathologic) when the decreased blood flow to the kidneys results from a narrowing of diseased renal arteries. In this situation, the kidneys receive less blood flow, which then signals a sense of depletion of the circulating blood volume, despite the fact that the blood volume is actually normal. So, the diminished renal blood flow, by stimulating the production of angiotensin 2 and aldosterone, can lead to an abnormal increase of blood pressure (renovascular hypertension).' "
Who should be screened for renal artery stenosis?,"'A search for renal artery stenosis may be undertaken in patients with progressive ''kidney failure'' of unknown cause, or in individuals with difficult to treat high blood pressure (hypertension that does not respond well to medications). The diagnosis of renal artery stenosis may be considered when any or all of the following are present: ' High blood pressure that is difficult to control with the usual medications.  An abdominal bruit (a rubbing sound heard with a stethoscope placed on the abdomen suggesting a narrowed vessel) along with high blood pressure. Moderately to severely elevated blood pressure, with an onset before age 30 or after age 50.  Moderately to severely elevated blood pressure in a person with known atherosclerosis elsewhere in the body (history of heart attack or stroke). Easily controlled high blood pressure that becomes difficult to control. Worsening of kidney function after initiation of certain blood pressure medications [angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE Inhibitor), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)]."
How is renal artery stenosis diagnosed?,'Several tests exist to detect any evidence of renal artery stenosis. They can be divided into imaging tests and functional tests. The imaging tests provide a picture of the blood vessel and its anatomy and reveal the degree of narrowing. The functional tests provide information about whether the narrowing is significant enough to cause the high blood pressure or kidney dysfunction. Each of these tests has advantages and shortcomings.'  
What are the common imaging tests to evaluate renal artery stenosis?,"'An ''angiogram'' of the renal arteries is the best test available to detect the degree of narrowing. However, ''angiography'' is not the primary test and is performed only for those patients who have evidence of stenosis on less invasive testing, such as ''ultrasound'', CT Angio, or MR Angio. Angiography is a preliminary portion of a procedure, which will generally culminate in angioplasty and possibly stenting to treat a stenosis identified on less invasive testing.''The angiogram of the renal arteries is similar to an angiogram of the heart and involves insertion of a catheter through the groin into the main artery (the aorta), that is advanced to the level of the renal arteries. These tests are most commonly performed through the groin, but arteries in other parts of the body, such as the arms, can be used equally well. A dye is injected, and x-ray images are taken to see the caliber of the blood vessel and extent of the narrowing. ''An angiogram is considered an invasive test (insertion of the catheter inside the body) and therefore is not widely used because of the risk of complications. This test also may not determine if narrowing is truly significant to cause the problem or not, and so it may be necessary to combine this with a functional test. Generally, a narrowing of greater than 75% by angiogram is considered significant enough to cause high blood pressure or kidney dysfunction. An additional advantage of an angiogram is that if a treatable narrowing is seen, it may be fixed at the same time via angioplasty or by placing a ''stent'' (described in more detail below).''Other less invasive imaging tests are available to detect renal artery stenosis, but they are not generally as accurate as the angiogram and could potentially miss some cases of correctable disease. The most commonly used additional imaging tests are:''Magnetic resonance angiography'' (MRA) is similar to a ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''). Contrast dye is injected into the blood via a vein in the arm, and pictures of the specific area of the body (in this case the renal arteries) are taken and analyzed. The accuracy (specificity and sensitivity) of this test is reasonable. This test cannot be done in patients with metal implants, pacemakers, or ''claustrophobia'' (''fear of closed spaces''). It may be used in people with mild to moderate, but not severe, kidney problems. ''Computed tomographic angiography'' is similar to a computed tomography (''CT scan'') and has reasonable accuracy. This is also done by injecting a contrast dye into the blood and taking pictures of the renal arteries. This is not recommended in people with moderate to severe kidney problems as it may make the problem worse.''Doppler ultrasound'' is the least invasive imaging test for renal artery stenosis. It is performed similarly to a regular ultrasound by placing a probe on the abdomen to visualize the flow across the renal arteries and also to measure any narrowing. Its accuracy is similar to the other tests above, but its advantage is that it can measure the size of the narrowing as well as the flow across it. The disadvantage of this test is that it is time-consuming and may take up to a couple of hours to complete. It is also very operator-dependent, meaning that the accuracy of the result is dependent upon the expertise and experience of the ultrasound technician.' Magnetic resonance angiography Computed tomographic angiography Duplex Doppler ultrasonography"
What functional tests are used for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis?,"'The main functional tests for renal artery stenosis include the plasma renin activity test and ''captopril'' renogram. These tests have been largely replaced by the imaging tests described above because they are less accurate, but they may be still performed to help establish the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis.''The plasma renin activity measures the activity of the hormone renin (described above). Activity of renin is generally higher in the kidney with renal artery stenosis compared to the other kidney. This response may be exaggerated by administration of captopril (''Capoten''), an ACE inhibitor medication used to treat high blood pressure. ''The renogram measures the activity of the kidneys after injection of a radioactive material that is taken up by the kidney. By administering captopril prior to the test, the activity may become more enhanced on the normal kidney compared to the one with renal artery stenosis. This may indicate a significant renal artery narrowing on the side with less activity.' "
What are medical treatments for renal artery stenosis?,"'In bilateral (both-sided) and unilateral (one-sided) renal artery stenosis associated with high blood pressure, controlling the blood pressure with usual blood pressure medications is the first and the safest treatment. ''ACE inhibitors'' or ARB medications with or without a diuretic (water pill) may be tried first. This approach may lead in some patients to worsening of their kidney function. Therefore, kidney function needs to be followed closely and if worsening of kidney function is evident, these medications may need to be stopped.''It is worth noting that if renal artery stenosis is found incidentally when performing a test for another disease and there is no evidence of kidney dysfunction or high blood pressure, then no treatment may be necessary. Sometimes even significant stenosis may not be associated with high blood pressure or kidney dysfunction. In these situations, periodic monitoring of blood pressure and kidney function may be advised.' "
What surgical procedures are available for renal artery stenosis?,"'If the results of any of these screening tests suggest an abnormality of the renal artery, an x-ray angiography is then performed. A 75% or greater narrowing of the renal artery seen on the angiogram has been termed treatable renal artery stenosis. ''Treatable means that the stenosis of the artery is severe (75% or greater narrowing), the artery needs to be widened (dilated), and it has a good chance of responding favorably to the dilatation. Usually right at the time of the angiography, an angioplasty is done. In this procedure a tiny balloon is inflated in the interior space in the artery (the lumen) to dilate the narrowed artery. Additionally, as part of the angioplasty procedure, a stent (tubular device to prevent recurrence of the narrowing) may be placed in the artery.''In rare cases, vascular surgery (on the blood vessels) may be done for renal artery stenosis. In these situations, typically another vascular surgery near the renal arteries, for example the aorta, is the main procedure. If renal artery stenosis is also present, then a bypass renal artery surgery may be done at the same time.''These invasive procedures are typically reserved for cases that do not respond to medical treatment and where it has been determined that the stenosis is causing or contributing to the uncontrolled high blood pressure. These invasive procedures may only be done if it is thought that the kidney dysfunction or elevated blood pressure can be effectively treated with the procedures.' "
Which patients can benefit from surgical procedures for renal artery stenosis?,"'In patients with renal failure due to bilateral renal artery stenosis (narrowing on both kidneys), angioplasty procedures for both renal arteries may improve or stabilize kidney function. Similarly, in hypertensive patients with unilateral (one-sided) renal artery stenosis, angioplasty procedures of the involved renal artery may cure or improve the high blood pressure. Patients with milder degrees of stenosis (less than a 75% reduction in the width of the renal artery lumen) usually do not benefit from angioplasty. These patients need to be followed by sequential imaging procedures to detect further narrowing (progression) to the point of treatable stenosis. At that point, angioplasty procedures can be done with the hope of a favorable response.''Some studies have suggested that patients with a very high degree of renal vascular resistance (which reflects permanent damage to the kidneys), even with a 75% or more stenosis of the renal artery, often have a poor response to the angioplasty procedures. (The tension of the blood vessels to the kidney, called renal vascular resistance, is measured by Doppler ultrasonography. A so-called resistive index over 0.8 is considered very high). In these patients, angioplasty is usually not done and the high blood pressure or renal failure is managed only by the customary therapeutic measures for these problems as described previously.'  "
What is renal osteodystrophy?,"'The medical term ""renal"" describes things related to the kidneys. Renal osteodystrophy is a bone disease that occurs when your kidneys fail to maintain the proper levels of calcium and phosphorus in your blood. It\'s a common problem in people with kidney disease and affects most dialysis patients. ''Renal osteodystrophy is most serious in children because their bones are still growing. The condition slows bone growth and causes deformities. One such deformity occurs when the legs bend inward toward each other or outward away from each other; this deformity is referred to as ""renal ''rickets''."" Another important consequence is short stature. Symptoms can be seen in growing children with ''renal disease'' even before they start dialysis.''The bone changes from renal osteodystrophy can begin many years before symptoms appear in adults with kidney disease. For this reason, it\'s called the ""silent crippler."" The symptoms of renal osteodystrophy aren\'t usually seen in adults until they have been on dialysis for several years. Older patients and women who have gone through ''menopause'"" are at greater risk for this disease because they're already vulnerable to ""'osteoporosis'', another bone disease, even without kidney disease. If left untreated, the bones gradually become thin and weak, and a person with renal osteodystrophy may begin to feel bone and joint ''pain'"". There's also an increased risk of bone fractures."" "
Hormones and Minerals,"'In healthy adults, bone tissue is continually being remodeled and rebuilt. The kidneys play an important role in maintaining healthy bone mass and structure because one of their jobs is to balance calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood.'""Calcium is a mineral that builds and strengthens bones. It's found in many foods, particularly milk and other dairy products. If calcium levels in the blood become too low, four small glands in the neck called the parathyroid glands release a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH). This hormone draws calcium from the bones to raise blood calcium levels. Too much PTH in the blood will remove too much calcium from the bones; over time, the constant removal of calcium weakens the bones. ""'Phosphorus, which is found in most foods, also helps regulate calcium levels in the bones. Healthy kidneys remove excess phosphorus from the blood. When the kidneys stop working normally, phosphorus levels in the blood can become too high, leading to lower levels of calcium in the blood and resulting in the loss of calcium from the bones.''Healthy kidneys produce calcitriol, a form of ''vitamin D'', to help the body absorb dietary calcium into the blood and the bones. If calcitriol levels drop too low, PTH levels increase, and calcium is removed from the bones. Calcitriol and PTH work together to keep calcium balance normal and bones healthy. In a patient with ''kidney failure'"", the kidneys stop making calcitriol. The body then can't absorb calcium from food and starts removing it from the bones."" "
How is renal osteodystrophy diagnosed?,"'To diagnose renal osteodystrophy, your doctor may take a sample of your blood to measure levels of calcium, phosphorus, PTH, and calcitriol. The doctor may perform a bone biopsy to see how dense your bones are. A bone biopsy is done under local anesthesia and involves removing a small sample of bone from the hip and analyzing it under a microscope. Determining the cause of renal osteodystrophy helps the doctor decide on a course of treatment.' "
How is osteodystrophy treated?,"'Controlling PTH levels prevents calcium from being withdrawn from the bones. Usually, overactive parathyroid glands are controllable with a change in ''diet'"", dialysis treatment, or medication. The drug cinacalcet hydrochloride (Sensipar), approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2004, lowers PTH levels by imitating calcium. If PTH levels can't be controlled, the parathyroid glands may need to be removed surgically.""""If your kidneys aren't making adequate amounts of calcitriol, you can take synthetic calcitriol as a pill or in an injectable form. Your doctor may prescribe a calcium supplement in addition to calcitriol.""""Renal osteodystrophy can also be treated with changes in diet. Reducing dietary intake of phosphorus is one of the most important steps in preventing bone disease. Almost all foods contain phosphorus, but it's especially high in milk, cheese, dried beans, peas, nuts, and peanut butter. Limit ""'drinks'' such as cocoa, dark sodas, and beer. Often, medications such as ''calcium carbonate'' (''Tums''), ''calcium acetate'' (''PhosLo''), sevelamer hydrochloride (''Renagel''), or lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol) are prescribed with meals and snacks to bind phosphorus in the bowel. These decrease the absorption of phosphorus into the blood. Be sure your phosphate binder is aluminum-free because aluminum can be toxic and cause ''anemia''. A renal dietitian can help develop a dietary plan to control phosphorus levels in the blood.''Exercise'"" has been found to increase bone strength in some patients. It's important, however, to consult a doctor or health care professional before beginning any exercise program.""""A good treatment program, including proper attention to dialysis, diet, and medications, can improve your body's ability to repair bones damaged by renal osteodystrophy.""

What are the kidneys?,'Your kidneys are a pair of organs in your abdomen. Each kidney is about the size of a fist.''Your kidneys are part of the urinary tract. They make urine by removing wastes and extra water from your blood.''Urine collects in a hollow space (renal pelvis) in the middle of each kidney. Urine passes from your renal pelvis into your bladder through a long tube called a ureter. Urine leaves your bladder through a shorter tube (the urethra).''Your kidneys also make substances to help control ''blood pressure'' and to make ''red blood cells''.''Attached to the top of each kidney is an adrenal gland. A layer of fatty tissue and an outer layer of fibrous tissue surround the kidney and adrenal gland.' 
What is cancer?,"'Cancer begins in cells, the building blocks that make up tissues. Tissues make up the kidneys and the other organs of the body.''Normal cells grow and divide to form new cells as the body needs them. When normal cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.'""Sometimes, this process goes wrong. New cells form when the body doesn't need them, and old or damaged cells don't die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor.""'Tumors in the kidney can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). Benign tumors are not as harmful as malignant tumors:''Kidney cancer cells can spread by breaking away from the kidney tumor. They can travel through lymph vessels to nearby ''lymph nodes''. They can also spread through blood vessels to the ''lungs'', bones, or ''liver''. After spreading, kidney cancer cells may attach to other tissues and grow to form new tumors that may damage those tissues.' Benign tumors (such as cysts):are usually not a threat to lifecan be treated or removed and usually don't grow backdon't invade the tissues around themdon't spread to other parts of the body are usually not a threat to life can be treated or removed and usually don't grow back don't invade the tissues around them don't spread to other parts of the body Malignant growths:may be a threat to lifeusually can be removed but can grow backcan invade and damage nearby tissues and organscan spread to other parts of the body may be a threat to life usually can be removed but can grow back can invade and damage nearby tissues and organs can spread to other parts of the body"
What are kidney cancer causes and risk factors?,"""When you get a diagnosis of kidney cancer, it's natural to wonder what may have caused the disease. Doctors usually can't explain why one person gets kidney cancer and another doesn't.""'However, we do know that people with certain risk factors may be more likely than others to develop kidney cancer. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of getting a disease.''Studies have found the following risk factors for kidney cancer:'""Many people who get kidney cancer have none of these risk factors, and many people who have known risk factors don't develop the disease."" Smoking: Smoking tobacco is an important risk factor for kidney cancer. People who smoke have a higher risk than nonsmokers. The risk is higher for those who smoke more cigarettes or for a long time. Obesity: Being obese increases the risk of kidney cancer. High blood pressure: Having high blood pressure may increase the risk of kidney cancer. Family history of kidney cancer: People with a family member who had kidney cancer have a slightly increased risk of the disease. Also, certain conditions that run in families can increase the risk of kidney cancer.Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome: VHL is a rare disease that runs in some families. It's caused by changes in the VHL gene. People with a changed VHL gene have an increased risk of kidney cancer. They may also have cysts or tumors in the eyes, brain, or other parts of the body. Family members of those with VHL can have a test to check for a changed VHL gene. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome: VHL is a rare disease that runs in some families.

How is kidney cancer diagnosed?,"""If you have symptoms that suggest kidney cancer, your doctor will try to find out what's causing the problems.""'You may have a physical exam. Also, you may have one or more of the following tests:'   Urine tests: The lab checks your urine for blood and other signs of disease. Blood tests: The lab checks your blood for several substances, such as creatinine. A high level of creatinine may mean the kidneys aren't doing their job. Ultrasound: An ultrasound device uses sound waves that can't be heard by humans. The sound waves make a pattern of echoes as they bounce off organs inside your abdomen. The echoes create a picture of your kidney and nearby tissues. The picture can show a kidney tumor. CT scan: An x-ray machine linked to a computer takes a series of detailed pictures of your abdomen. You may receive an injection of contrast material so your urinary tract and lymph nodes show up clearly in the pictures. The CT scan can show cancer in the kidneys, lymph nodes, or elsewhere in the abdomen. MRI: A large machine with a strong magnet linked to a computer is used to make detailed pictures of your urinary tract and lymph nodes. You may receive an injection of contrast material. MRI can show cancer in your kidneys, lymph nodes, or other tissues in the abdomen. IVP: You'll receive an injection of dye into a vein in your arm. The dye travels through the body and collects in your kidneys. The dye makes them show up on x-rays. A series of x-rays then tracks the dye as it moves through your kidneys to your ureters and bladder. The x-rays can show a kidney tumor or other problems. (IVP is not used as commonly as CT or MRI for the detection of kidney cancer.) Biopsy: The removal of tissue to look for cancer cells is a biopsy. In some cases, your doctor will do a biopsy to diagnose kidney cancer. Your doctor inserts a thin needle through your skin into the kidney to remove a small sample of tissue. Your doctor may use ultrasound or a CT scan to guide the needle. A pathologist uses a microscope to check for cancer cells in the tissue. Surgery: After surgery to remove part or all of a kidney tumor, a pathologist can make the final diagnosis by checking the tissue under a microscope for cancer cells."
How is kidney cancer staging determined?,"'If kidney cancer is diagnosed, your doctor needs to learn the extent (stage) of the disease to help you choose the best treatment. The stage is based on the size of the kidney tumor and whether the cancer has invaded nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body.''Your doctor may order one or more tests:''When cancer spreads from its original place to another part of the body, the new tumor has the same kind of abnormal cells and the same name as the primary (original) tumor. For example, if kidney cancer spreads to a lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually kidney cancer cells. The disease is metastatic kidney cancer, not ''lung cancer'"". It's treated as kidney cancer, not as ""'lung cancer''. Doctors sometimes call the new tumor “distant” disease.''These are the stages of kidney cancer:''Common treatment options for people with kidney cancer are surgery, targeted therapy, and biological therapy. You may receive more than one type of treatment.'""The treatment that's right for you depends mainly on the following:""'You may have a team of specialists to help plan your treatment. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, or you may ask for a referral.''You may want to see a ''urologist'', a surgeon who specializes in treating problems of the urinary tract. Other specialists who treat kidney cancer include urologic oncologists (surgeons who specialize in cancers of the urinary tract), medical oncologists, and ''radiation'' oncologists. Your health care team may also include an ''oncology'' nurse and a registered dietitian.''Your health care team can describe your treatment choices, the expected results of each, and the possible side effects. Because cancer therapy often damages healthy cells and tissues, side effects are common. Before treatment starts, ask your health care team about possible side effects and how treatment may change your normal activities. You and your health care team can work together to develop a treatment plan that meets your needs.'""At any stage of disease, supportive care is available to control pain and other symptoms, to relieve the side effects of treatment, and to ease emotional concerns. Information about such care is available on NCI's Web site at http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/coping. For example, some people with kidney cancer may need to have radiation therapy to relieve pain or certain other problems. Radiation therapy uses highenergy rays to kill cancer cells.""'You may want to talk with your doctor about taking part in a clinical trial. ''Clinical trials'' are research studies testing new treatments. They are an important option for people with all stages of kidney cancer.''You may want to ask your doctor these questions before you begin treatment:'   Blood tests: Your doctor can check for substances in your blood. Some people with kidney cancer have high levels of calcium or LDH. A blood test can also show how well your liver is working. Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the chest can show a tumor in your lung. CT scan: CT scans of your chest and abdomen can show cancer in your lymph nodes, lungs, or elsewhere. MRI: MRI can show cancer in your blood vessels, lymph nodes, or other tissues in the abdomen. Stage I: The tumor is no bigger than a tennis ball (almost 3 inches or about 7 centimeters). Cancer cells are found only in the kidney. Stage II: The tumor is bigger than a tennis ball. But cancer cells are found only in the kidney. Stage III: The tumor can be any size. It has spread to at least one nearby lymph node. Or it has grown through the kidney to reach nearby blood vessels.

What are kidney cancer treatments?,"'Surgery is the most common treatment for people with kidney cancer. The type of surgery depends on the size and stage of the cancer, whether you have two kidneys, and whether cancer was found in both kidneys.''You and your surgeon can talk about the types of surgery and which may be right for you:'""There are two approaches for removing the kidney. The surgeon may remove the tumor by making a large incision into your body (open surgery). Or the surgeon may remove the tumor by making small incisions (laparoscopic surgery). The surgeon sees inside your abdomen with a thin, lighted tube (a laparoscope) placed inside a small incision. Sometimes a robot is used. The surgeon uses handles below a computer display to control the robot's arms.""""The surgeon may use other methods of destroying the cancer in the kidney.

After surgery, your doctor can adjust the plan if you need more pain control.''Your health care team will watch you for signs of bleeding, infection, or other problems. They will keep track of how much fluid you take in and how much urine passes out of your body.'""If one kidney is removed, the remaining kidney is usually able to do the work of both kidneys. However, if your remaining kidney isn't doing a good job cleaning your blood, you may need dialysis. Some people may need a transplant with a healthy kidney from a donor.""'You may want to ask your doctor these questions before having surgery:' Removing all of the kidney (radical nephrectomy): The surgeon removes the entire kidney along with the adrenal gland and some tissue around the kidney. Some lymph nodes in the area may also be removed. Removing part of the kidney (partial nephrectomy): The surgeon removes only the part of the kidney that contains the tumor. People with a kidney tumor that is smaller than a tennis ball may choose this type of surgery. Cryosurgery: The surgeon inserts a tool through a small incision or directly through the skin into the tumor. The tool freezes and kills the kidney tumor. Radiofrequency ablation: The surgeon inserts a special probe directly through the skin or through a small incision into the tumor. The probe contains tiny electrodes that kill the kidney cancer cells with heat. What type of surgery do you suggest for me? Do you recommend surgery that is through a large incision?

Targeted Therapy,"'People with kidney cancer that has spread may receive a type of drug called targeted therapy. Many kinds of targeted therapy are used for kidney cancer. This treatment may shrink a kidney tumor or slow its growth.''Usually, the targeted therapy is taken by mouth. You may feel very tired while taking targeted therapy for kidney cancer. Other side effects may include ''diarrhea'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', sores on the lips or in the mouth, and ''high blood pressure''.' "
Biological Therapy,"""People with kidney cancer that has spread may receive biological therapy.

The treatment may be given at the hospital or a doctor's office.""'Other ''drugs'' may be given at the same time to prevent side effects. The side effects differ with the biological therapy used, and from person to person. Biological therapy commonly causes a ''rash'' or swelling. You may feel very tired during treatment. The treatment may also cause a ''headache'', muscle aches, a fever, or weakness.''You may want to ask your doctor these questions about targeted therapy or biological therapy:' Why do I need this treatment?

Are there any lasting side effects? What can I do about them?"
Second Opinion,"'Before starting treatment, you may want a second opinion about your diagnosis, stage of cancer, and treatment plan. Some people worry that the doctor will be offended if they ask for a second opinion. Usually the opposite is true. Most doctors welcome a second opinion. And many health insurance companies will pay for a second opinion if you or your doctor requests it. Some companies require a second opinion.'""If you get a second opinion, the second doctor may agree with your first doctor's diagnosis and treatment plan. Or the second doctor may suggest another approach. Either way, you have more information and perhaps a greater sense of control. You can feel more confident about the decisions you make, knowing that you've looked at all of your options.""""It may take some time and effort to gather your medical records and see another doctor. In most cases, it's not a problem to take several weeks to get a second opinion. The delay in starting treatment usually will not make treatment less effective. To make sure, you should discuss this delay with your doctor.""'There are many ways to find a doctor for a second opinion. You can ask your doctor, a local or state medical society, a nearby hospital, or a medical school for names of specialists.'  "
Nutrition,"""It's important for you to take very good care of yourself before, during, and after cancer treatment. Taking care of yourself includes eating well so that you get the right amount of calories to maintain a good weight. You also need enough protein to keep up your strength. Eating well may help you feel better and have more energy.""""Sometimes, especially during or soon after treatment, you may not feel like eating. You may be uncomfortable or tired. You may find that foods don't taste as good as they used to. In addition, the side effects of some treatments (such as poor appetite, nausea, or vomiting) can make it hard to eat well.""'Your doctor, a registered dietitian, or another health care provider can suggest ways to help you meet your ''nutrition'' needs.' "
Follow-up Care,"""You'll need regular checkups (such as every 6 months) after treatment for kidney cancer. Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted and treated if needed.""'Kidney cancer may come back after treatment. Your doctor will check for return of cancer. Checkups may include blood tests, a chest x-ray, CT scans, or an ultrasound.'  "
Sources of Support,"""Learning that you have kidney cancer can change your life and the lives of those close to you. These changes can be hard to handle. It's normal for you, your family, and your friends to need help coping with the feelings that a diagnosis of cancer can bring.""'Concerns about treatments and managing side effects, hospital stays, and medical bills are common. You may also worry about caring for your family, keeping your job, or continuing daily activities.'""Here's where you can go for support:"" Doctors, nurses, and other members of your health care team can answer questions about treatment, working, or other activities. Social workers, counselors, or members of the clergy can be helpful if you want to talk about your feelings or concerns. Often, social workers can suggest resources for financial aid, transportation, home care, or emotional support. Support groups also can help. In these groups, patients or their family members meet with other patients or their families to share what they have learned about coping with cancer and the effects of treatment. Groups may offer support in person, over the telephone, or on the Internet. You may want to talk with a member of your health care team about finding a support group."
Taking Part in Cancer Research,"'Doctors all over the world are conducting many types of clinical trials (research studies in which people volunteer to take part). Clinical trials are designed to find out whether new treatments are safe and effective.''Even if the people in a trial do not benefit directly from a treatment, they may still make an important contribution by helping doctors learn more about kidney cancer and how to control it. Although clinical trials may pose some risks, doctors do all they can to protect their patients.'""Doctors are studying new targeted therapies and drug combinations for kidney cancer. If you're interested in being part of a clinical trial, talk with your doctor."" "
What are the kidneys? Where are they located?,"'The kidneys play key roles in body function, not only by filtering the blood and getting rid of waste products, but also by balancing the electrolyte levels in the body, controlling blood pressure, and stimulating the production of ''red blood cells''.''The kidneys are located in the abdomen toward the back, normally one on each side of the spine. They get their blood supply through the renal arteries directly from the ''aorta'' and send blood back to the ''heart'' via the renal veins to the vena cava. (The term ""renal"" is derived from the Latin name for kidney.)' "
What do the kidneys do?,"'When blood flows to the kidney, sensors within specialized kidney cells regulate how much water to excrete as urine, along with what concentration of ''electrolytes''. For example, if a person is dehydrated from ''exercise'' or from an illness, the kidneys will hold onto as much water as possible and the urine becomes very concentrated. When adequate water is present in the body, the urine is much more dilute, and the urine becomes clear. This system is controlled by renin, a hormone produced in the kidney that is part of the fluid and blood pressure regulation systems of the body.''Kidneys are also the source of ''erythropoietin'' in the body, a hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to make red blood cells. Special cells in the kidney monitor the oxygen concentration in blood. If oxygen levels fall, erythropoietin levels rise and the body starts to manufacture more red blood cells.''Urine that is made by each kidney flows through the ureter, a tube that connects the kidney to the bladder. Urine is stored within the bladder, and when urination occurs, the bladder empties urine through a tube called the urethra.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of kidney failure?,"'Initially, kidney failure may be not produce any symptoms (asymptomatic). As kidney function decreases, the symptoms are related to the inability to regulate water and electrolyte balances, clear waste products from the body, and promote red blood cell production.''If unrecognized or untreated, the following symptoms of kidney failure may develop into life-threatening circumstances.'   Lethargy Weakness Shortness of breath Generalized swelling (edema) Generalized weakness due to anemia Loss of appetite Lethargy Fatigue Congestive heart failure Metabolic acidosis High blood potassium (hyperkalemia) Fatal heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias) including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation Rising urea levels in the blood (uremia) may lead to brain encephalopathy, pericarditis (inflammation of the heart lining), or low calcium blood levels (hypocalcemia)"
What causes kidney failure?,"'Kidney failure may occur from an acute situation that injures the kidneys or from chronic diseases that gradually cause the kidneys to stop functioning.''In ''acute renal failure'"", kidney function is lost rapidly and can occur from a variety of insults to the body. Since most people have two kidneys, both kidneys must be damaged for complete kidney failure to occur. Fortunately, if only one kidney fails or is diseased it can be removed, and the remaining kidney may continue to have normal kidney (renal) function. If a both patient's kidneys are injured or diseased, a donor kidney(s) may transplanted.""'The list of causes of kidney failure is often categorized based on where the injury has occurred.''Prerenal causes'' (pre=before + renal=kidney) causes are due to decreased blood supply to the kidney. Examples of ''prerenal causes of kidney failure'' are:' Hypovolemia (low blood volume) due to blood loss Dehydration from loss of body fluid (for example, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, fever) Poor intake of fluids Medication, for example, diuretics (""water pills"") may cause excessive water loss Abnormal blood flow to and from the kidney due to obstruction of the renal artery or vein."
What causes acute kidney failure?,"'Renal causes of kidney failure (damage directly to the kidney itself) include:''Sepsis'':'"" The body's immune system is overwhelmed from infection and causes inflammation and shutdown of the kidneys. This usually does not occur with simple ""'urinary tract infections''.''Medications:'' Some medications are toxic to the kidney including:''Rhabdomyolysis'':'' In rhabdomyolysis there is significant muscle breakdown in the body, and the damaged muscle fibers clog the filtering system of the kidneys. Massive muscle injury may occur because of ''trauma'', crush injuries, and ''burns''. Some medications used to treat ''high cholesterol'' may cause rhabdomyolysis.''Multiple myeloma''Acute glomerulonephritis or inflammation of the glomeruli, the filtering system of the kidneys. Many diseases can cause this inflammation including:''Hemolytic uremic syndrome'':'' This condition results from abnormal destruction of red blood cells. It most often occurs in children after certain infections, but also may be caused by medications, ''pregnancy'', or can occur for unknown reasons.''Post renal causes of kidney failure'' (post=after + renal= kidney) are due to factors that affect outflow of the urine:' Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, and others), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) Antibiotics like aminoglycosides gentamicin (Garamycin), tobramycin lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid) Iodine-containing medications such as those injected for radiology dye studies Systemic lupus erythematosus Wegener's granulomatosis Goodpasture syndrome. Obstruction of the bladder or the ureters can cause back pressure because the kidneys continue to produce urine, but the obstruction acts like a dam, and urine backs up into the kidneys. When the pressure increases high enough, the kidneys are damaged and shut down. Prostatic hypertrophy or prostate cancer may block the urethra and prevents the bladder from emptying. Tumors in the abdomen that surround and obstruct the ureters. Kidney stones. Usually, kidney stones affect only one kidney and do not cause kidney failure. However, if there is only one kidney present, a kidney stone may cause the remaining kidney to fail."
What causes chronic kidney failure?,"'Chronic renal failure'' develops over months and years. The most common causes of chronic renal failure are related to''Less common causes of chronic renal failure include:' poorly controlled diabetes, poorly controlled high blood pressure, and chronic glomerulonephritis. Polycystic kidney disease Reflux nephropathy (damage caused by urine backflow from the bladder into the ureters and kidney) Nephrotic syndrome Alport's disease Interstitial nephritis Kidney stones Prostate disease"
Does kidney failure cause pain?,"'Kidney failure in itself does not cause ''pain''. However, the consequences of kidney failure may cause ''pain'' and discomfort in different parts of the body.''Normal functioning kidneys filter amyloid (a protein) from the blood stream. In kidney failure amyloid proteins in the blood rise, and can separate and clump together forming amyloid deposits into a variety of tissue and organs, including joints and tendons. This can result in symptoms of:' joint stiffness, pain, and swelling. Patients who are on dialysis may have discomfort when on the dialysis machine. Pain is often a consequence of the underlying chronic disease that led to kidney failure, for example: People with poorly controlled diabetes may develop diabetic neuropathy pain. People who have peripheral vascular disease also may have pain in their extremities, and may develop claudication (leg pain that occurs with walking)."
What procedures and tests diagnose kidney failure?,"""Often, a patient is seen for another medical condition and the diagnosis of kidney failure is a consequence of the patient's disease or injury. In patients with chronic kidney disease due to diabetes, ""'high blood pressure'', or another related medical condition his or her medical care team most likely monitors kidney function as part of the his or her routine long-term medical care plan.''Diagnosis of kidney failure can be confirmed by blood tests such as BUN, creatinine, and GFR; that measure the buildup of waste products in the blood.''Urine tests may be ordered to measure the amount of protein, detect the presence of abnormal cells, or measure the concentration of electrolytes.''Other tests are used to diagnose the type of kidney failure such as:'   Abdominal ultrasound Kidney biopsy"
What is the treatment for kidney failure?,"'Prevention'' is always the goal with kidney failure. Chronic diseases such as ''hypertension'' (''high blood pressure'') and diabetes are devastating because of the damage that they can do to kidneys and other organs. Lifelong diligence is important in keeping blood ''sugar'' and blood pressure within normal limits. Specific treatments depend upon the underlying diseases.''Once kidney failure is present, the goal is to prevent further deterioration of renal function. If ignored, the kidneys will progress to complete failure, but if underlying illnesses are addressed and treated aggressively, kidney function can be preserved, though not always improved.'  "
Is there a diet for kidney failure? What foods should be avoided? Which are OK to eat?,"'Diet'' is an important consideration for those with impaired kidney function. Consultation with a dietician may be helpful to understand what foods may or may not be appropriate.''In this state of impaired kidney function, the kidneys cannot easily remove excess water, salt, or potassium from the blood, so foods high in potassium salt substitutes may need to be consumed in limited quantities. Examples of potassium rich foods include:''Phosphorus is a forgotten chemical that is associated with calcium metabolism and may be elevated in the body in kidney failure. Too much phosphorus can leech calcium from the bones and cause ''osteoporosis'' and ''fractures''. Examples of foods and ''beverages'' high in phosphorus include:'   Bananas Apricots Cantaloupe Sweet potatoes Yogurt Spinach Avocados Milk Cheese Nuts Dark cola drinks Canned iced teas Yogurt Organ meets Sardines Oysters Baked beans Black beans Lentils Kidney beans Soy beans Bran cereals Caramels Whole grain products"
What medications treat kidney failure?,"'Different classes of medications may be used to help control some of the issues associated with kidney failure including:''Once the kidneys fail completely, the treatment options are limited to dialysis or kidney replacement by transplantation.' Phosphorus-lowering medications, for example, calcium carbonate (Caltrate), calcitriol (Rocaltrol), and sevelamer (Renagel) Red blood cell production stimulation, for example, erythropoietin, darbepoetin (Aranesp) Red blood cell production (iron supplements) Blood pressure medications Vitamins"
What are dialysis and hemodialysis?,"'Dialysis cleanses the body of waste products in the body by use of filter systems. There are two types of dialysis, 1) ''hemodialysis'', and 2) peritoneal dialysis.''Hemodialysis uses a machine filter called a dialyzer or artificial kidney to remove excess water and salt, to balance the other electrolytes in the body, and to remove waste products of metabolism. Blood is removed from the body and flows through tubing into the machine, where it passes next to a filter membrane. A specialized chemical solution (dialysate) flows on the other side of the membrane. The dialysate is formulated to draw impurities from the blood through the filter membrane. Blood and dialysate never touch in the artificial kidney machine.''For this type of dialysis, access to the blood vessels needs to be surgically created so that large amounts of blood can flow into the machine and back to the body. Surgeons can build a fistula, a connection between a large artery and vein in the body, usually in the arm, that allows a large amount of blood flow into the vein. This makes the vein swell or dilate, and its walls become thicker so that it can tolerate repeated needle sticks to attach tubing from the body to the machine. Since it takes many weeks or months for a fistula to mature enough to be used, significant planning is required if hemodialysis is to be considered as an option.''If the kidney failure happens acutely and there is no time to build a fistula, special catheters may be inserted into the larger blood vessels of the arm, leg, or chest. These catheters may be left in place for weeks. In some diseases, the need for dialysis will be temporary, but if the expectation is that dialysis will continue for a prolonged period of time, these catheters act as a ''bridge'' until a fistula can be planned, placed, and matured.''Dialysis treatments normally occur three times a week and last a few hours at a time. Most commonly, patients travel to an outpatient center to have dialysis, but home dialysis therapy is becoming an option for some.''Outpatient dialysis is available on some cruise ships. They are equipped with dialysis machines with trained health care professionals ready to care for those with kidney failure while traveling.'  "
What is peritoneal dialysis?,"'Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of the abdominal ''cavity'' as the dialysis filter to rid the body of waste and to balance electrolyte levels. A catheter is placed in the abdominal ''cavity'' through the abdominal wall by a surgeon, and it is expected to remain in place for the long-term. The dialysis solution is then dripped in through the catheter and left in the abdominal cavity for a few hours after which, it is drained out. During that time, waste products leech from the blood flowing through the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum), and attach themselves to the fluid that has been instilled by the catheters. Often, patients instill the dialysate fluid before bedtime, and drain it in the morning.'""There are benefits and complications for each type of dialysis. Not every patient can choose which type he or she would prefer. The treatment decision depends on the patient's illness and their past medical history along with other issues. Usually, the nephrologist (kidney specialist) will have a long discussion with the patient and family to decide what will be the best option available.""'Dialysis is lifesaving. Without it, patients whose kidneys no longer function would die relatively quickly due to electrolyte abnormalities and the buildup of toxins in the blood stream. Patients may live many years with dialysis but other underlying and associated illnesses often are the cause of death.' "
Is a kidney transplant an option?,"'If kidney failure occurs and is non-reversible, kidney transplantation is an alternative option to dialysis. If the patient is an appropriate candidate, the healthcare professional and nephrologist will contact an organ transplant center to arrange evaluation to see whether the patient is suitable for this treatment. If so, the search for a donor begins. Sometimes, family members have compatible tissue types and, if they are willing, may donate a kidney. Otherwise, the patient will be placed on the organ transplant list that is maintained by the United Network of Organ Sharing.''Not all hospitals are capable of performing kidney transplants. The patient may have to travel to undergo their operation. The most successful programs are those that do many transplants every year.''While kidney transplants have become routine, they still carry some risk. The patient will need to take anti-rejection medications that reduce the ability of the immune system to fight infection. The body can try to reject the kidney or the transplanted kidney may fail to work. As with any operation, there is a risk of bleeding and infection.''Kidney transplants may provide better quality of life than dialysis. After one year, 95% of transplanted kidneys are still functioning and after five years, the number is 80%. It seems that the longer a patient is on dialysis, the shorter the life of the transplanted kidney.''If the transplanted kidney fails, the alternative is another kidney transplant or a return to dialysis.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for kidney failure? Can it be prevented?,"'The outlook for kidney failure depends upon the underlying condition that caused it. Kidney function may return to normal, especially if it is due to an acute obstruction and that obstruction is relieved. Other causes of decreased kidney function leading to kidney failure are due to underlying disease and occur slowly over time.''Prevention is the best chance to maintain kidney function, and controlling ''high blood pressure'' and diabetes over a lifetime can decrease the potential for progressive kidney damage. Chronic kidney failure may be managed by to help monitor electrolyte and waste product levels in the bloodstream. Major abnormalities can be life threatening, and treatment options may be limited to dialysis or transplant.' "
What are repetitive motion disorders (RMDs?," Repetitive motion disorders (RMDs) are a family of muscular conditions that result from repeated motions performed in the course of normal work or daily activities. RMDs includecarpal tunnel syndrome,bursitis,tendonitis,epicondylitis,ganglion cyst,tenosynovitis, andtrigger finger. carpal tunnel syndrome, bursitis, tendonitis, epicondylitis, ganglion cyst, tenosynovitis, and trigger finger. RMDs are caused by too many uninterrupted repetitions of an activity or motion, unnatural or awkward motions such as twisting the arm or wrist, overexertion, incorrect posture, or muscle fatigue. RMDs occur most commonly in the hands, wrists, elbows, and shoulders, but can also happen in the neck, back, hips, knees, feet, legs, and ankles. The disorders are characterized by pain, tingling, numbness, visible swelling or redness of the affected area, and the loss of flexibility and strength. For some individuals, there may be no visible sign of injury, although they may find it hard to perform easy tasks. Over time, RMDs can cause temporary or permanent damage to the soft tissues in the body -- such as the muscles, nerves, tendons, and ligaments - and compression of nerves or tissue. Generally, RMDs affect individuals who perform repetitive tasks such as assembly line work, meat-packing, sewing, playing musical instruments, and computer work. The disorders may also affect individuals who engage in activities such as carpentry, gardening, and tennis."
Is there any treatment for repetitive motion disorders?," Treatment for RMDs usually includes reducing or stopping the motions that cause symptoms. Options include taking breaks to give the affected area time to rest, and adopting stretching and relaxation exercises. Applying ice to the affected area and using medications such as pain relievers, cortisone, and anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce pain and swelling. Splints may be able to relieve pressure on the muscles and nerves. Physical therapy may relieve the soreness and pain in the muscles and joints. In rare cases, surgery may be required to relieve symptoms and prevent permanent damage. Some employers have developed ergonomic programs to help workers adjust their pace of work and arrange office equipment to minimize problems."
What is the prognosis for repetitive motion disorders?," Most individuals with RMDs recover completely and can avoid re-injury by changing the way they perform repetitive movements, the frequency with which they perform them, and the amount of time they rest between movements. Without treatment, RMDs may result in permanent injury and complete loss of function in the affected area."
What research is being done?,'Much of the on-going research on RMDs is aimed at ''prevention'' and rehabilitation. The National Institute of ''Arthritis'' and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) funds research on RMDs.''Select this link'' to view a list of studies currently seeking patients.''Source: National Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov)' 
Menstruation and Menopause,"'The ''menstrual cycle'"" is the process by which a woman's body gets ready for the chance of a ""'pregnancy'' each month. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days from the start of one to the start of the next, but it can range from 21 days to 35 days.''Most menstrual periods last from three to five days. In the United States, most girls start menstruating at age 12, but girls can start menstruating between the ages of 8 and 16. ''Menopause'' is the absence of menstrual periods for 12 months. The menopausal transition begins with varying menstrual cycle lengths and ends with the final ''menstruation''.' "
Pregnancy and preconception care,"'Pregnancy is the term used to describe when a woman has a growing fetus inside of her. In most cases, the fetus grows in the uterus.''Human pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks, or just more than 9 months, from the start of the ''last menstrual period'' to ''childbirth''.''Prenatal care'' is the care woman gets during a pregnancy. Getting early and regular ''prenatal'' care is important for the health of both mother and the developing baby.''In addition, health care providers are now recommending a woman see a health care provider for preconception care, even before she considers ''becoming pregnant'' or in between ''pregnancies''.''Both preconception care and prenatal care help to promote the best health outcomes for mother and baby.' "
Fertility and Infertility,"'Infertility'' is the term health care providers use for women who are unable to get ''pregnant'', and for men who are unable to impregnate a woman, after at least one year of trying.'""In women, the term is used to describe those who are of normal childbearing age, not those who can't get pregnant because they are near or past ""'menopause''. Women who are able to get pregnant but who cannot carry a pregnancy to term (birth) may also be considered ''infertile''.''Infertility'' is a complex problem – it does not have a single cause because ''getting pregnant'' is a multi-step chain of events. The cause of infertility can rest in the women or the man, or can be from unknown factors or a combination of factors.' "
Contraception,"'Contraception'', also known as ''birth control'', is designed to prevent pregnancy. Some types of ''birth control'' include (but are not limited to):'""The choice of birth control depends on factors such as a person's overall health, age, frequency of sexual activity, number of sexual partners, desire to have children in the future, and family history of certain diseases. A woman should talk to her health care provider about her choice of birth control method."" Barrier methods, such as condoms, the 
	diaphragm, and 
the cervical cap, are designed to prevent the sperm from reaching the egg for 
	fertilization. Intrauterine device, or IUD, is a small device that is inserted into the 
uterus by a health care provider. The IUD prevents a fertilized egg from 
implanting in the uterus. An IUD can stay in the uterus for up to 10 years until 
it is removed by a health care provider. Hormonal birth control, such as
	birth control pills, injections, skin 
patches, and vaginal rings, release hormones into a woman's body that interfere 
with fertility by preventing 
	ovulation, fertilization, or 
	implantation. Sterilization is a method that permanently prevents a woman from getting 
pregnant or a man from being able to get a woman pregnant. Sterilization 
involves surgical procedures that must be done by a health care provider and 
usually cannot be reversed."
Sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS/HIV,"'It is important to remember that even though ''birth control methods'' can prevent pregnancy, they do not all protect against ''sexually transmitted diseases'' or ''HIV''.''SOURCE: National Institute of Child and Health and Human Development; ''""Reproductive Health.""' "
What is clinical research?,"'Clinical research is a type of study of clinical or biomedical questions through the use of human subjects. Clinical research studies do not necessarily all involve medical treatments or experimental therapies. Clinical research can include observational studies, in which people are followed over a period of time to determine health outcomes. Clinical research may also be used to determine the usefulness or safety of a new diagnostic procedure or drug treatment. Clinical research studies are planned in advance and follow a defined protocol. Epidemiologic studies examine specific populations to clarify how often a disease occurs or is found in a given group (the incidence and prevalence), the individual factors that can cause or worsen disease progression, and the types of health and lifestyle decisions that people make. Clinical trials (see below) are one important type of clinical research.' "
Why is clinical research important?,"'Clinical research is important in order to develop new therapies and diagnostic procedures as well as to understand how diseases begin and progress. Observational studies may help identify risk factors for the development of a particular disease, such as the association between ''smoking'' and ''lung cancer''. Outcomes-based research can help doctors identify the most effective therapies and treatments for a number of conditions. Another aspect of clinical research is the development of new technologies for use in health care, ranging from surgical tools and materials to ''hearing'' aids and artificial limbs. In ''cancer'' treatment, virtually all advances in the care of ''cancer'' patients has occurred as a result of clinical research.' "
What are clinical trials?,"'Clinical trials are a form of clinical research that follow a defined protocol that has been carefully developed to evaluate a clinical question. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines a clinical trial as''Although people commonly associate clinical trials with drug trials, in which new medications or combinations of drugs are tested for their effectiveness against a disease, clinical trials may also evaluate whether interventions such as counseling or lifestyle modifications have an effect on disease progression. Clinical trials may be conducted on people who have a disease or on healthy people, depending upon the purpose of the research.''The U.S. NIH describes the following types of clinical trials:'  ""a prospective biomedical or behavioral research study of human subjects that is designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions (such as drugs, treatments, devices, or new ways of using known drugs, treatments, or devices)."" Treatment trials test new treatments, new combinations of drugs, or new techniques in surgery or radiation therapy. Prevention trials are designed to identify ways to prevent disease through the use of medicines, lifestyle changes, dietary supplements such as vitamins, or immunizations. Diagnostic trials aim to identify improvements in tests or methods used to diagnose disease. Screening trials look for ways to detect specific conditions before the patient has any symptoms of the disease. Quality of life trials (also referred to as supportive-care trials) are trials that are designed to improve comfort and the quality of life for people suffering from chronic conditions or diseases."
What are the phases of a clinical trial?,"""Clinical trials are broken down into phases, with each phase having a different purpose within the trial. Phase I trials involve a small group of people (20-80) and are concerned with determining a safe dose of the drug being studied as well as its potential side effects. In Phase II, the treatment or drug is tested in more people (100-300) for further evaluation - this time, determining the time of the drug or treatment's effectiveness against the disease for which the patient is being treated. Even more people (1,000-3,000) are participants in Phase III of a trial, when the intervention is compared to standard treatments and further information is collected about safety and side effects. In Phase IV trials, conducted after a treatment has been approved for specific indicated conditions by the FDA, post-marketing studies are carried out to collect more information about the optimal use of the drug or treatment and to further evaluate its side effects. ""'Clinical trials may be carried out in different locations, including hospitals, clinics, individual physician practices, university health centers, or community health centers.' "
How can one find out what clinical trials are currently being conducted?,'The web site ''http://clinicaltrials.gov'' is a searchable database of federally and privately funded clinical trials being conducted in the U.S. and around the world. Your doctor or health-care team may also offer information about clinical trials that are currently under way for your specific condition. ' 
"How is a clinical trial performed, and what sort of preparation is needed?","""Before a clinical trial can be carried out, thorough preparation is necessary, including extensive reviews of the proposed trial, its methodology, and the goals of the trial. An Institutional Review Board (IRB) consisting of physicians, statisticians, researchers, patient advocates, and others must pre-approve every clinical trial in the U.S. The job of the IRB is to ensure that the trial is ethical, legal, and that the rights of those participating are fully protected. For example, individual participants' names are kept secret and not included in the results or publicly available information about a trial.""'Every clinical trial has a strictly defined protocol that is approved by the IRB. A protocol describes what types of people may participate in the trial; outlines the exact the schedule of tests, procedures, medications, and/or dosages involved in the trial; and specifies the length of the study. Generally, doctors check the patient thoroughly at the start of the trial, provide instructions and directions for participation in the trial, monitor the patient during the actual trial, and remain in contact, sometimes with further monitoring after the trial is completed. ''In many clinical trials, patients will be randomly assigned to a test group or a control group. The control group receives the standard and accepted treatment for a given condition, while the test group receives the experimental medication or treatment to be evaluated. When a trial is ""double-blinded,"" neither the participants nor the treating doctors know if an individual patient is receiving the standard treatment versus the experimental treatment. Double-blinded trials offer the advantage of allowing the treating health-care team and the patient to make unbiased observations about patient progress and the effectiveness of the treatment being evaluated. A double-blind study is also referred to as a double-masked study. Results obtained from a randomized, double blind clinical trial are considered the most accurate and reliable types of results, and help those conducting the trial to draw the most accurate conclusions.' "
What is informed consent?,"'Informed consent is giving your consent to participate in the clinical trial after having learned about the trial and having had the opportunity to ask questions. You should be fully aware of all the details, risks vs. benefits, and expectations of the trial before agreeing to participate. When you give informed consent, you sign a document - which should be in a language that you understand - that describes the rights of the participants as well as gives details of the study and names of the investigators who are conducting the study and contact information for these people. ' "
Is patient privacy maintained in a clinical trial?,"'Clinical trials are required to maintain strict patient privacy. Your name will not be published anywhere that data about the trial are published or included in any publicly available information. Some clinical trials may require that you be seen and examined by a larger treatment team than would typical medical care. For example, this may include research nurses who only see patients enrolled on clinical trials.' "
Who can participate in a clinical trial?,"'Each trial has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine the exact patient populations that may participate. Individuals who fit the predefined and preapproved inclusion criteria for a trial may participate if the trial is currently accepting participants. Inclusion criteria are based on factors such as patient age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions. Some clinical trials seek participants with illnesses or conditions to be studied in the clinical trial, while others need healthy participants. ' "
Are people paid for participating in clinical trials?,"'Some clinical trials offer monetary compensation for participants. Other trials may offer their participants free health care that is related to the condition being studied, or screening examinations. There are no requirements for those who sponsor clinical trials to pay or otherwise compensate participants.' "
What are the pros and cons of participating in a clinical trial?,"""The benefits of clinical trials are many and range from taking an active role in the management of one's own health care, helping others by aiding the process of knowledge acquisition and development of enhanced treatments, being cared for by - or in accordance with the protocol which has been developed by - leading health care teams in a given field, and in some cases, receiving access to new treatments before they are approved. However, there are also risks, including side effects of drugs and risks of any procedures that may be performed. In some cases, clinical-trial participation may require more frequent doctor visits or hospitalizations than standard care, and you may have to travel to a study site that is farther away than your local health-care practitioner's office.""'Some questions you may want to ask before participating in a clinical trial include the following:' What is the purpose of the trial? Is a new type of treatment being tested? How does this differ from the accepted or standard therapy for my condition? Has the drug or treatment ever been tested before? How will participation impact my daily life and schedule? Will it be necessary to be in the hospital? What are the risks and possible side effects of the treatment? Who will pay for the treatments? Will I receive reimbursement or any type of compensation for my time or expenses? How long is the trial expected to last? How will I receive results of the trial, and how will I know if the treatment is successful?"
Can a person leave a clinical trial once it has started?,'An informed consent document is not a legal contract that requires participation in a study for the length of a study. A participant is free to leave a clinical trial at any time without prejudice to their ongoing medical care. They will not have access to the experimental medicine being studied if they leave the trial.' 
Who sponsors clinical trials?,"""Clinical trials can be sponsored or funded by a variety of organizations or individuals. Federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA) frequently fund and sponsor clinical trials. Additionally, clinical trials may be sponsored by medical institutions, charitable foundations, advocacy groups, physicians, and/or biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. "" "
What happens after a clinical trial is completed? Is there follow-up care?,"'The researchers in the trial will stay in contact with participants and inform them of the conclusions of the trial. In some cases, you may be asked to provide long-term follow-up in the form of patient surveys or periodic health examinations. Since most clinical trials provide short-term treatments related to a specific condition, they are not a substitute for primary health care. Your regular health-care provider should be aware of the trial and will work with the researchers during the trial. When the trial is over, you will continue to receive care through your primary care provider and any other practitioners required for your condition.'  "
What is liver resection and why is it done?,'Liver'' resection is the surgical removal of a portion of the liver. This operation is usually done to remove various types of liver tumors that are located in the resected portion of the liver. The goal of liver resection is to completely remove the ''tumor'' and the appropriate surrounding liver tissue without leaving any tumor behind.' 
Which patients with liver cancer undergo liver resection?,"'In patients with ''liver cancer'' (Hepatocellular ''Cancer'', HCC), liver resection is limited to patients with one or two small (5 cm or less) tumors confined to the liver with no invasion of the blood vessels. As a result of these strict guidelines, in practice, very few patients with HCC can undergo liver resection. The biggest concern about resection is that following the operation, the patient can develop liver failure. The liver failure can occur if the remaining portion of the liver is inadequate (for example, because of associated ''cirrhosis'') to provide the necessary support for life.'  "
What is the goal of liver resection?,"'The goal of liver resection is to completely remove the tumor and the appropriate surrounding liver tissue without leaving any tumor behind. This option is limited to patients with one or two small (3 cm or less) tumors and excellent ''liver function'', ideally without associated ''cirrhosis''. As a result of these strict guidelines, in practice, very few patients with liver ''cancer'' can undergo liver resection. The biggest concern about resection is that following the operation, the patient can develop liver failure.' "
Can a portion of the remaining normal liver grow back?,"'When a portion of a normal liver is removed, the remaining liver can grow back (regenerate) to the original size within several weeks. A cirrhotic liver, however, cannot grow back. Therefore, before resection is performed for HCC, the non-tumor portion of the liver should be biopsied to determine whether there is associated cirrhosis.' "
What are the results (survival and recurrence) of liver resection?,"'For HCC patients whose tumors are successfully resected, the five-year survival is about 10% to 60%, depending on the tumor size and type. This means that 10% to 60 % of patients who actually undergo liver resection for liver ''cancer'' are expected to live five years. Many of these patients, however, will have a recurrence of liver cancer elsewhere in the liver. Moreover, it should be noted that the survival rate of untreated patients with similar sized tumors and similar liver function is probably comparable. Some studies from Europe and Japan have shown that survival rates with ''alcohol'' injection or ''radiofrequency ablation'' procedures are comparable to the survival rates of those patients who underwent resection. But again, the reader should be cautioned that there are no head-to-head comparisons of these procedures versus resection.' "
What is epilepsy?,"'An epileptic ''seizure'' is a sudden and transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms that are the result of an abnormal activity of the brain. Epileptic ''seizures'' are the common and defining component of the disorder that is referred to as epilepsy. The diagnosis of epilepsy implies that there is an abnormality in the brain and that this abnormality will result in more epileptic seizures. That is, an individual that has an isolated seizure as a result of an acute transient insult to the brain, for example a metabolic disorder, or a seizure observed after an acute ''trauma'' to the brain, would not be diagnosed as having epilepsy. In other words, epilepsy is the tendency to have repeated spontaneous seizures. '  "
What are the different types of clinical seizures?,"'There are different ''types of seizures'', which traditionally have been categorized as either generalized seizures or partial seizures. Generalized seizures are those in which the clinical manifestations indicate that the whole brain is involved from the beginning of the seizure. Partial seizures (local, focal) are those in which the epileptic event is limited to one part of the body or to a particular function of the brain, indicating that the epileptic seizure started in one limited area of the brain. Partial seizures may remain focal or may expand to the rest of the brain. When seizures expand to the rest of the brain these are referred to as secondary generalized seizures. Consciousness is always impaired in generalized seizures; however, in the case of partial seizures consciousness may be preserved , as in the so-called simple partial seizures, or it may be impaired, as is the case with the complex partial seizures.''Among the generalized seizures, the ''generalized tonic clonic seizure'' (traditionally recognized as a ''grand mal'' seizure) is the most common type. In this seizure there is a succession of muscle contractions (tonic component), more obvious in the extremities but affecting almost every muscle of the body, followed by sudden relaxation (clonic component) and further followed by another tonic component. This succession of events is repeated several times.''Simultaneously, there are other signs and symptoms including dilatation of the pupils, increased ''heart'' rate, and increased ''blood pressure''. ''Cyanosis'' (skin and lips ''turning blue''-purple) is also seen due to persistent contraction of the ''diaphragm'' muscle and holding of the breath. These convulsions are usually followed by a period of ''confusion''. In most instances these seizures, as well as most of the epileptic seizures, last for a few seconds or at the most for 2-3 minutes. Occasionally the seizure event may be prolonged, lasting several minutes. By definition, when the event lasts more than 30 minutes, it is described as status epilepticus.''Another type of generalized seizure is the '' ''absence seizure'', also called petit mal seizure, because the clinical symptoms are not as dramatic as with the generalized tonic clonic seizures. In the absence seizures, as the name implies, the patient looks absent, like ""not being here."" With this type of seizure there is a sudden interruption of activities, and the patient becomes unresponsive. Usually these seizures, particularly when they last longer than a few seconds, are associated with other subtle clinical signs such as eye blinking or twitching in the face or upper body. There is almost no confusion after these seizures, and the patient returns to his/her activities without even acknowledging that a seizure has occurred.''In the ''atonic seizures'' (drop attacks) there is a sudden loss of muscle activity, like a sudden ''paralysis''. The patient will collapse like a marionette when all its strings are cut at once. If these seizures happen when the individual is ''walking'', a fall will result, or if the patient is seated, he/she will experience a sudden drop of the head, usually without the motor reflexes that help people to prevent injuries. These seizures are very brief and might result in serious injuries, most often to the forehead, mouth, and/or face.''The ''myoclonic seizures'' consist of rapid, jerky contractions of isolated muscles or group of muscles which may or may not result in body movements.''The ''tonic seizures'' consist of a brief stiffening of the muscle groups, resulting most often in extension of the arms or legs or arching of the trunk. Some of these seizures might be associated with a forced ''exhalation'' of air, due to a sudden contraction of the expiratory muscle through partially contracted vocal cords, resulting in a loud sound.''With partial (focal, local) seizures, the clinical events originate in a limited area of the brain. The clinical manifestations depend upon the area of the brain that is abnormal. Many different clinical events can be seen with this type of seizure.''For example, with simple partial seizures (consciousness is not impaired) if the focal area of the brain involved is the motor area, the patient might have rhythmic contractions in one arm or leg. If the areas compromised are more involved with the visual system then the patient might complain of visual illusions.''Other abnormal sensations might be the result of lesions in the auditory, olfactory, or gustatory areas. Some other symptoms might include:''These patients are conscious when the symptoms occur, and their description of the symptoms can be very useful in determining which area of the brain is involved in the seizure. This has important implications for the selection of the appropriate treatment, especially for the decision about the need for surgery.''The complex partial seizures (sometimes called ""temporal lobe seizures"" or ""psychomotor seizures""), in which consciousness is impaired, have a greater range of symptoms. The symptoms already described in the simple partial seizures might be present and might be followed by complex automatic behaviors such as manipulating objects, walking around the room, or answering questions, usually done in a rumbling, difficult-to-understand language.' epigastric pain, sweating, pallor (paleness), flushing, pupillary dilatation, a sense of ""déjá vu,"" fear or anger."
What causes epilepsy in children?,"'Many different disorders of the brain may be associated with epilepsy.''For some patients the epileptic disorder is congenital, that is, the child is born with the predisposition to have epilepsy. In other patients, the epileptic disorder is acquired because of ''brain damage'' that occurred after birth.''The congenital epilepsies could be the result of the child having a gene that is responsible for the epileptic disorder; these are the genetic types of epilepsy. Alternatively, congenital epilepsy may be the result of factors that interfere with the development of the brain during gestation, resulting in brain malformations.''In acquired epileptic disorders, the damage might occur at the time of birth, for example the case of newborns that have oxygen deprivation during ''labor and delivery''; or intracranial bleeding, as seen in some children born prematurely. Also, the brain damage may occur any time after birth. For example, epilepsy could be a complication of infections in the brain (meningitis, ''encephalitis''), head injuries with brain damage, ''brain tumors'', or intracranial bleeding.' "
Are seizures bad for children?,"'Presently there is no indication that short-lasting seizures will result in any brain damage. However, prolonged seizures, especially generalized tonic-clonic seizures, in some cases could result in brain damage, but this is very unusual. ''Although brain damage is not likely, children can be injured at the time of the seizures. For example, in the atonic seizures there is a sudden loss of muscle power and, if this happens when the patient is standing, it is followed by a fall that might result in injuries to the face and/or mouth. Similar types of physical injuries can happen with other seizures.' "
How is epilepsy treated?,"'The main line of treatment is with antiepileptic ''drugs'', which are effective in controlling seizures in 70%-80% of patients with epilepsy. There are several antiepileptic medications. Since certain medications are much better for some seizures, the choice of the medication should be made by a physician who is familiar with these medications. If possible, the child should be evaluated in a center specializing in epilepsy. If this is not feasible, usually pediatric neurologists have training in epileptic disorders and are a good source for a referral.''When antiepileptic drugs fail to control the seizures, the patients may improve with surgical procedures.' "
Who is a candidate for epilepsy surgery?,"'Surgery is indicated in a small group of children.''It usually takes the failure of two or three antiepileptic medications before a child would be considered as a potential candidate for surgery. In general, this happens at least after two or three years of continuous treatment with medications. The failure might be due:'""Since surgical procedures might be very effective in some children, once it is clear that the child's epileptic disorder is not responding to treatment with antiepileptic medications, surgery should be considered. Young age is not a contraindication for surgery, and there is no benefit in waiting for the child to be older. In fact, there is considerable evidence that the younger a child is at the time of surgery, the better his/her potential will be for good function after the surgery. There is a certain degree of plasticity in the brain that helps with the recovery of functions that can be damaged at the time of surgery. This plasticity is higher in younger than in older children."" to a resistance to the antiepileptic medications that are available, to the presence of intolerable side effects to the antiepileptic medication, or a combination of both."
What tests are used to determine if a child is a candidate for epilepsy surgery?,"'As previously mentioned, surgery is only preferred once it is clear that the child is resistant to or does not respond well to antiepileptic medications. Many tests are used to make this determination.''Electroencephalograms (''EEG'') are very important in determining the type of epileptic seizures as well as the area of the brain that is responsible for the seizure disorder. When the routine EEG (usually one hour long) does not give enough information, the child might need to be hospitalized (usually in special EEG wards) for a prolonged EEG with video monitoring. During the hospital admission (which may last several days) the EEG is recorded continuously throughout the entire day. The goal is to record epileptic events for further analysis. In some children it is necessary to stop the antiepileptic medications while the child is in the hospital to facilitate the emergence of an epileptic event. ''Neuroimaging studies are very important to help determine the presence of ''brain lesions''. A ''CT scan'' and an ''MRI'', in some cases, might be helpful to point to the specific area of the brain that is abnormal. These tests are very effective to identify developmental abnormalities, ''brain tumors'', ''scars'' due to prior bleeding events, or the presence of ''vascular malformations'' that might be responsible for the epileptic seizures. ''In some children, functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or ictal SPECT (an SPECT obtained at the time of the epileptic event) might also be indicated in order to determine the area of the brain to be excised.''In some cases the localization of the epileptogenic area requires invasive monitoring. In these children, electrodes that record the brain activity are placed either inside the brain (intracerebral electrodes) or directly on top of the brain (subdural electrodes). This procedure may be done at the time of the surgery or days before, in which case it requires a small operation and admission to the hospital for several days for continuous EEG recording. ''Resective surgery (removing specific areas of brain tissue) may result in functional deficits. The functional deficits relate to the area of the brain involved in the surgery. For example, operations near the motor area might result in motor paralysis; surgery in the posterior area of the brain (the occipital lobe) might result in visual deficiencies. Of particular importance is the surgery that is performed in or near the temporal lobe which, among other functions, is responsible for language comprehension and memory. In such cases a special test, called the WADA test, is performed to ensure that removal of the local lesion does not result in severe memory or language functional deficits.''Once the evaluation is completed the team will decide if the patient is a viable candidate for surgery and in that case, what type of surgery is indicated. ''It is worthwhile to mention that not all of the above-mentioned tests are necessary in all patients. ' "
Who performs pediatric epilepsy surgery?,"'The actual surgery is performed by a neurosurgeon with specialized training and experience in pediatric epilepsy surgery. However, prior to the surgery the patient must be evaluated by a team of epileptologists, neuroradiologists, neuropsychologists, and neurosurgeons with specialized training in patients with refractory epilepsy. Most of these teams are in large academic medical centers with affiliations to medical schools. The team will tailor the surgery for each child on an individual basis.' "
What are the types of epilepsy surgery?,"'The following are the surgical interventions that are performed to control epileptic disorders. These procedures can be done directly on the brain, (resective surgery or corpus callosotomy), or by implanting a stimulator of the vagus nerve in the neck (vagal nerve stimulation). ' In resective surgery the part of the brain that causes the seizures is removed.  In corpus callosotomy   the major connection between the two sides of the brain is severed (cut). Vagus nerve stimulation is a procedure in which a small wire is attached to the vagus nerve in the neck. This wire is used to electrically stimulate the vagus nerve. "
Resective epilepsy surgery,"""Resective surgery is the best indication for those children with epilepsy that is resistant to the antiepileptic medications and in whom a focal area of the brain was identified as the cause of the seizures. Most of these children have focal seizures rather than generalized seizures. In this procedure, the portion of the child's cerebral cortex that is causing seizures is removed. In some children the epileptic area is restricted to one discrete area of the brain, for example the temporal lobe; in other children several areas of the brain might be involved. The type and the extent of the surgery depends upon the size and location of the epileptogenic area. When the lesion is very discrete, a small area of the brain might be removed, a procedure known as partial lobectomy. If the lesion is more extensive, the child might need a bigger resection, known as multilobar resection. In some extreme cases a full half of the brain might need to be removed, known as a hemispherectomy.""'Since resective surgery will result in the elimination of an area of the brain that might still be functioning before the operation is performed, it must be determined that the area in question can be removed without unacceptable problems, such as a loss of language capacity or a severe motor (movement) insufficiency.''In some children resective surgery could be the most effective form of treatment. For example, in children with mesial temporal sclerosis, a condition in which there is a well-localized lesion in the temporal lobe, the resection of the lesion can result in up to 80% of patients being seizure-free. Fifty percent of children with extensive malformations involving one hemisphere may be seizure-free after hemispherectomy. ''In general, for the selective group of children with well-localized lesions, resective surgery will be beneficial in most of them. ' "
Corpus callosotomy,"'The corpus callosum is a structure composed of nerve fibers that allows for communication between both sides of the brain. Corpus callosotomy consist of cutting the corpus callosum. In partial callosotomy, one section of the corpus callosum is cut, whereas in total callosotomy the whole length of the corpus callosum is cut. Since the fibers that go from one half of the brain to the other half are cut, the communication between the two halves of the brain is impaired. This is precisely the goal of the callosotomy. By limiting the communication between the two sides of the brain the callosotomy prevents the rapid spreading of the epileptic event from one half of the brain to the other.''The indication for this operation is rather limited, mostly to children who have frequent drop attacks, and at the present time is not frequently performed.' "
Vagus nerve stimulator (VNS),"'The vagus nerve is a nerve that connects the brain with several internal organs such as the ''lungs'', heart, stomach, and other organs. Stimulation of the vagus nerve sends information to the brain. Studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve results in an inhibition of seizure activity. However, the reasons for this improvement are not clear.''The vagus nerve stimulator (''VNS'') is a device that consists of a wire attached to an electrical stimulator. The wire is wrapped around the left vagus nerve in the neck, and the electrical stimulator is implanted in a pouch under the skin in the upper chest. The stimulator is programmed to send electrical signals continuously. The strength and the frequency of the electrical stimulation is adjusted as needed by professionals with special training in this technique. Additionally, the system has a magnetic hand-held device that can be used by the patient. Patients who can recognize the beginning of their seizures, for example those who have auras, can use this device to activate the system and abort the seizure. Also, since the stimulator can be activated at any time, if needed, it could be useful to shorten long-lasting seizures and also in the ''prevention'' of status epilepticus.''VNS seems to be effective in a variety of ''seizure disorders'' and epileptic syndromes. It has also proven to be effective in epileptic disorders that are resistant to antiepileptic treatment. Studies show that in many individuals with refractory seizures, VNS significantly reduced seizure activity, and some people have been rendered seizure-free.''VNS is indicated in children with epileptic disorders resistant to medication that are not candidates for surgery.''In the USA, VNS is approved for children older than 12 years of age; however, there is no age limit in the European Union. ''Potential side effects of VNS implantation are those from general anesthesia, the failure of the implant to work and infection at the implant site. Additionally, stimulation of the vagus nerve may cause ''hoarseness'', ''coughing'', and may even change the heart rate. Because the VNS is implanted outside the skull, there is little possibility of additional neurological damage.' "
What are the risks of epilepsy surgery?,"'Some of the risks associated with epilepsy surgery are related to the presurgical evaluation. Some of the tests performed require the use of contrast material that might result in severe ''allergic'' reactions. Implanting electrodes in the brain or placing electrodes on the surface of the brain for continuous monitoring requires surgical procedures that are not very complicated but may be associated with bleeding or infections.''Many tests, as well as the different surgical procedures, require the use of heavy sedation or general anesthesia. General anesthesia has a very small risk of death. ''There are several risks inherent to the surgery, for example, bleeding inside the brain. Bleeding inside the brain might result in additional brain damage, besides; the accumulation of blood might increase the pressure inside the cranium resulting in severe complications, including death. Also the operation may be complicated by infections that can result in meningitis. A later complication of these events could be the development of ''hydrocephalus'', which may require another surgical procedure.''As described before, resective surgery implies the removal of a piece of the brain that in some instances could be as much as the whole hemisphere. This resective surgery may aggravate prior functional deficits or may result in new ones. These complications may occur even after very careful evaluation. ''The range of complications varies with the extent of the surgery and the area removed. For example:''In the particular case of the callosotomy, since there is some degree of disconnection between the right and the left side of the brain, besides the complications already mentioned, some annoying subtle deficiencies may be experienced. For example, some patients may be able to identify, by visual recognition, objects presented to one side of the brain, but might not be able to name them because the memory of the name is in the other side of the brain. In general there are fewer complications with callosotomies than with resective surgery.''Yet, as in the case with all surgeries, there is always the risk of failure. In the case of epilepsy surgery this means recurrence of the epileptic seizures after the operation. Depending upon the type of pre-existing lesion, the failure rate may be as high as 50%. However, even in these cases, the seizures may be easily controlled with medications after the surgery.''In general there are very few complications observed after surgery. A small percentage of children who have had epilepsy surgery experience complications, and even fewer have neurological complications. Mortality (death) is very rare.''As previously mentioned, there is plasticity in the brain of young children, mostly up to the age of 7 to 9 years. The plasticity helps in the recovery of deficits that can be the result of surgery. For example, for children in whom the language areas were affected by the surgery there is remarkable recovery of language functions. Therefore, young children with intractable seizures who are candidates for surgery are much better off when the surgery is done sooner than later. ''Previous contributing medical author: Harley I. Kornblum, MD, PhD'  operations near the motor areas might result in paralysis or weakness in the arms or legs, or loss of fine motor coordination in the hands;  operations near the language areas might result in language disorders;  operations near the cortical visual areas might result in visual deficits."
What is antibiotic resistance?,"'Antibiotics are medications used to kill or slow the growth of bacteria and some fungi. Antibiotics are not effective in treating infections caused by ''viruses''.''The definition of antibiotic resistance is the adaptive change in bacteria (mutation) that allows them to grow in the presence of a drug (an antibiotic) that would normally slow their growth or kill them. These antibiotic resistant bacteria and fungi become harder to treat, causing increased morbidity.''CDC (Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'') statistics show there are approximately 2 million antibiotic resistant infections each year in the United States. According to the WHO (World Health Organization), antibiotic resistant infections can lead to longer hospital stays, higher treatment costs, and more deaths.' "
What are some types of antibiotic resistance?," Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria: commonly seen in hospitals and healthcare settings (hospital acquired or HA-MRSA), but also in among people in close contact such as athletes (community associated or CA-MRSA). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) bacteria are resistant to vancomycin, an antibiotic often used as a last resort Certain microbes are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics:Food-borne bacteria responsible for food poisoning such as E. coli, Salmonella, and CampylobacterSexually transmitted bacteria that cause gonorrheaPenicillin-resistant Streptococci that cause pneumoniaTuberculosisInfluenzaHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)Malaria Food-borne bacteria responsible for food poisoning such as E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter Sexually transmitted bacteria that cause gonorrhea Penicillin-resistant Streptococci that cause pneumonia Tuberculosis Influenza Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Malaria"
What causes antibiotic resistance?,"'Bacteria, viruses are living organisms that can change over time. They reproduce and spread quickly and efficiently, and can adapt to their environments and change in ways to ensure their survival. When confronted with an antibiotic that may hinder their ability to reproduce, genetic changes (mutations) can occur that enable the microbe to survive. This evolution can happen in a number of ways:' Selective Pressure: In the presence of an antibiotic, microbes that carry resistance genes can survive and replicate. Mutation: Most microbes reproduce by dividing every few hours and mutations may occur that can help microbes survive exposure to antibiotics. Gene Transfer: Microbes can get genes from each other that make the microbe drug resistant. Societal Pressures: The widespread use of antibiotics in different spheres of society, sometimes when they're unnecessary, creates selective pressure that allows resistant organisms to be produced.Inappropriate Use: Inappropriate use of antibiotics can occur, such as when a healthcare provider will prescribe an antibiotic because an insistent patient has demanded it, even without a diagnosis.Inadequate Diagnostics: Sometimes broad-spectrum antibiotics are used even when a specific antibiotic might be better because there is incomplete or imperfect information to diagnose an infection. This contributes to selective pressure.Hospital Use: Critically ill patients are more susceptible to infections and they frequently need antibiotics, but this increased use along with close contact among sick patients creates an environment where antimicrobial-resistant germs can spread easily.Agricultural Use: Adding antibiotics to agricultural feed can promote drug resistance. Inappropriate Use: Inappropriate use of antibiotics can occur, such as when a healthcare provider will prescribe an antibiotic because an insistent patient has demanded it, even without a diagnosis. Inadequate Diagnostics: Sometimes broad-spectrum antibiotics are used even when a specific antibiotic might be better because there is incomplete or imperfect information to diagnose an infection. This contributes to selective pressure. Hospital Use: Critically ill patients are more susceptible to infections and they frequently need antibiotics, but this increased use along with close contact among sick patients creates an environment where antimicrobial-resistant germs can spread easily. Agricultural Use: Adding antibiotics to agricultural feed can promote drug resistance."
How are antibiotic-resistant infections diagnosed?,"'Tests may be used to determine which microbe is causing an infection and to which antibiotics the microbe might be resistant (called a “culture and sensitivity”). But often, diagnostic tests can take days to weeks to get results because many of tests require the microbe to grow over a period of time before it can be identified.''Samples may be taken of blood, urine, ''stool'', sputum, tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or ''mucus'' from the nose, throat, or genitals. Samples may then be stained and examined under a microscope, cultured (allowed to grow), or tested for antibodies, antigens, or genetic material (such as DNA or RNA) from the microorganism to determine the organism responsible for the infection.''In many cases treatment decisions are needed before test results are known and healthcare providers may prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics when a more specific treatment might be better.' "
What is the treatment for antibiotic-resistant infections?,"'A doctor will decide when to use antibiotics, and what ''drugs'' should be used. Antibiotics are used to fight ''bacterial infections'' and sometimes, ''fungal infections''. Antibiotics are not intended for use against viral infections. They are ineffective and may contribute to the development antibiotic-resistant bacteria.''If you have a bacterial infection that is resistant to a particular antibiotic, a doctor can prescribe a different, more appropriate, antibiotic that is more effective against that organism.' "
Can antibiotic resistance be prevented?,"'To prevent antibiotic resistance, follow all instructions from your doctor on taking prescription medications. Complete the entire course of the antibiotics as directed, even if you feel better before you finish them. Never share your medications with others or take medicine prescribed for another person.''The less often you get sick, the less often you might need to take antibiotics. The less often you take antibiotics, the less likely your infections are to develop antibiotic resistance. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle including proper ''nutrition'', regular ''exercise'', and getting adequate ''sleep'' can help your immune system stay healthy.''In addition, practice good hygiene such as washing hands frequently to prevent the spread of illness.' "
What is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)?,"'The ''respiratory syncytial virus'' (RSV), discovered in 1956, is capable of causing a broad spectrum of illnesses. Older children and adults will commonly experience a ""bad ''cold''"" lasting one to two weeks. ''Fever'', nasal ''congestion'', and ''cough'' are their most common complaints. However, in ''babies'' and toddlers, RSV can produce severe pulmonary diseases, including ''bronchiolitis'' (inflammation of the terminal airways that produces wheezing) and ''pneumonia'' (infection of these terminal airways).' "
"When does RSV infection occur, and who gets it?","'Infection with RSV is seasonal. In temperate climates, RSV infections usually occur during the late fall, winter, or early spring months.''More than half of all infants are exposed to RSV by their first birthday. Many have few or mild symptoms. However, some babies with RSV become very ill. RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and ''pneumonia'' among infants and children under 1 year of age.''Since an initial RSV infection does not trigger a robust long-term immune system response, after childhood, RSV may cause repeated infections throughout life.' Annual community outbreaks of RSV infection often last four to five months. The winter season (November through April) tend to be most likely to experience RSV epidemic disease. For unknown reasons, severity of illness and frequency of disease often alternate on an annual basis. For example: a ""bad"" year (large number of patients with moderately severe disease) is followed by a ""good"" year (fewer number of patients with less severe disease). These infections are usually associated with cold-like symptoms. However, severe lower respiratory tract disease (for example, wheezing and/or pneumonia) may occur at any age, especially among the elderly or among those with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems. An RSV infection may exacerbate conditions such as asthma, COPD, and congestive heart failure."
Who is at risk for severe disease?,"'Several broad categories of patients are most vulnerable to RSV infection. These include:' premature infants and all infants less than 1 year of age, children 2 years old with cardiac disease or chronic lung disease (for example, asthma, cystic fibrosis, etc.), those of any age with a compromised immune system, and those 65 years of age or older."
"Is RSV infection contagious, and how does RSV infection spread?","'RSV disease is highly contagious. Annually 100,000-120,000 babies less than 1 year old require hospitalization.' The RSV incubation period (time between exposure and development of symptoms) is two to eight days. It spreads via respiratory secretions through close contact with infected people or contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. Infection can occur when infectious particles contacts mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth, or nose, and possibly through the inhalation of droplets generated by a sneeze or cough. Those who develop RSV are contagious during the first three to eight days of their illness. RSV can live for many hours on common household objects such as furniture and tabletops. As such, disease transmission may be indirect by hand to mouth after touching such contaminated surfaces. This mode of transmission is especially common between infants and toddlers."
What are the symptoms of RSV infection?,"'Following childhood, RSV may cause repeated infections with moderate-to-severe ''cold-like symptoms'' although severe lower respiratory tract disease (pneumonia and/or wheezing) may occur with RSV at any age.'   The symptoms in most infants are similar to those of a bad cold. These include fever, prominent runny nose, cough, and nasal congestion. The duration of these symptoms is one to two weeks. During their first RSV infection, some babies and young children also have signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Bronchiolitis is a clinical state of infants (by definition) during which inflammation of the terminal airways restricts airflow and may produce wheezing. The majority of children hospitalized for RSV infection are under 6 months of age. The need for supplemental oxygen, IV fluids, and pulmonary inhalation therapy are the most common indicators for hospitalization.If wheezing causes an infant's respiratory rate to increase substantially, they may have a difficult time taking in adequate fluids and become dehydrated. If wheezing causes an infant's respiratory rate to increase substantially, they may have a difficult time taking in adequate fluids and become dehydrated."
How do health care professionals diagnose RSV infection?,"'Health care professionals make a diagnosis of RSV infection using a number of different laboratory tests, including''Most clinical laboratories today use nasal swab tests based on antigen detection to diagnose RSV infection. This technique is 80%-90% reliable. A newer test protocol (RT-''PCR'') is more reliable and is replacing the antigen-detecting test in many hospitals and community laboratories.' isolation of the virus, detection of viral antigens, detection of viral RNA, demonstration of a rise in serum antibodies, or a combination of these approaches."
What is the treatment for an RSV infection?,"'For children with mild RSV disease, no specific treatment is necessary other than the treatment of symptoms (such as ''acetaminophen'' [''Tylenol''] to reduce fever). RSV infection is a viral illness and antibiotic therapy will not be helpful.''Children with more severe disease may require supplemental oxygen and sometimes mechanical ventilation (respiratory support via a ''breathing'' machine). Health care providers may use ''ribavirin'' aerosol (Virazole) in the treatment of some hospitalized patients with severe disease. Some investigators have used a combination of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) with high titers of neutralizing RSV antibody (RSV-IVIG) and ribavirin to treat patients with compromised immune systems.''The American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' has recently published guidelines for children from one month of age through 23 months of age dealing with bronchiolitis (most commonly caused by RVS). Previous recommendations were updated and recommend against nebulizer (inhalation) therapy employing ''albuterol'', steroids, or hypertonic (highly concentrated) saline.'  "
Is it possible to prevent RSV infection?,"'Frequent hand washing and not sharing items such as cups, glasses, and utensils with people who have RSV illness should decrease the spread of virus to others.''Excluding children with colds or other respiratory illnesses (without fever) who are well enough to attend child care or school settings will probably ''not'' decrease the transmission of RSV, since it is often spread in the early stages of illness prior to the development of more severe symptoms.''In a hospital setting, RSV transmission can and should be prevented by strict attention to contact precautions, such as hand washing and wearing gowns, facemasks, and gloves.''In 1998, a new product called palivizumab (Synagis) was licensed to help prevent severe RSV disease in certain high-risk infants with predisposing factors such as moderate/severe prematurity, chronic lung disease, congenital ''heart disease'', etc. Palivizumab is not a treatment for RSV but rather a tool to help prevent RSV infection. Those receiving Synagis receive a monthly injection during the RSV season. Synagis is quite expensive, and insurance companies often have strict guidelines limiting those for whom they will pay this medication.' "
Is there an RSV vaccine?,"'Unfortunately, there is no RSV ''vaccine'' yet, although development of one is a high research priority.'""Effective immunity against RSV requires a continuous solid level of antibodies against the virus. There is particular concern for RSV in premature babies because of their lack of maturity and lack of protective antibodies. There is a similar concern about RSV in people of all ages with immunodeficiency. Most people's immune system loses its protective capability a few months following exposure to RSV. This enables individuals to experience repeated episodes of illness during each RSV season."" "
What is the prognosis of an RSV infection?,"'Most babies and toddlers tolerate an RSV infection well. Unless they require supplemental oxygen or are at risk for ''dehydration'', they can receive any necessary respiratory support from their parents in their home. Unfortunately, no current vaccination is available to prevent RSV infection. Hopefully, current research in this area will soon be successful.' "
Is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) contagious?,"'Respiratory syncytial virus'' (RSV) is ''contagious'"". In the United States, it's the most common cause of inflammation of the small airways in the ""'lungs'' (bronchiolitis) and of ''pneumonia'' in children under 1 year of age. It also is significant cause of respiratory illnesses in older adults. Nearly all children in the U.S. will have been infected by RSV by 2 years of age. RSV usually causes a mild respiratory infection, but it can occasionally cause more serious infections that require hospitalization from ''breathing'' compromise with bronchiolitis or ''pneumonia''. RSV was discovered in 1956 (isolated from a chimpanzee but later found to be from human origins) and was designated chimpanzee coryza agent by J. Morris and associates. Years later, the ''viruses'' were renamed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In virology terminology, RSV is an enveloped RNA virus and is a member of the family ''Paramyxoviridae'' that infects lung tissue.' "
"What is the incubation period for a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 
infection?","'Most infants and children and older adults usually develop symptoms about 4 to 6 days after their first exposure to RSV. This is referred to as the incubation period. Symptoms of RSV include a ''runny nose'' and ''decreased appetite'' followed by ''coughing'', ''sneezing'', no ''fever'' or a mild ''fever'' at 1 to 3 days. Most individuals with RSV who are otherwise healthy do not require hospitalization. However, some very young infants and others may develop more serious symptoms of ''wheezing'', irritability, decreased activity, ''cyanosis'' (blue-gray color to skin) and breathing difficulties. Some of these individuals may require short (3 to 5 days) hospital stays. Even more severe infections can require supported breathing. Definitive diagnosis can be done by viral cultures, detecting RSV antigens, ''PCR'' assays, and molecular probes (molecules used to detect other molecules or structures).' "
What is the contagious period for RSV?,"'The symptoms described in the previous section usually last approximately 1 week during which symptoms gradually disappear. Individuals are usually no longer contagious after the symptoms disappear (5 to 8 days). However, individuals with weakened immune systems can be contagious for as long as 4 weeks.' "
How does respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) spread?,"'RSV is spread person to person. ''Coughs'' and/or sneezes distribute droplets filled with the RSV microbes into the air. If uninfected individuals have the droplets contact their mouth, nose, or eyes, or inhale them, they may become infected with RSV. Infections can also occur from direct person-to-person contact such as kissing the face of an infected child. In this way, RSV can be transferred from infants to adults and from infants to ''pregnant'' adults. In addition, indirect contact with RSV-infected droplets that have landed on surfaces that can be touched, such as doorknobs, eating utensils, or toys, can also become sources that transfer the infection. RSV can survive for many hours on hard surfaces.' "
When should I seek medical care for anyone with RSV infection?,"'Most children and some adults who develop RSV infections do not need to seek medical care. Individuals with premature infants, young children with chronic heart or lung conditions, and children or adults with weakened immune systems should seek medical care immediately if infection with RSV is suspected. While there is no commercially available RSV vaccine, there is a drug called palivizumab (''Synagis'"") that may be used in certain infants and children who are at high risk for developing severe RSV infection. Unfortunately, this drug cannot help or cure children already suffering from serious RSV disease and cannot prevent infection with RSV. The drug's function, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, is to reduce the severity of RSV in children (mainly under 1 year of age) with underlying problems such as congenital ""'heart disease'', chronic lung disease, or other debilitating conditions.'  "
What is restless leg syndrome (RLS)?,"'Restless leg syndrome (''RLS'', ''restless legs syndrome'') is a common cause of painful legs. The leg ''pain'' of restless leg syndrome typically eases with motion of the legs and becomes more noticeable at rest. Restless leg syndrome also features worsening of symptoms and leg pain during the early evening or later at night.''Restless leg syndrome is often abbreviated ''RLS''; it has also been termed shaking leg syndrome. Nighttime involuntary jerking of the legs during ''sleep'' are also known as periodic leg/limb movement disorder.'  "
What are the common signs and symptoms of restless leg syndrome?,"'Many different symptoms are described by people with restless leg syndrome, for example:''The characteristic nighttime worsening of symptoms in persons with restless legs syndrome frequency leads to ''insomnia''.

How do you know if you have restless leg syndrome?,"'The National Institutes of Health says that four criteria must be met for the diagnosis of RLS in a person (adult or child):' A strong urge to move your legs. This urge often, but not always, occurs with unpleasant feelings in your legs. When the disorder is severe, you also may have the urge to move your arms. Symptoms that start or get worse when you're inactive. The urge to move increases when you're sitting still or lying down and resting. Relief from moving. Movement, especially walking, helps relieve the unpleasant feelings. Symptoms that start or get worse in the evening or at night."
What is the treatment for restless leg syndrome? Is there a cure?,"'Treatment of restless leg syndrome is first directed toward any underlying illness, if known. For example:''There is no cure for restless leg syndrome; however, the condition usually responds well to home remedies and medications. The outlook is excellent for people with restless leg syndrome as long as it does not weaken or damage the function of the legs.'   Blood testing to reveal underlying iron deficiency anemia may reveal the underlying cause. If varicose veins are thought to be the cause, then surgery to repair the circulation may be considered. Reduction or elimination of caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol from a person's diet can be very helpful. Stopping smoking can significantly diminish or prevent symptoms. Getting better sleep and exercise can help some persons affected by restless legs. Pregnant women who do not sleep well at night and other people with sleep disorders may develop RLS."
What medications treat restless leg syndrome and its symptoms?,"'Medications used to treat restless leg syndrome include:' natural supplements (such as iron), carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet), opioids (such as hydrocodone, or tramadol [Ultram] for intermittent symptoms), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Tegretol XR, Equetro, Carbatrol), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), triazolam (Halcion), temazepam (Restoril), baclofen (Lioresal) bromocriptine, clonidine (Catapres, Catapres-TTS, Jenloga), gabapentin (Neurontin), gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant ER), ropinirole (Requip), and pramipexole (Mirapex)."

Can other conditions mimic restless leg syndrome?,"'There are many conditions which can mimic restless leg syndrome including:''In children, restless leg syndrome is often misdiagnosed as ""growing pains.""' Parkinson's disease, fibromyalgia, muscle diseases, joint conditions, nerve problems such as peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), and circulation difficulties."
What is the retina?,"'The retina is an extremely thin tissue that lines the inside of the back of the eye. It is the light-sensitive portion of the eye. When we look around, light from the objects we are looking at enters the eye. The light image is focused onto the retina by both the ''cornea'' and the ''lens''. This light striking the retina causes a complex biochemical change within certain layers of the retina and this, in turn, stimulates an electrical response within other layers of the retina. Nerve endings within the retina then transmit these electrical signals to the brain through the ''optic nerve'', which connects the eye to the brain. Within specific areas of the brain, this electrical energy is received and processed to allow us both to see and to understand what we are seeing. The retina has been compared to the film of a camera. However, once used, film has a permanent image on it. The neurosensory retina, in contrast, continually renews itself chemically and electrically, allowing us to see millions of different images every day without them being superimposed.''The retina is about the size of a postage stamp. It consists of a central area called the macula and a much larger peripheral area of the retina. The light receptor cells within the retina are of two types called the cones and the rods. Cones are concentrated within the macular (central) area and provide us with the sharpness of ''central vision'' and color vision. Rods predominate in the peripheral area of the retina and allow us to see in conditions of reduced illumination. The peripheral retina allows us to see objects on either side (peripheral vision) and, therefore, provides the vision needed for a person to move about safely. Since this part of the retina contains a lesser concentration of cones, it does not allow for appreciation of visual detail. Its larger concentration of rods provides better vision during conditions of darkness.''The macula, the smaller central area of the retina containing a high concentration of cones, enables clear central vision to see fine details for such activities as seeing small objects at a distance, reading, or threading a needle. The macula is particularly sensitive to circulatory changes, especially those that occur with ''aging'', such as decreased blood flow. The retina contains a network of branching arteries, which supplies blood that carries the needed oxygen and nutrients to the retina, and a network of accompanying veins, which then carry the blood away together with the waste products generated by the retina as it does its seeing work.' "
What is a retinal detachment?,"'A retinal detachment is an eye condition involving separation of the retina from its attachments to the underlying tissue within the eye. Most retinal detachments are a result of a retinal break, hole, or tear. A retinal detachment of this type is known as a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Most retinal breaks, holes, or tears are not a result of injury. The majority of retinal breaks, holes, or tears are spontaneous, result when the vitreous gel pulls loose or separates from its attachment to the retina, usually in the peripheral parts of the retina. The vitreous is a clear gel that fills two-thirds of the inside of the eye and occupies the space in front of the retina. As the vitreous gel pulls loose, it will sometimes exert pulling forces, known as traction, on the retina, and if the retina is weak, the retina will tear. Retinal tears are sometimes accompanied by bleeding if a retinal blood vessel is included in the tear. Everyone develops some shrinkage of the vitreous as they age, and many people develop separation of the vitreous from the retina as they get older. However, only a small percentage of these vitreous separations result in retinal tears.''Once the retina has torn, liquid from the vitreous gel can then pass through the tear and accumulate behind the retina. The buildup of fluid behind the retina is what separates (detaches) the retina from underlying layers in the back of the eye. As more of the liquid vitreous collects behind the retina, the extent of the retinal detachment can increase and involve the entire retina, leading to a total retinal detachment. A retinal detachment almost always affects only one eye at a time. The second eye, however, must be checked thoroughly for any signs of predisposing factors or existing retinal tears or holes that may lead to a retinal detachment in the future.'  "
What are retinal detachment symptoms and signs?,"'Flashing lights (photopsias) and ''floaters'"" (floating spots in the vision) may be the initial symptoms of a retinal detachment or of a retinal tear that precedes the detachment itself. Anyone who is beginning to experience these symptoms should see an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) for a retinal examination. In this exam, drops are used to dilate the patient's pupils to make a more detailed exam easier. The symptoms of flashing lights and floaters may often be unassociated with a tear or detachment and can merely result from a separation of the vitreous gel from the retina. This condition is called a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). Although a PVD occurs commonly, in the majority of cases, there are no tears associated with the condition.""'The flashing lights are caused by the vitreous gel pulling on the retina or a looseness of the vitreous, which allows the vitreous gel to bump against the retina. The lights are often described as resembling brief lightning streaks in the outside edges (periphery) of the eye. The floaters are caused by condensations (small solidifications) in the vitreous gel and frequently are described by patients as spots, strands, or little flies. Some people even want to use a flyswatter to eliminate these pesky floaters. There is no safe treatment to make the floaters disappear. Most people with complaints of floaters do not have tears of the retina or a retinal detachment.''If the patient experiences a shadow or curtain that affects any part of the vision of either eye, this can indicate that a retinal tear has progressed to a detached retina. In this situation, one should immediately consult an eye doctor since time can be critical. The goal for the ophthalmologist is to promptly make the diagnosis and treat the retinal tear or detachment before the central macular area of the retina detaches.'  "
What are retinal detachment causes and risk factors?,"'Studies have shown that the incidence of retinal detachments caused by tears in the retina is fairly low, affecting approximately one in 10,000 people each year. Many retinal tears do not progress to retinal detachment. Nevertheless, many risk factors for developing retinal detachments are recognized, including certain diseases of the eyes (discussed below), ''cataract surgery'', and trauma to the eye. Retinal detachments can occur at any age but are most common in adults 40 years old and older who are highly nearsighted (myopic) and also in older people who have undergone ''cataract'' surgery.' "
Which diseases of the eyes predispose to the development of a retinal detachment?,"   Lattice degeneration of the retina is a type of thinning of the outside edges of the retina, which occurs in 7%-10% of the general population. The lattice degeneration, so-called because the thinned retina resembles the crisscross pattern of a lattice, often contains small holes. Lattice degeneration is more common in people with nearsightedness (myopia). This tendency to lattice degeneration occurs because myopic eyes are larger than normal eyes and, therefore, the peripheral retina is stretched more thinly. Fortunately, only about 1% of patients with lattice degeneration go on to develop a retinal detachment. All patients with lattice degeneration of the retina should be informed about this condition and cautioned about the importance of seeing an ophthalmologist immediately if they develop sudden floaters, flashes, or a cloud in their vision. High myopia (greater than 5 or 6 diopters of nearsightedness) increases the risk of a retinal detachment. In fact, the risk increases to 2.4% as compared to a 0.06% risk for a normal eye at 60 years of age. (Diopters are units of measurement that indicate the power of the lens to focus rays of light.) Cataract surgery or other operations of the eye can further increase this risk in those with high myopia. People taking certain kinds of eyedrops have an increased risk of developing a retinal detachment. Pilocarpine, which for many years was a mainstay of therapy for glaucoma, has long been associated with retinal detachment. Moreover, by constricting the pupil, pilocarpine makes the diagnostic exam of the peripheral retina more difficult, possibly leading to a delay in the diagnosis. Individuals with chronic inflammation of the eye (uveitis) are at increased risk of developing retinal detachment."
How does cataract surgery lead to a retinal detachment?,"'Cataract surgery, especially, if the operation has complications involving the vitreous, increases the risk of a retinal detachment. ''Cataracts'' are a clouding (opacity) within the lens of the eye. Although cataract surgery does increase the chance of retinal detachment, the risk is low, that is less than 2% over 20 years; and the benefits of cataract surgery ordinarily far outweigh the risk of retinal detachment.' "
What other factors are associated with a retinal detachment?," Blunt trauma, as from a tennis ball or fist, or a penetrating injury by a sharp object to the eye can lead to a retinal detachment. A family history of a detached retina that is non-traumatic in nature seems to indicate a genetic (inherited) tendency for developing retinal detachments. In a few patients with a non-traumatic retinal detachment of one eye, a detachment subsequently occurs in the other eye. Accordingly, the second eye of a patient with a retinal detachment must be examined thoroughly and followed closely, both by the patient and the ophthalmologist. Diabetes that has been complicated by the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy can lead to a type of retinal detachment that is caused by pulling on the retina (traction) alone, without a tear. Because of abnormal blood vessels and scar tissue on the retinal surface in some people with diabetic proliferative retinopathy, the retina can be lifted off (detached) from the back of the eye. In addition, the blood vessels may bleed into the vitreous gel. This detachment may involve either the peripheral or central area of the retina. Non-rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are those that are not a result of a retinal break, hole, or tear. These include conditions known as exudative retinal detachments and tractional retinal detachments."
Why is it mandatory to treat a retinal detachment?,"'A tear or hole of the retina that leads to a peripheral retinal detachment causes the loss of side (peripheral) vision. Almost all of those affected will progress to a full retinal detachment and loss of all vision if the problem is not repaired. The dark shadow or curtain obscuring a portion of the vision, either from the side, above, or below, almost invariably will advance to the loss of all useful vision. Spontaneous reattachment of the retina is rare.''Early diagnosis and repair are critical since visual improvement is much greater when the retina is repaired before the macula or central area is detached. The surgical repair of a retinal detachment is usually successful in reattaching the retina, although more than one procedure may be necessary. Once the retina is reattached, vision usually improves and then stabilizes. Successful reattachment does not always result in normal vision. The ability to read after successful surgery will depend on whether or not the macula (central part of the retina) was detached, the extent of time that it was detached and whether any ''scar'' tissue developed related to the detachment or the surgery.' "
What types of doctors treat retinal detachment?,"'Ophthalmologists treat retinal detachments. An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who chose to specialize in diseases and surgery of the eye. Although all ophthalmologists are trained in the diagnosis of retinal detachment, most surgery for retinal detachment is performed by ophthalmologists who have chosen to sub-specialize in vitreoretinal surgery.' "
What is the treatment for retinal detachment?,"'Retinal holes or tears can be treated with laser therapy, known as photocoagulation, or ''cryotherapy'' (freezing the retina or cryopexy) to prevent their progression to a retinal detachment. Not all holes require treatment, and many factors determine which holes or tears need treatment. These factors include the type and location of the holes, whether pulling on the retina (traction) or bleeding is involved, and the presence of any of the other risk factors discussed above.''Physicians perform three types of eye surgery for actual retinal detachment: vitrectomy, scleral buckling, and pneumatic retinopexy. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV or vitrectomy involving removal of the vitreous gel of the eye) is the most common surgery performed for a retinal detachment today. For many years, scleral buckling was the standard treatment for detached retinas. It involves sewing a piece of ''plastic'' into the wall of the eye, and physicians still use it in many cases today, sometimes in combination with pars plana vitrectomy. Both pars plana vitrectomy and scleral buckling are surgeries that doctors perform in a hospital or freestanding surgical center under general or local anesthesia. An overnight stay is sometimes necessary post-operatively. In many cases, intra-ocular ''gas'' will be placed into the vitreous at the end of the surgery. This gas pushes against the retina to keep it attached while healing occurs. The gas absorbs over a period of days to weeks, and the patient may be told to position the head in a specific way during this period to maximize the effect of the gas. Certain complicated or severe retinal detachments may require a more complex operation, including membrane removal and excision of scar tissue. These detachments include those caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels on the retina or in the vitreous, as occurs in advanced ''diabetes'' and recurrent detachments with membrane formation, known as proliferative vitreo-retinopathy (PVR). In these complicated cases, an eye doctor places silicone oil in the vitreous ''cavity'' instead of a gas. This oil is permanent and usually requires surgical removal later.'  "
"What are complications of surgery for a retinal detachment, and what is recovery like after retinal detachment surgery?","'Discomfort, watering, redness, swelling, and ''itching'' of the affected eye are all common and may persist for some time after the operation. These symptoms are usually treated with eyedrops. ''Blurred vision'' may last for many months, and new glasses may need to be prescribed, because the scleral buckle changes the shape of the eye. The scleral buckle also can cause ''double vision'' (''diplopia'') by affecting one of the muscles that controls the movements of the eye. Other possible complications are elevated pressure in the eye (''glaucoma''), bleeding into the vitreous -- within the retina -- or behind the retina, clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract), or drooping of the ''eyelid'' (''ptosis''). Additionally, infection can occur around the scleral buckle or even more seriously within the eye (endophthalmitis). Occasionally, the buckle may need to be removed.'  "
What are the results of surgery for a retinal detachment?,"'The surgical repair of retinal detachments is successful in about 85% of patients with a single vitrectomy or scleral buckle procedure. With additional surgery, over 95% of retinas are reattached successfully. Several months may pass, however, before vision returns to its final level. The final outcome for vision depends on several factors. For example, if the macula was detached, central vision rarely will return to normal due to degenerative changes in the macula. The visual changes in this situation are similar to those seen with the much more common condition known as ''macular degeneration'' (''age-related macular degeneration'' or ARMD). Even if the macula was not detached, some vision may still be lost, although most will be regained. New holes, tears, or pulling may develop, leading to new retinal detachments. There may be scarring due to subretinal fibrosis (development of scar tissue beneath the retina). If a gas or air bubble was inserted in the eye during surgery, maintaining proper positioning of the head is also important in determining the final outcome. Pars plana vitrectomy and the use of ''intraocular'' gas in phakic eyes (eyes containing the natural lens) is associated with high subsequent incidence of cataract. Close follow-up by an ophthalmologist, therefore, is required and visits will include slit lamp examination and dilated examination of the retina and vitreous. Because of increased risk of retinal detachment in the other eye, dilated examination of the non-operated eye will also be performed. Long-term studies have shown that even after preventive treatment of a retinal hole or tear, 5%-14% of patients may develop new breaks in the retina, which could lead to a retinal detachment. Overall, however, repair of retinal detachments has made great strides in the past 20 years with the restoration of useful vision to many thousands of people.' "
What is retinitis pigmentosa?,"'Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) represents a group of hereditary progressive retinal disorders. It affects approximately 1.5 million people worldwide. Retinitis pigmentosa usually affects both eyes symmetrically, although in some cases, it affects one eye more than the other. There are several forms of retinitis pigmentosa with different inheritance patterns, clinical signs, and visual symptoms. Common to all of them is progressive degeneration of the retina, specifically of the light-sensitive (photoreceptor) cells known as the rod and cone photoreceptors. The rods, which are largely responsible for night vision, are involved earlier in the course of the disease. RP affects cones, which are responsible for color and ''central vision'', later. Rod-cone dystrophy and progressive pigmentary retinopathy are other names for RP.'""Difficulty with night vision, slow adaptation to the dark, and gradual loss of peripheral vision are typically the first symptoms. People usually retain central visual acuity is until late in the disease. Doctors commonly diagnose RP during adolescence, though symptoms may begin at any age. One uncommon form of RP called Leber's congenital amaurosis occurs with severe ""'vision loss'' at birth. Other late-onset forms of RP generally carry a better prognosis.' "
What causes retinitis pigmentosa?,"'So far, researchers have located over 100 genes associated with RP. However, in about half of RP patients, they have yet to identify the abnormal genes. What these genes all have in common is they are in some way involved in the proper structure and function of the retinal photoreceptor cells, so any abnormalities in these genes will affect retinal health. The most common genetic abnormalities are related to the formation of rhodopsin, a key component of rod photoreceptor cell function. There are various inheritance patterns; researchers have identified X-linked, autosomal recessive, and autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa types. In many cases, there is no known family history of RP.''While most forms of RP only affect the eyes (non-syndromic RP), several forms of RP occur with systemic conditions. For example, retinitis pigmentosa and neural ''hearing loss'' characterize ''Usher syndrome''. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) affects multiple organs; in addition to RP, patients have ''obesity'', abnormalities of fingers and/or toes, small external genitalia in males, kidney anomalies, impaired sense of smell, dental abnormalities, vertebral abnormalities, and in some cases, behavioral and intellectual disability. Another example of an RP syndrome is abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome), characterized by misshapen ''red blood cells'', progressive inability to coordinate movement, and malabsorption of fat in the ''digestive system''. Although rare, this condition is important to recognize early, as specific dietary restrictions can treat it.' "
What are retinitis pigmentosa symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms come on gradually. At first, there is increasing difficulty with night vision (night ''blindness'') or trouble adjusting to dim light after being exposed to bright light. As the rod photoreceptors in the retina continue to degenerate, peripheral vision is affected. Slowly progressive constriction of the visual field ultimately leads to ''tunnel vision''. A small area of ''central vision'' in both eyes usually persists for years. The degree of total ''vision loss'' is variable, with some patients retaining good visual acuity and others losing substantial vision. People first notice the symptoms between 10-40 years of age, although they can appear earlier or later. Generally, autosomal recessive and X-linked forms appear earlier in life.''Some forms of RP affect parts of the eye other than the photoreceptor cells. For example, fluid may accumulate in the macula, which is the center part of the retina. This condition is called cystoid macular ''edema'"" (CME). The eyes' lenses may also cloud, becoming ""'cataracts''. Both CME and ''cataracts'' cause blurred or distorted central vision, and both are treatable.''There are no major outward signs of RP, however, many forms of RP do show signs inside the eyes that an eye doctor can see during a dilated eye exam. These include narrowed retinal arterioles, a waxy appearance of the ''optic nerve'', and characteristic bone-spicule clumping of retinal pigment. However, some forms of RP show little or no signs on exam.'  "
"How do doctors diagnose retinitis 
pigmentosa?","""Because there are so many variants of RP with different symptoms and signs, the diagnosis may not be straightforward at first. Certain clues in the patient's history (especially retinitis pigmentosa in family members) and complaints (such as difficulty with adapting to the dark) may make one suspect RP. On dilated eye examination, the ophthalmologist may find characteristic clumping of pigment in the retina (a pattern described as bone spicules). This is due to changes in the retinal pigment epithelium, a layer of cells found under the receptors. Other characteristic findings include narrowed retinal arterioles and a waxy appearance of the ""'optic nerve''. Other non-RP eye diseases can show similar patterns in the retina (for example, Kearns-Sayre syndrome and congenital ''syphilis''). Therefore, it may be necessary to perform additional testing to confirm the diagnosis of RP.''Visual field (side-vision) testing is important to making the diagnosis of RP and to document the degree of peripheral visual loss.''The electro retinal exam (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical signals produced by the retinal cells when responding to light. The classic ERG pattern seen in RP shows a markedly diminished rod photoreceptor light-sensing response. The ERG helps distinguish between diseases that predominantly affect rod cells (like RP) from diseases that affect other cells of the retina. For example, the ERG can help distinguish RP from cone-rod dystrophy (CORD), a group of disorders that, as opposed to RP, typically affects central and daytime vision more than peripheral and night vision.''Other conditions such as toxicity from ''drugs'', inflammatory conditions, infections, ischemia, and other forms of age-related retinal degeneration and ''inherited'' retinal dystrophy can affect the retinal pigment epithelium, resulting in pigmentary changes that resemble RP on exam. Here again, the ERG pattern is useful in distinguishing these other retinopathies from RP.''ERG is a painless test. The electroretinogram (ERG), in conjunction with a visual field exam to detect constriction of the visual fields, will usually make the diagnosis of RP.''Additional specialized tests such as EOG, macular optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescein ''angiography'' can help define which portions of the retina are secondarily affected in RP.''Genetic testing may identify the presence of one of the genes associated with RP, and evolving treatment modalities may target these specific gene abnormalities. For example, researchers are developing a promising new gene therapy for congenital amaurosis with the RPE65 gene mutation.

What is the treatment for retinitis pigmentosa?,"'There is no specific cure for RP at this time. Vitamin supplementation studies showed that 15,000 IU a day of ''vitamin A'' palmitate can slow the course of typical forms of RP in adults. Additional supplementation with 12 mg a day of lutein also slowed the disease in some patients.''Take care to avoid side effects. High doses of ''vitamin A'' can be toxic to the ''liver'', may worsen ''osteoporosis'', and may increase ''lung cancer'' risk in ''smokers''. Vitamin A ''supplements'' may harm a developing fetus, therefore women who may become ''pregnant'' should discuss with their doctor reducing their dose and stopping altogether if ''pregnant''. Vitamin A supplementation studies have not been done on children, but many doctors recommend smaller doses based on age and weight.''Studies also suggest that an ''omega-3''-rich ''diet'' containing DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) can further slow disease progression. Such a ''diet'' includes one to two 3-ounce servings per week of oily fish such as salmon, tuna, herring, mackerel, or sardines. ''Vitamin E'' ''supplements'' actually appear to have an adverse effect on the course of RP, therefore, people with RP may want to avoid ''multivitamins'' that provide extra ''vitamin E'' beyond what would normally be found in their ''diet''.''If cystoid macular ''edema'' (CME) develops, it may respond to treatment with ''drugs'' called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAI), taken orally or as eyedrops, or steroids in some cases. If ''cataracts'' develop, doctors can surgically correct them.''Consider genetic diagnostic testing with an ophthalmic geneticist. First, identifying the disease-causing genes may provide patients with a better idea of the prognosis for their particular type of RP. Second, patients may want to seek help from a genetic counselor when planning a family to better understand the odds of passing the genes to the next generation. Some family members may carry the RP genes but show little or no signs of disease. This is often the case with females who carry X-linked recessive RP genes. Finally, a patient could potentially benefit from gene therapy or entering one of the gene-targeted therapy trials under way.'""For patients with advanced late-stage disease, maximization of the patient's visual potential is important. Low-vision services at a low-vision center may help patients select from among various devices including magnifiers, lamps, and video screens. Because of the wide variety of visual disability among RP patients, and because of the progressive nature of the disease, selection of the optimal low-vision aids is very patient-specific.""  "
What is the prognosis for retinitis pigmentosa?,"'The prognosis varies widely among RP patients, with some retaining 20/40 or better vision in at least one eye and others eventually losing all useful central vision. In general, autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa has the best prognosis and X-linked RP is more severe. However, there is tremendous variability among groups and even among family members who share the same genes. Yearly visual field examination can document the course of RP and provide clues as to the prognosis.' "
What is the latest research on retinitis pigmentosa?,"'There is a large amount of research currently being performed both in the United States and internationally. Trials are under way looking at the effects of ciliary neurotrophic factor, ''brimonidine'', nerve growth factors, and many others, as well as open-label gene therapy and stem cell trials. Implantable devices (artificial retina) also are promising to provide some vision to those who have already lost vision from RP and other retinal diseases. Information on current ''clinical trials'' is posted at www.clinicaltrials.gov.' "

What Causes Retinoblastoma?,"'Our eyes begin to develop very early in the womb. Rapidly growing cells in the eye, called retinoblasts, will eventually mature and form the retina, the light-sensing part of the eye that is located in the back of the eye. Sometimes, these specialized cells do not stop reproducing and form a ''tumor'' on the retina. These tumors may continue to grow, filling almost the entire vitreous humor (the jellylike substances the fills the eyeball). These tumors can also break off and spread to other parts of the eye, and eventually outside to ''lymph nodes'' and other organs.' "
Who Gets Retinoblastoma?,"'Retinoblastoma occurs most often in children 5 years and under. It rarely occurs in adults. Between 200 and 300 children are diagnosed with retinoblastoma each year, affecting one in every 20,000. About 40% of all cases of retinoblastoma are ''inherited'', meaning the ''cancer'' is passed on from parent to child. Retinoblastoma occurs about 75% of the time in one eye, and 25% of the time in both eyes.' "
What Are the Symptoms of Retinoblastoma?,"'Symptoms of retinoblastoma include:' A pupil that appears white when light is shone into it, called leucocoria, may mean that a retinal tumor is present. Blood vessels in the back of the eye will normally reflect red. The eyes may not move or focus in the same direction. Eye pain The pupil is constantly dilated. Red eye(s)"
How Is Retinoblastoma Diagnosed?,"'An eye exam and imaging test given by an eye doctor can diagnose retinoblastoma.''If retinoblastoma is suspected, an ophthalmologist will need to examine the eye using special equipment to see the retina. Other tests may be conducted to determine the stage of the retinoblastoma, or how far it has spread. These tests include ''ultrasound'', ''MRI'' scans, ''CT scans'', bone scans, ''spinal tap'', and bone marrow tests.' "
What Are the Stages of Retinoblastoma?,"'Stages of retinoblastoma include:' Intraocular retinoblastoma. The earliest stage of retinoblastoma, found in one or both eyes. It has not yet spread to tissue outside of the eye. Extraocular retinoblastoma. This type of cancer has either spread outside of the eye or to other parts of the body. Recurrent retinoblastoma. The cancer has come back or spread in the eye or to other parts of the body after being treated."
How Is Retinoblastoma Treated?,"'Because it is usually found before it spreads outside of the sclera (white of the eye), retinoblastoma is highly curable. There are also many types of treatment that can save sight in the eye affected by retinoblastoma. Treatments are selected based on the stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis. Options include:' Photocoagulation. A laser is used to kill blood vessels that feed the tumor. Cryotherapy. Extremely low temperatures are used to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a treatment given intravenously (injected into the vein), orally, or is injected into the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, called intrathecal chemotherapy. These powerful doses of cancer-killing medication help kill or slow the growth of multiplying cancerous cells. Radiation therapy. Radiation may be given externally or internally. External-beam radiation therapy uses X-rays to kill cancer cells. Internal, or local radiation therapy, involves placing small amounts of radioactive material inside of or near the tumor to kill cancer cells. Enucleation. Surgery to remove the eye."
What Does the Future Hold for People With Retinoblastoma?,"'Over 90% of children will survive more than five years after being diagnosed with retinoblastoma. Patients are able to retain about 85% of vision in the affected eye after treatment.''Hereditary forms of retinoblastoma are more likely to reoccur years after treatment; therefore, close follow-up after treatment is important for these patients.' "
Is Retinoblastoma Preventable?,"'Because heredity and age play such large roles in retinoblastoma, the best ''prevention'' is through early detection. All ''babies'' should have a general eye exam at birth and then again at six months. A doctor will be able to detect any serious congenital problems or the appearance of retinal tumors. Newborns with a family history of retinoblastoma should have a thorough eye exam a few days after birth, at six weeks, once every three months until age two, and once every four months until age three. The chance is 1 in 2 that a parent will pass on the DNA mutation that causes retinoblastoma. A blood test can be used to determine if this mutation is present.''For adults, prevention means getting a thorough regular eye examination at least once a year and more often, as recommended by your ophthalmologist, if you have a personal or family history of eye disorders or ''diabetes''.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Cole Eye Institute.''Edited by Charlotte E.

What is Reye syndrome?,"'Reye syndrome is a rare but often severe and even fatal illness that primarily occurs in children and adolescents. Children diagnosed with Reye syndrome generally present with ''vomiting'' and mental-status changes. The illness can resolve spontaneously or progress to ''coma'' and death. Although the cause is still unclear, studies have identified that there is a relationship between some viral infections and the use of aspirin medications. The CDC recommended educating parents about the dangers of treating children with aspirin in the 1980s, and now the disease occurs very rarely. In 1963, Dr. Ralph Douglas Reye initially described the syndrome.'  "
What causes Reye syndrome?,"'Although there has been extensive research into the cause of Reye syndrome, medical professionals still do not completely understand it. As mentioned above, the use of aspirin or aspirin-containing medications to treat children with some viral infections, including ''chickenpox'', ''influenza'', and ''gastroenteritis'', is associated with the development of the disease. Ultimately, the causes of symptoms associated with Reye syndrome relate to dysfunction of the ''liver'' and a resultant increase in serum ammonia levels and other toxins. These toxins cause increased pressure in the brain and swelling, leading to brain dysfunction and can progress to death.' "
What are risk factors for Reye syndrome?,"'Most children diagnosed with Reye syndrome have a history of a recent viral infection. Health care providers identify ''chickenpox'' and influenza most often, though they have also described ''rotavirus'' (a cause of bowel inflammation or gastroenteritis). In addition to the recent viral infection, most have a history of taking aspirin to control ''fever''. Some researchers have suggested that children with undiagnosed metabolic disorders may also be at risk, though this is not completely clear.' "
What are Reye syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'The primary symptoms of Reye syndrome include uncontrolled vomiting and mental-status changes. These symptoms are generally the result of increased intracranial pressure and brain swelling. If untreated and progressive, the disease is fatal. Even if physicians identify and treat it early, some patients will still have progressive disease resulting in death or permanent brain damage.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose Reye syndrome?,"'Doctors consider a diagnosis of Reye syndrome in any child who has unexplained brain dysfunction (''encephalopathy''), vomiting, and liver dysfunction. A history of a recent viral infection and aspirin use certainly supports the diagnosis. In general, laboratory studies that reveal a prominent blood acidosis and an increase in liver enzymes and ammonia levels and marked decreases in serum glucose (''hypoglycemia'') are supportive of the diagnosis. However, it should be noted that other metabolic disorders can have with similar symptoms. There are reports of undiagnosed metabolic diseases that may be associated with a patient having Reye syndrome-type physical findings and metabolic derangements. Medical professionals describe these patients as having ""Reye-like syndrome.""' "
What is the treatment for Reye syndrome?,"'Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for Reye syndrome. Primarily, the treatment aims to decrease the effects of the metabolic dysfunction. Health care providers admit patients with Reye syndrome to an intensive care unit where doctors who specialize in the care of critically ill children can manage them. In this setting, they can be monitored for a worsening neurologic and metabolic condition. The primary goal is to manage ''electrolyte'' imbalances and brain swelling. It is difficult to predict which patients will have a progressive illness, however some recommend using medications aimed at lowering the serum ammonia level (ammonia is one cause of increased brain swelling). In addition, in some cases of progressive and resistant Reye syndrome, physicians have used ''hemodialysis'' to remove toxins believed to be partly responsible for the brain swelling.'  "
What is the prognosis for Reye syndrome?,"'There is significant variation in outlook amongst children diagnosed with Reye syndrome. It is dependent upon the severity and progression of the disease. Some children may have mild disease and completely recover, and others may develop permanent dysfunction of the brain or die from the disease. In general, children diagnosed and treated early in the course of the illness have better outcomes. Studies also suggest that those presenting with high ammonia levels have a worse prognosis.' "
Is it possible to prevent Reye syndrome?,"'Although we do not know how to prevent Reye syndrome, we do know that reducing aspirin use in children has resulted in a decrease in the incidence of the illness. In 1980, there were over 500 cases of Reye syndrome in the United States, and now there are only one to two cases per year. The United Kingdom has seen similar statistics, as well. Health officials attribute this remarkable reduction to the cessation of aspirin use in patients less than 18 years of age. It is important to note that several ''over-the-counter products'' contain aspirin or aspirin-like compounds. ''Pepto-Bismol'' is such an example. There is a separate product without aspirin-like compounds available.' "
What is the latest research on Reye syndrome?,"'Most research focuses on understanding what the triggers are for Reye syndrome and how aspirin is involved in the disease. In addition, some are trying to determine why some patients progress rapidly and some cases simply resolve.' "

Facts you should know about rheumatoid factor (RF)," Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that is detectable in the blood of approximately 80% of adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor test is used by health care professionals to help in diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis. Sometimes rheumatoid factor can be detected in the blood of normal individuals and of those with other autoimmune diseases that are not rheumatoid arthritis. In people with rheumatoid arthritis, high levels of rheumatoid factor can indicate a tendency toward more aggressive disease and/or a tendency to develop rheumatoid nodules and/or rheumatoid lung disease."
What is rheumatoid factor?,"'Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that is measurable in the blood with a routine blood test. Rheumatoid factor is actually an antibody that can bind to other antibodies. Antibodies are normal proteins in our blood that are important parts of our immune system. Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that is not usually present in the normal individual. Because rheumatoid factor antibody binds to normal antibodies, it can be generally referred to as an autoantibody. Health care professionals use the rheumatoid factor test to assist in the diagnosis of rheumatoid ''arthritis''.''Rheumatoid factor is sometimes abbreviated as ""RF.""'  "
What is the rheumatoid factor test for?,"'Most commonly, rheumatoid factor is used as a blood test for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor is present in about 80% of adults (but a much lower proportion of children) with rheumatoid arthritis.' "
What are the normal ranges for rheumatoid factor?,"'The ""normal"" range (or negative test result) for rheumatoid factor is less than 14 IU/ml. Any result with values 14 IU/ml or above is considered abnormally high, elevated, or positive.' "
What do high rheumatoid levels mean?,"'High levels of rheumatoid factor (rheumatoid factor ""positive"") are associated with a tendency toward more severe ''rheumatoid disease''. This factor is also associated with a higher tendency to develop non-joint manifestations of rheumatoid disease, such as rheumatoid nodules and rheumatoid lung disease.' "
Can you have high rheumatoid blood levels if you don't have rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Yes. Rheumatoid factor is also present in patients with other conditions, including other connective tissue diseases (such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'"" and Sjögren's syndrome), some infectious diseases (such as infectious ""'hepatitis'', ''syphilis'', ''infectious mononucleosis'', parasites, and ''tuberculosis''), ''liver disease'', and ''sarcoidosis'"". Rheumatoid factor can also sometimes be present in normal individuals without diseases. This occurs more frequently in people with family members who have rheumatoid arthritis. So precise interpretation of rheumatoid factors requires a complete knowledge of the patient's history and medical status."" "
What is radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the liver?,"'Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a technique that uses high frequency electrical energy that creates heat, delivered through a thin instrument known as a probe, to destroy tissue. It is used in the ''liver'' to destroy tumors (either primary liver ''cancers'' or cancers that have metastasized or spread to the liver) that cannot be removed by traditional surgery. ''Radiofrequency ablation also is\xa0 used in many other medical conditions. Examples of other uses of radiofrequency ablation include: ' The management 
of lumbar or low back 
	arthritis pain by ablating nerve tissue to reduce 
	pain 
signals Destruction of areas of the heart that cause
	abnormal heart rhythms 
(arrhythmias) Treatment of
	varicose veins Destruction of tumors in other 
sites of the body, including the
	esophagus, kidney, lung, and prostate."
What are uses of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the liver?,"'Radiofrequency ablation is used to treat hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) of the liver, primary cancers that arise in the liver cells, when these tumors are small and the patient is not an appropriate candidate for surgical removal of the ''tumor'' or liver transplantation. Radiofrequency ablation also can be used on liver tumors that have originated elsewhere in the body and have spread (metastasized) to the liver.' "
What size tumor is treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA)?,"'The maximum size for a liver tumor to be treated by ablation has not been established. However, radiofrequency ablation is best suited for tumors less than 5 cm. Larger tumors may require more than one session.' "
How do I prepare for radiofrequency ablation (RFA)?,"'Your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to prepare for the procedure. You may be advised to stop taking blood-thinner medications before the procedure and not to drink or eat anything for some hours beforehand. Depending on the type of radiofrequency ablation that is done, and whether or not anesthesia is required, you may be able to return home after the procedure, or you may remain overnight in the hospital.' "
What kind of equipment is used for radiofrequency ablation (RFA)?,"'Imaging procedures like CT (computed tomography) scan, ''ultrasound'', or magnetic resonance imaging (''MRI'') are used to help guide the probe into the area of the tumor. The probe is designed like a long needle electrode through which a high-frequency electrical current is passed.' "
How does the radiofrequency ablation (RFA) procedure work?,"'Radiofrequency ablation can be performed in different ways. It may be administered during open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, or percutaneously (through the skin) using imaging studies to guide the placement of the probe. Interventional radiologists are the doctors who most commonly perform RFA through the skin, while surgeons may perform RFA during laparoscopic or open surgeries. ''In all cases of radiofrequency ablation, a probe is inserted into the center of the tumor and the non-insulated electrodes, which are shaped like prongs, are projected out from the central probe into the tumor. The local heat that is generated melts the tissue (in a process known as coagulative necrosis) that is adjacent to the probe. The probe is left in place for about 10 to 15 minutes. For larger tumors it might be necessary to re-position the probe in different areas of the tumor. Imaging studies are done anywhere from a few hours to weeks after the procedure to ensure that the entire tumor tissue has been cauterized.' "
What can expect during radiofrequency ablation (RFA)?,"'Radiofrequency ablation may be done using local anesthesia or general anesthesia (typically if RFA is performed during surgery). Radiofrequency ablation performed by inserting the needle probe through the skin can be done under local anesthesia in which the skin insertion site is numbed. Typically, an intravenous line is placed for delivery of fluid and medications. Monitoring devices to measure heart rate and ''blood pressure'' are attached to the body. ' "
How long does the procedure last?,"'Each radiofrequency ablation typically takes 10-30 minutes. Ablating more than one area requires more time. The entire procedure is usually finished in 1-3 hours. After the procedure, the patient remains in a recovery room until fully awake. ' "
What are the risks and side effects of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy?,"'Radiofrequency ablation is generally well-tolerated, and does not typically cause any serious pain after the treatment. There is a very low risk of bleeding or infection after the treatment as well as a low risk of injury to the gallbladder or bile ducts. Sometimes, a low-grade ''fever'' and ''flu-like symptoms'' may be present after the procedure for a few days. ''\xa0Other possible side effects of radiofrequency ablation include ' post-procedure 
pain,  inflammation of the gallbladder, and  injury to the bowel."
What is the success rate of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy?,"'In most studies, radiofrequency ablation is over 85% successful at destroying small liver tumors. Studies also show that over half of the tumors removed by radiofrequency ablation do not recur (come back). Because the treatment typically does not cause serious health risks, ''chemotherapy'' can be resumed (if needed) soon after the procedure. Radiofrequency ablation usually has few complications, and can be repeated if necessary for the same or additional tumors.' "
What is rhabdomyolysis?,"'Rhabdomyolysis (RAB-DOE-MY-O-LIE-SIS) is the rapid destruction of skeletal muscle resulting in leakage into the urine of the muscle protein myoglobin. ''There are three different types of muscle in the ''human body''; ''The skeletal muscle is the muscle of movement of the body (moving the skeleton at the joints). Skeletal muscle is affected by rhabdomyolysis. ''Myoglobin is a protein component of the muscle cells that is released into the blood when the skeletal muscle is destroyed in rhabdomyolysis. Creatine kinase is an enzyme (a protein that facilitates chemical reactions in the body) also in the muscle cells. The level of each of these proteins can be measured in blood to monitor the degree of muscle injury from rhabdomyolysis. Myoglobin can also be measured in samples of urine. '   smooth muscle,  skeletal 
 muscle, and  heart muscle. "
What causes rhabdomyolysis?,"'Rhabdomyolysis has many causes. Some of the common ones include:' Muscle trauma or crush injury Severe burns Physical torture or child abuse Prolonged lying down on the ground (people who fall or are unconscious and are unable to get up for several hours) Prolonged coma Severe muscle contractions from prolonged seizures Cocaine use with related hyperthermia (increased body temperature) Extreme physical activity (running a marathon, extreme workouts) Drug and alcohol intoxication Low circulating phosphate, potassium, or magnesium levels in the blood (electrolytes) Genetic muscle diseases (familial paroxysmal rhabdomyolysis) Prolonged drowning or hypothermia (low core body temperature) Medications: most notably statins used to treat high cholesterol (simvastatin [Zocor], atorvastatin [Lipitor], pravastatin [Pravachol], or lovastatin [Mevacor]) and other medications such as Parkinson's medication, psychiatric medications, anesthesia medications, HIV medications, colchicine Variety of viruses and some bacteria Severe hypothyroidism (low thyroid level), especially if the person is also taking statin drugs for cholesterol Lack of blood perfusion to a limb Some inflammatory disorders of the muscle, called myopathies, (myositis, dermatomyositis, polymyositis) Venom from certain snake bites (mainly in Africa, Asia, and South America)"
What are the symptoms of rhabdomyolysis?," 

Read Doctor's View
   Rhabdomyolysis may not cause any symptoms at all. Muscle aches and pain (myalgia), stiffness, and muscle weakness can occur with rhabdomyolysis, and is especially common with severe muscle damage. Rhabdomyolysis may cause a darkening of the urine color. Myoglobin is released from the muscles when they break down and is excreted into the urine. This can cause a red or cola color of the urine."
What should I do if I think I have rhabdomyolysis?,"'If you have signs and symptoms suggestive of rhabdomyolysis, your doctor needs to be notified promptly. It is important to realize that these symptoms are not specific for rhabdomyolysis as they may be caused by other conditions.' "
How is rhabdomyolysis diagnosed?,"'Rhabdomyolysis is suggested by the history of recent and past events and the physical examination. It is confirmed by blood and urine testing. An important part of diagnosing rhabdomyolysis is a comprehensive medical history and physical examination.''Of note, CPK is also in heart muscle (''cardiac muscle'') and brain. The laboratory is usually able to distinguish between the different components of this enzyme. For example, the fraction coming from skeletal muscle is referred to as CK-MM and the one from heart muscle is designated as CK-MB. There are small amounts of the CK-MB component in the skeletal muscle as well.'   The medical history may include questions about any medication use, drug and alcohol use, other medical conditions, any trauma or accident, etc. Blood tests include a complete blood count (CBC), a metabolic panel, muscle enzymes, and urinalysis. The levels of myoglobin can be elevated in blood and urine The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis is confirmed by detecting elevated muscle enzymes in blood, which include creatine phosphokinase (CPK), SGOT, SGPT, and LDH . The levels of these enzymes rise as the muscle is destroyed in rhabdomyolysis. While the SGOT, SGPT, and LDH enzymes are found in muscles, they are more frequently associated with the liver. Therefore, elevations of SGOT and SGPT, without elevated CPK, are more typically indications of liver damage."
What are the complications of rhabdomyolysis?," One of the dreaded complications of rhabdomyolysis is kidney failure. This can occur for a variety of reasons. Direct injury to the kidney and plugging of the filtering tubes of the kidneys by the muscle proteins are among the causes of kidney function impairment in the setting of rhabdomyolysis. Another serious complication of rhabdomyolysis is called the compartment syndrome where muscle injury leads to swelling and increased pressure in a confined space (a compartment). This leads to compromised circulation which can endanger the affected tissue. The compartment syndrome is most common after injury in the lower leg, arms, or the muscles of the abdominal wall and can require emergency surgery. Rhabdomyolysis can also cause abnormality of electrolytes in the blood. Because of muscle injury, the contents of the muscle cells can be released into the blood causing high levels of potassium (hyperkalemia) and phosphorus (hyperphosphatemia)."
How is rhabdomyolysis treated?,"'The treatment of rhabdomyolysis depends on its cause and severity. ''If a cause for rhabdomyolysis is identified, it is addressed; for example:''In cases of mild rhabdomyolysis without any evidence of complications, management can take place at home by simply recognizing the cause and correcting it, such as discontinuing a medication and rehydration. ''In more severe cases, or if home therapy is not possible, hospitalization may be required. Prompt initiation of hydration with intravenous fluids, in addition to the removal the provoking factor(s), is an essential part of the treatment of rhabdomyolysis. Monitoring and managing kidney dysfunction, correcting any disturbance in the electrolytes, and monitoring the muscle enzyme levels (CPK, SGOT, SGPT, LDH) are most effectively done in the hospital when rhabdomyolysis is severe. '   discontinuing a toxic medication,  replacing electrolytes, or  treating an 
underlying muscle disease. "
What is the prognosis for rhabdomyolysis?, The overall prognosis of rhabdomyolysis is favorable as long as it is recognized and treated promptly. Most causes of rhabdomyolysis reversible. Severe cases of rhabdomyolysis may be associated with kidney damage and electrolyte imbalance and hospitalization and even dialysis can be required.
What is rheumatic fever?,"'Rheumatic fever (acute rheumatic fever or ARF) is an autoimmune disease that may occur after a group A ''streptococcal throat infection''. Such a reaction to a ''strep'' throat causes inflammatory lesions in connective tissue, the heart, joints and blood vessels of various organs and subcutaneous tissue. The disease has been around since the 1500s, but the association between a throat infection and rheumatic fever symptom development was not described until the 1880s. The ''sore throat'' was later associated with fever and ''rash'' (caused by streptococcal exotoxins) in the 1900s. Prior to the broad availability of ''penicillin'', rheumatic fever was a leading cause of death in children and one of the leading causes of acquired ''heart disease'"" in adults. The disease has many symptoms and can affect different parts of the body, including the heart, joints, skin, and brain. There is no single diagnostic test for rheumatic fever, so the American Heart Association's modified Jones criteria (first published in 1944 and modified in 1992) guide the physician in making the proper diagnosis.""  "
What are the revised Jones criteria for acute rheumatic fever?,"'The revised Jones criteria are guidelines decided on by the American Heart Association to help doctors diagnose rheumatic fever. Two major criteria or one major and two minor criteria plus laboratory evidence of a preceding group A streptococcal (''GAS'') infection are required to make the diagnosis of rheumatic fever.''The major criteria for diagnosis include''The minor criteria for diagnosis include''Evidence of preceding streptococcal infection includes the following:' migratory arthritis of several joints (polyarthritis), heart inflammation (carditis: pericarditis or heart valve disease), nodules under the skin, rapid, jerky movements (Sydenham's chorea, also known as St. Vitus' dance), and a characteristic skin rash (erythema marginatum). fever, elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate or CRP [C-reactive protein], nonspecific laboratory signs of inflammation), joint pain (arthralgia), EKG (electrocardiogram) changes, and history of previous acute rheumatic fever of rheumatic heart disease. Positive throat culture for GAS infection Positive rapid direct GAS throat swab Recent scarlet fever Supporting blood studies for recent GAS infection. These could include rising ASO titers, anti-DNase titers, or antihyaluronidase titers. Measurement of rising ASO titers is the preferred study."
What causes acute rheumatic fever?,"'There is a direct and well-described connection between certain ''streptococcal infections'' and rheumatic fever. Most commonly, rheumatic fever is preceded by a throat infection caused by group A beta-hemolytic ''Streptococcus'' bacteria (''strep'"" throat, GABHS, or GAS). The bacterium causes an autoimmune (antibodies that attack the host's own cells) inflammatory response in some people which leads to the myriad of signs and symptoms described by the revised Jones criteria. Streptococcal throat infections are ""'contagious'', but rheumatic fever is not. The symptoms of rheumatic fever generally develop within two to three weeks following an infection with streptococcal bacteria, and usually the first symptoms are ''painful joints'' or arthritis.' "
What are rheumatic fever symptoms and signs?,"'As mentioned above, there are quite a few symptoms associated with rheumatic fever. Major Jones criteria include the following:''Minor Jones criteria include the following:''Evidence of a preceding GAS infection include a'   Carditis (inflammation of the heart), which occurs in 60% of patients, is the most severe symptom of ARF and can result in permanent damage to the heart valves, heart muscle itself, or tissue surrounding the heart (pericardium). These effects can be life threatening. Polyarthritis or migratory polyarthritis (joint inflammation), which is usually the first presenting symptom of ARF, occurs in 45% of patients. Large joints (knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists) are the most commonly affected. The pain may be moderately painful. Some affected people have small, form, painless lumps beneath the skin that are most common around the wrists, elbows, and knees. These are present in only about 2% if affected people. Erythema marginatum is a characteristic rash that occurs in 5% of patients. The rash is wavy and has a snakelike appearance (serpiginous) that has distinct erythematous (red) borders or ""margins."" The rash is not itchy or painful, starts on the trunk, and expands to involve the extremities. It does not affect the face. Sydenham's chorea occurs in 30% of patients and is a movement disorder comprising of uncontrollable, purposeless, volatile movements of the face and arms. This was also called St. Vitus' dance, which was named after the patron saint of the ""mania dancers"" of the middle ages. This movement disorder is characteristic of ARF and may be associated with emotional disturbances and inappropriate behaviors. This movement disorder may appear months following the GAS throat infection. Fever is often present during the acute infection with group A strep and is present during the initial phase of rheumatic fever. Arthralgia -- sore joints without evidence of swelling, warmth, or associated skin changes Previous rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease Nonspecific laboratory changes of inflammation: elevated white blood cell (WBC) levels, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) Characteristic changes on an electrocardiogram (EKG) positive throat culture for GAS, positive rapid throat test for GAS, recent scarlet fever, or an increase in anti-strep antibodies -- rising ASO, anti-DNase B, or antihyaluronidase titers."
How do health care professionals diagnose rheumatic fever?,"'The person must have a history of an infection with group A streptococcal bacteria, either by laboratory documentation (for example, a positive ''rapid strep test'') or positive strep culture, and must have two major or one major and two minor revised Jones criteria findings.' "
What is the treatment for rheumatic fever?,"'The first step in treating rheumatic fever is to eradicate the bacteria (usually with penicillin) that initially caused the immunologic response. For penicillin-''allergic'' patients, there are other options such as ''erythromycin'' ''azithromycin'"" or a member of the cephalosporin family. It is important to make sure that patients receive treatment for the acute infection, but such treatment won't necessarily change the course of rheumatic fever once the immunologic response has begun. Your doctor will decide on the best treatment option for you. ""'Aspirin'' or aspirin-related medications treat the ''joint pains'"". It may be necessary to use very high doses to decrease the symptoms. (Caution: Do not routinely use aspirin in pediatric patients because of its association with Reye's syndrome.) Consult a pediatric specialist for treatment protocols.""'High-dose steroids treat carditis, but it may be necessary to use other cardiac medications to control the inflammation of the heart. Health care professionals initially manage this serious condition in a hospital.''The most challenging and unpredictable symptom to treat is the chorea (involuntary movements). It often responds to antipsychotic medications such as ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol'"") but may continue for a protracted period. For patients who develop Sydenham's chorea, it can be the most difficult of the symptoms, since it involves involuntary movements and can interfere with daily activities. These individuals must remain on chronic long-term antibiotics to prevent recurrence of the strep infection, as a recurrent strep infection may cause chorea to recur.""  "
Is it possible to prevent rheumatic fever?,"'Prevention'' of rheumatic fever requires the recognition and diagnosis of group A strep throat infections and appropriate antibiotic therapy. In children 5-15 years of age, strep throat infections are very common and appear as a sudden onset of throat ''pain'', fever, ''headache'', and ''abdominal pain''. Generally, patients with strep throat do not have symptoms such as ''runny nose'', ''nasal congestion'', ''cough'', or other symptoms more commonly seen with a routine ''upper respiratory infection'' (URI, or the ''common cold''). Most providers either test for a GAS infection with a rapid strep test or throat culture. Most causes of ''sore throat'' are not bacterial but are viral, do not carry the risk of rheumatic fever, and cannot be treated with antibiotics. In addition, once an individual develops rheumatic fever after a strep throat infection, that individual remains at risk for subsequent episodes of rheumatic fever during subsequent strep throat infections. These individuals may need to receive chronic long-term prophylaxis (preventive treatment) with antibiotics. Researchers continue to attempt development of a ''vaccine'' against group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, but currently no vaccine is available.''Infectious disease specialists emphasize the importance of preventing recurrent episodes of ARF. There are several options varying from a once a month long-acting injection of penicillin to daily oral antibiotics. The guidelines currently recommend a prophylactic (preventative) antibiotic regimen for patients without carditis for five years or to 21 years of age (whichever is longer). For those with carditis but no residual heart disease, prevention should be for 10 years or well into adulthood (whichever is longer). Those who have residual heart disease because of carditis are advised to utilize antibiotic prophylaxis until 40 years of age and some specialists recommend lifelong therapy.' "
What are the complications of rheumatic fever?,"'The most concerning of the complications of ARF are cardiac in nature. Patients with rheumatic fever who develop carditis may develop long-lasting heart dysfunction. Often the ''mitral valve'' or the ''aortic valve'' is affected. For patients not responsive to medications, surgical valve replacement may become necessary. ''Atrial fibrillation'' (irregular fast heart rate) and ''heart failure'"" can occur. Sydenham's chorea can be the most difficult complication to treat, and the individuals with this complication may get recurrence of the movement disorder. A few people remain very susceptible to reinfection with GABHS and may require lifetime antibiotic treatment."" "
How common is rheumatic fever?,"'In the United States and other developed nations, rheumatic fever is exceedingly rare today, though there have been sporadic outbreaks. This is due to the availability of antibiotics and preventive services. In other parts of the world, it remains a common disease and is the leading cause of cardiovascular death in individuals under the age of 50.' "
Facts you should know about rheumatoid arthritis (RA),"   Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms includejoint pain, such as in the joints of the feet, hands, and knees,swollen joints,fever,limping,loss of range of motion,tender joints,loss of joint function,stiff joints,fatigue,joint redness,rheumatoid nodules,anemia,joint warmth,joint deformity, andsymptoms and signs that affect both sides of the body (symmetry). joint pain, such as in the joints of the feet, hands, and knees, swollen joints, fever, limping, loss of range of motion, tender joints, loss of joint function, stiff joints, fatigue, joint redness, rheumatoid nodules, anemia, joint warmth, joint deformity, and symptoms and signs that affect both sides of the body (symmetry). In rheumatoid arthritis, multiple joints are usually, but not always, affected (polyarthritis) in a symmetrical pattern. Damage to joints can occur early and does not always correlate with the severity of RA symptoms. The ""rheumatoid factor"" is an antibody that can be found in the blood of 80% of people with rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor is detected in a simple blood test. Possible risk factors for developing rheumatoid arthritis include genetic background, smoking, silica inhalation, periodontal disease, and microbes in the bowels (gut bacteria). There is no cure for RA. The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis optimally involves a combination of patient education, rest and exercise, joint protection, medicines, and occasionally surgery. Early RA treatment results in a better prognosis. The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not known. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect people of all ages. NSAIDs, DMARDs, TNF alpha inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, T-cell activation inhibitors, B-cell depleters, JAK inhibitors, immunosuppressants, and steroids treat RA. Researchers have developed medicines that are biosimilar to biologic drugs, and many others are currently under study."
What is rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the joints. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body\'s tissues are mistakenly attacked by their own immune system. The immune system contains a complex organization of cells and antibodies designed normally to ""seek and destroy"" invaders of the body, particularly infections. Patients with autoimmune diseases have antibodies and immune cells in their blood that target their own body tissues, where they can be associated with inflammation. While joint tissue inflammation and inflammatory arthritis are classic RA features, the disease can also cause extra-articular inflammation and injury in other organs.''Because it can affect multiple other organs of the body, rheumatoid arthritis is referred to as a systemic illness and is sometimes called rheumatoid disease.' Rheumatoid arthritis is a classic rheumatic disease. Rheumatoid arthritis that begins in people under 16 years of age is referred to as juvenile idiopathic arthritis or JIA (formerly juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or JRA)."
What are rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and signs?,"'RA symptoms come and go, depending on the degree of tissue inflammation. When body tissues are inflamed, the disease is active. When tissue inflammation subsides, the disease is inactive (in remission). Remissions can occur spontaneously or with treatment and can last weeks, months, or years. During remissions, symptoms of the disease disappear, and people generally feel well. When the disease becomes active again (relapse), symptoms return. The return of disease activity and symptoms is called a flare. The course of rheumatoid arthritis varies among affected individuals, and periods of flares and remissions are typical.''When the disease is active, RA symptoms and signs can include''People with active inflammation of joints from RA can also experience''Muscle and ''joint stiffness'' are usually most notable in the morning and after periods of inactivity. This is referred to as morning stiffness and post-sedentary stiffness. Arthritis is common during disease flares. Also during flares, joints frequently become warm, red, swollen, painful, and tender. This occurs because the lining tissue of the joint (synovium) becomes inflamed, resulting in the production of excessive joint fluid (synovial fluid). The synovium also thickens with inflammation (synovitis).''Rheumatoid arthritis usually inflames multiple joints and affects both sides of the body. In its most common form, therefore, it is referred to as a symmetric polyarthritis.'

   fatigue, loss of energy, lack of appetite, low-grade fever, muscle and joint pain, joint redness, joint swelling, joint tenderness, joint warmth, joint deformity, rheumatoid nodules, stiffness, loss of joint range of motion, loss of joint function, and limping. depression, anemia frustration, and social withdrawal. Early rheumatoid arthritis symptoms may be subtle. The small joints of both the hands and wrists are often involved. Early symptoms of RA can be pain and prolonged stiffness of joints, particularly in the morning. Symptoms in the hands with rheumatoid arthritis include difficulty with simple tasks of daily living, such as turning door knobs and opening jars. The small joints of the feet are also commonly involved, which can lead to painful walking, especially in the morning after arising from bed. Occasionally, only one joint is inflamed. When only one joint is involved, the arthritis can mimic the joint inflammation caused by other forms of arthritis, such as gout or joint infection. Chronic inflammation can cause damage to body tissues, including cartilage and bone. This leads to a loss of cartilage and erosion and weakness of the bones as well as the muscles, resulting in joint deformity, loss of range of motion, destruction, and loss of function. Rarely, rheumatoid arthritis can even affect the joint that is responsible for the tightening of our vocal cords to change the tone of our voice, the cricoarytenoid joint. When this joint is inflamed, it can cause hoarseness of the voice. Symptoms in children with rheumatoid arthritis include limping, irritability, crying, and poor appetite."
Rheumatoid arthritis vs. osteoarthritis,"'Rheumatoid arthritis is a destructive joint disease that is caused by inflammation in the tissue that normally produces lubrication fluid for joints. When this tissue remains inflamed, it leads to deformity by loosening joint ligaments and to joint destruction by eroding away cartilage and bone.''Osteoarthritis'' is a noninflammatory joint disease whereby the cartilage of the joint thins, typically asymmetrically -- so only one knee or hand may be affected. The illustration on the previous page shows the difference between a normal joint and those of ''osteoarthritis'' and rheumatoid arthritis.''While rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic illness, meaning it can last for years, patients may experience long periods without symptoms. However, rheumatoid arthritis is typically a progressive illness that has the potential to cause significant joint destruction and functional disability.''A joint is where two bones meet to allow movement of body parts. Arthritis means joint inflammation. The joint inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis causes swelling, pain, stiffness, and redness in the joints. The inflammation of rheumatoid disease can also occur in tissues around the joints, such as the tendons, ligaments, and muscles.''In some people with rheumatoid arthritis, chronic inflammation leads to the destruction of the cartilage, bone, and ligaments, causing deformity of the joints. Damage to the joints can occur early in the disease and be progressive. Moreover, studies have shown that the progressive damage to the joints does not necessarily correlate with the degree of pain, stiffness, or swelling present in the joints.''Rheumatoid arthritis is a common rheumatic disease, affecting approximately 1.3 million people in the United States, according to current census data. The disease is three times more common in women as in men. It afflicts people of all races equally. The disease can begin at any age and even affects children (''juvenile idiopathic arthritis''), but it most often starts after 40 years of age and before 60 years of age. Though uncommon, in some families, multiple members can be affected, suggesting a genetic basis for the disorder.'

What are rheumatoid arthritis causes and risk factors?,"'The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown. Even though infectious agents such as ''viruses'', bacteria, and fungi have long been suspected, none has been proven as the cause. The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is a very active area of worldwide research. It is believed that the tendency to develop rheumatoid arthritis may be genetically ''inherited'"" (hereditary). Certain genes have been identified that increase the risk for rheumatoid arthritis. It is also suspected that certain infections or factors in the environment might trigger the activation of the immune system in susceptible individuals. This misdirected immune system then attacks the body's own tissues. This leads to inflammation in the joints and sometimes in various organs of the body, such as the ""'lungs'' or eyes.''It is not known what triggers the onset of rheumatoid arthritis. Regardless of the exact trigger, the result is an immune system that is geared up to promote inflammation in the joints and occasionally other tissues of the body. Immune cells, called lymphocytes, are activated and chemical messengers (cytokines, such as ''tumor'' necrosis factor/TNF, interleukin-1/IL-1, and interleukin-6/IL-6) are expressed in the inflamed areas.''Environmental factors also seem to play some role in causing rheumatoid arthritis. For example, scientists have reported that ''smoking'' tobacco, exposure to silica mineral, and chronic periodontal disease all increase the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.''There are theories about gut bacteria (the microbiome of gut microbes that naturally exist in the lining of the bowels) that may trigger the onset of RA in genetically susceptible people. No specific microbes have been identified as definite causes.' "
What are rheumatoid arthritis complications?,"'Since rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease, its inflammation can affect organs and areas of the body other than the joints.' Arthritis-related inflammation of the glands of the eyes and mouth can cause dryness of these areas and is referred to as Sjögren's syndrome. Dryness of the eyes can lead to corneal abrasion. Inflammation of the white parts of the eyes (the sclerae) is referred to as scleritis and can be very dangerous to the eye. Rheumatoid inflammation of the lung lining (pleuritis) causes chest pain with deep breathing, shortness of breath, or coughing. The lung tissue itself can also become inflamed and scarred, and sometimes nodules of inflammation (rheumatoid nodules) develop within the lungs. Inflammation of the tissue (pericardium) surrounding the heart, called pericarditis, can cause a chest pain that typically changes in intensity when lying down or leaning forward. Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with an increased risk for heart attack. Rheumatoid disease can reduce the number of red blood cells (anemia) and white blood cells. Decreased white cells can be associated with an enlarged spleen (referred to as Felty's syndrome) and can increase the risk of infections. The risk of lymph gland cancer (lymphoma) is higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, especially in those with sustained active joint inflammation. Firm lumps or firm bumps under the skin (subcutaneous nodules called rheumatoid nodules) can occur around the elbows and fingers where there is frequent pressure. Even though these nodules usually do not cause symptoms, occasionally they can become infected. Nerves can become pinched in the wrists to cause carpal tunnel syndrome. A rare, serious complication, usually with longstanding rheumatoid disease, is blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis). Vasculitis can impair blood supply to tissues and lead to tissue death (necrosis). This is most often initially visible as tiny black areas around the nail beds or as leg ulcers."
What tests do physicians use to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis?,"'There is no singular test for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis. The diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation. Ultimately, rheumatoid arthritis is diagnosed based on a combination of the following:''Understand that many forms of joint disease mimic rheumatoid arthritis.'   Presentation of the joints involved Characteristic joint swelling and stiffness in the morning The presence of blood rheumatoid factor (RF blood test or RA test) and citrulline antibody The presence of rheumatoid nodules and radiographic changes (X-ray testing) The first step in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is a meeting between the doctor and the patient. The doctor reviews the history of symptoms. Then the doctor checks the joints for inflammation, tenderness, swelling, and deformity and looks for rheumatoid skin nodules. Rheumatoid nodules are firm lumps or bumps under the skin, most commonly over the elbows or fingers). The doctor will also check other parts of the body for inflammation. Certain blood and X-ray tests are often obtained. The diagnosis will be based on the pattern of symptoms, the distribution of the inflamed joints, and the blood and X-ray findings. Several visits may be necessary before the doctor can be certain of the diagnosis. A doctor with special training in arthritis and related diseases is called a rheumatologist. Joint inflammation helps to distinguish rheumatoid arthritis from common types of arthritis that are not inflammatory, such as osteoarthritis or degenerative arthritis. The distribution of joint inflammation is also important to the doctor in making a diagnosis. In rheumatoid arthritis, the small joints of the hands and fingers, wrists, feet, and knees are typically inflamed in a symmetrical distribution (affecting both sides of the body). When only one or two joints are inflamed, the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis becomes more difficult. The doctor may then perform other tests to exclude arthritis due to infection or gout. The detection of rheumatoid nodules (described above), most often around the elbows and fingers, can suggest the diagnosis. Abnormal antibodies can be found in the blood of people with rheumatoid arthritis with simple blood testing. An antibody called ""rheumatoid factor"" (RF) can be found in 80% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatoid factor are referred to as having ""seropositive rheumatoid arthritis."" Patients who are felt to have rheumatoid arthritis and do not have positive rheumatoid factor testing are referred to as having ""seronegative rheumatoid arthritis."" Citrulline antibody (also referred to as anti-citrulline antibody, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and anti-CCP antibody) is present in 50%-75% people with rheumatoid arthritis. It is useful in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis when evaluating cases of unexplained joint inflammation. A test for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies helps in looking for the cause of previously undiagnosed inflammatory arthritis when rheumatoid factor is not present. Citrulline antibodies have been felt to represent the earlier stages of rheumatoid arthritis in this setting. Citrulline antibodies also have been associated with more aggressive forms of rheumatoid arthritis. Another antibody called the ""antinuclear antibody"" (ANA) is also frequently found in people with rheumatoid arthritis. It should be noted that many forms of arthritis in childhood (juvenile inflammatory arthritis) are not associated with blood test positivity for rheumatoid factors. In this setting, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis must be distinguished from other types of joint inflammation. These include plant thorn arthritis, joint injury, arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease, and rarely joint tumors. A blood test called the sedimentation rate (sed rate) is a crude measure of the inflammation of the joints. The sed rate actually measures how fast red blood cells fall to the bottom of a test tube. The sed rate is usually faster (high) during disease flares and slower (low) during remissions. Another blood test that is used to measure the degree of inflammation present in the body is the C-reactive protein. Blood testing may also reveal anemia, since anemia is common in rheumatoid arthritis, particularly because of the chronic inflammation. The rheumatoid factor, ANA, sed rate, and C-reactive protein tests can also be abnormal in other systemic autoimmune and inflammatory medical conditions. Therefore, abnormalities in these blood tests alone are not sufficient for a firm diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Joint X-rays may be normal or only show swelling of soft tissues early in the disease. As the disease progresses, X-rays can reveal bony erosions typical of rheumatoid arthritis in the joints. Joint X-rays can also be helpful in monitoring the progression of disease and joint damage over time. Bone scanning, a procedure using a small amount of a radioactive substance, can also be used to show the inflamed joints. MRI scanning can also be used to show joint damage. The doctor may elect to perform an office procedure called arthrocentesis. In this procedure, a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain joint fluid out of the joint for study in the laboratory. Analysis of the joint fluid in the laboratory can help to exclude other causes of arthritis, such as infection and gout. Arthrocentesis can also be helpful in relieving joint swelling and pain. Occasionally, cortisone medicines are injected into the joint during the arthrocentesis in order to rapidly relieve joint inflammation and further reduce symptoms."
What are the 4 stages of rheumatoid arthritis?,"'The American College of ''Rheumatology'' has developed a system for classifying rheumatoid arthritis that is primarily based upon the X-ray appearance of the joints. This system helps medical professionals classify the severity of your rheumatoid arthritis with respect to cartilage, ligaments, and bone.''Stage I (early RA)''Stage II (moderate progressive)''Stage III (severe progression)''Stage IV (terminal progression)''Rheumatologists'' also classify the functional status of people with rheumatoid arthritis as follows:' No damage seen on X-rays, although there may be signs of bone thinning On X-ray, evidence of bone thinning around a joint with or without slight bone damage Slight cartilage damage possible Joint mobility may be limited; no joint deformities observed Atrophy of adjacent muscle Abnormalities of soft tissue around joint possible On X-ray, evidence of cartilage and bone damage and bone thinning around the joint Joint deformity without permanent stiffening or fixation of the joint Extensive muscle atrophy Abnormalities of soft tissue around joint possible On X-ray, evidence of cartilage and bone damage and osteoporosis around joint Joint deformity with permanent fixation of the joint (referred to as ankylosis) Extensive muscle atrophy Abnormalities of soft tissue around joint possible Class I: completely able to perform usual activities of daily living Class II: able to perform usual self-care and work activities but limited in activities outside of work (such as playing sports, household chores) Class III: able to perform usual self-care activities but limited in work and other activities Class IV: limited in ability to perform usual self-care, work, and other activities"
What are rheumatoid arthritis treatment options?," There is no known cure for rheumatoid arthritis. To date, the goal of treatment in rheumatoid arthritis is to reduce joint inflammation and pain, maximize joint function, and prevent joint destruction and deformity. Early medical intervention has been shown to be important in improving outcomes. Aggressive management can improve function, stop damage to joints as monitored on X-rays, and prevent work disability. Optimal RA treatment involves a combination of medicines, rest, joint-strengthening exercises, joint protection, and patient (and family) education. Treatment is customized according to many factors such as disease activity, types of joints involved, general health, age, and patient occupation. RA treatment is most successful when there is close cooperation between the doctor, patient, and family members."
What are types of rheumatoid arthritis medicines?,"'Two classes of medicines are used in treating rheumatoid arthritis: fast-acting ""first-line drugs"" and slow-acting ""second-line drugs"" (also referred to as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or DMARDs).''The degree of destructiveness of RA varies among affected individuals. Those with less destructive RA or disease that has quieted after many active years can manage their RA with rest plus pain control and anti-inflammatory drugs. Early treatment with second-line drugs (DMARD) improves function and minimizes disability and joint destruction, even within months of the diagnosis. Most people require more aggressive second-line drugs, such as methotrexate, in addition to anti-inflammatory agents. Sometimes these second-line drugs are used in combination.'   The first-line drugs, such as aspirin and cortisone (corticosteroids [Rayos, Celestone, Depo-Medrol, Kenalog]), are used to reduce pain and inflammation. The slow-acting second-line drugs, such as methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall, Otrexup, Rasuvo) and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), promote disease remission and prevent progressive joint destruction. The areas of the body other than the joints that are affected by rheumatoid inflammation are treated individually. Sjögren's syndrome can be helped by artificial tears and humidifying rooms in the home or office. Medicated eyedrops, cyclosporine ophthalmic drops (Restasis), are also available to help the dry eyes in those affected. Regular eye checkups and early antibiotic treatment for infection of the eyes are important. Inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis), bursae (bursitis), and rheumatoid nodules can be injected with cortisone. Inflammation of the lining of the heart and/or lungs may require high doses of oral cortisone. In some cases with severe joint deformity, surgery may be recommended to restore joint mobility or repair damaged joints. Doctors who specialize in joint surgery are orthopedic surgeons. The types of joint surgery range from arthroscopy to partial and complete replacement of the joint. Arthroscopy is a surgical technique whereby a doctor inserts a tube-like instrument into the joint to see and repair abnormal tissues. Total joint replacement is a surgical procedure whereby a destroyed joint is replaced with artificial materials. For example, the small joints of the hand can be replaced with plastic material. Large joints, such as the hips or knees, are replaced with metals."
"""First-line"" rheumatoid arthritis medicines","'Acetylsalicylate (aspirin), ''naproxen'' (''Naprosyn''), ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', Medipren, ''Motrin''), ''etodolac'' (Lodine), and ''diclofenac'' (''Voltaren'') are examples of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs are medicines that can reduce tissue inflammation, pain, and swelling. NSAIDs are not cortisone. Aspirin, in doses higher than those used in treating ''headaches'"" and fever, is an effective anti-inflammatory medication for rheumatoid arthritis. Aspirin has been used for joint problems since the ancient Egyptian era. The newer NSAIDs are just as effective as aspirin in reducing inflammation and pain and require fewer dosages per day. Patients' responses to different ""'NSAID'' medicines vary. Therefore, it is not unusual for a medical professional to try several NSAID drugs in order to identify the most effective agent with the fewest side effects. The most common side effects of aspirin and other NSAIDs include stomach upset, ''abdominal pain'', ulcers, and even gastrointestinal bleeding. In order to reduce gastrointestinal side effects, NSAIDs are usually taken with food. Additional medicines are frequently recommended to protect the stomach from the ulcer effects of NSAIDs. These medicines include antacids, ''sucralfate'' (''Carafate''), proton-pump inhibitors (''Prevacid'' and others), and ''misoprostol'' (''Cytotec''). Newer NSAIDs include selective ''Cox-2 inhibitors'', such as ''celecoxib'' (''Celebrex''), which offer anti-inflammatory effects with less risk of stomach irritation and bleeding risk.''Corticosteroid'' medicines can be given orally or injected directly into joints (intra-articular injections) and tissues. They are more potent than NSAIDs in reducing inflammation and in restoring joint mobility and function. Corticosteroids are useful for short periods during severe flares of disease activity or when the disease is not responding to NSAIDs. However, corticosteroids can have serious side effects, especially when given in high doses for long periods of time. These side effects include ''weight gain'', facial puffiness, thinning of the skin and bone, ''easy bruising'', ''cataracts'', risk of infection, muscle wasting, and destruction of large joints, such as the hips. Corticosteroids also carry some increased risk of contracting infections. These side effects can be partially avoided by gradually tapering the doses of corticosteroids as the patient achieves improvement in symptoms. Abruptly discontinuing corticosteroids can lead to flares of the disease or other symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal and is discouraged. Thinning of the bones due to ''osteoporosis'' may be prevented by calcium and ''vitamin D'' ''supplements''.' "
"""Second-line"" or ""slow-acting"" rheumatoid arthritis drugs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or DMARDs)","'While ""first-line"" medicines (NSAIDs and corticosteroids) can relieve joint inflammation and pain, they do not necessarily prevent joint destruction or deformity. Rheumatoid arthritis requires medicines other than NSAIDs and corticosteroids to stop progressive damage to cartilage, bone, and adjacent soft tissues. The RA medicines needed for ideal management of the disease are also referred to as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or DMARDs. They come in a variety of forms and are listed below. These ""second-line"" or ""slow-acting"" medicines may take weeks to months to become effective. They are used for long periods, even years, at varying doses. If maximally effective, DMARDs can promote remission, thereby retarding the progression of joint destruction and deformity. Sometimes a number of DMARD second-line medicines are used together as combination therapy. As with the first-line medicines, the doctor may need to try different second-line medicines before treatment is optimal.''Research suggests that patients who respond to a DMARD with control of the rheumatoid disease may lower the known risk of lymphoma that exists from simply having RA. The various available DMARDs are reviewed next.''Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) is related to quinine and has also been used in the treatment of ''malaria''. It is used over long periods for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Possible side effects include ''upset stomach'', skin ''rashes'', muscle weakness, and vision changes. Even though vision changes are rare, people taking Plaquenil should be monitored by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist).''Sulfasalazine'' (Azulfidine) is an oral medication traditionally used in the treatment of mild to moderately severe ''inflammatory bowel diseases'', such as ''ulcerative colitis'"" and Crohn's ""'colitis''. Azulfidine is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in combination with anti-inflammatory medicines. Azulfidine is generally well tolerated. Common side effects include ''rash'' and ''upset stomach''. Because Azulfidine is made up of sulfa and salicylate compounds, it should be avoided by people with known sulfa ''allergies''.''Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall, Otrexup, Rasuvo) has gained popularity among doctors as an initial second-line drug because of its effectiveness and infrequent side effects. It also has an advantage in dose flexibility (dosages can be adjusted according to needs). Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug. It can affect the bone marrow and the ''liver'', even rarely causing ''cirrhosis''. All people taking methotrexate require regular blood tests to monitor blood counts and ''liver function''. Taking ''folic acid'' as a supplement can reduce the risk of methotrexate side effects.''Gold salts have been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis throughout most of the past century. Gold thioglucose (Solganal) and gold thiomalate (''Myochrysine'') are given by injection, initially on a weekly basis, for months to years. Oral gold, ''auranofin'' (''Ridaura''), was introduced in the 1980s. Side effects of gold (oral and injectable) include skin ''rash'', ''mouth sores'', kidney damage with leakage of ''protein in the urine'', and bone marrow damage with anemia and low white cell count. Those receiving gold treatment are regularly monitored with blood and urine tests. Oral gold can cause ''diarrhea''. These gold drugs have lost favor in the treatment of RA because of the availability of more effective treatments, particularly methotrexate.''D-''penicillamine'' (''Depen'', ''Cuprimine'') can be helpful in selected cases of progressive forms of rheumatoid arthritis. Side effects are similar to those of gold. They include fever, ''chills'', ''mouth sores'', a ''metallic taste in the mouth'', skin rash, kidney and bone marrow damage, stomach upset, and ''easy bruising''. People taking this medication require routine blood and urine tests. D-penicillamine can rarely cause symptoms of other autoimmune diseases and is no longer commonly used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.'""Immunosuppressive medicines are powerful medicines that suppress the body's immune system. A number of immunosuppressive drugs are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. They include methotrexate as described above, ""'azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), ''chlorambucil'' (''low platelet count''Immunosuppressive medicines can depress bone marrow function and cause anemia, a low white cell count, and low platelet counts. A low white count can increase the risk of infections, while a low ''platelet count'' can increase the risk of bleeding. Methotrexate rarely can lead to liver ''cirrhosis'', as described above, and ''allergic'' reactions in the lung. Cyclosporine can cause kidney damage and ''high blood pressure'' (''hypertension''). Because of potentially serious side effects, immunosuppressive medicines are used in low doses, usually in combination with anti-inflammatory agents.''Researchers have shown that combinations of traditional DMARDs, including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and hydroxychloroquine, are another potent method of stopping the progression of RA.' "
What are newer rheumatoid arthritis medications and side effects?,"'Newer ""second-line"" drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis include the following:''Each of these medicines can increase the risk for infections, and the development of any infections should be reported to the doctor when taking these newer second-line drugs.''While biologic drugs are often combined with DMARDs in the treatment of RA, they are generally not used with other biologics due to the risk of serious infections. Similarly, JAK inhibitor medication is not used with traditional biologic medicines.'

It seems to work by blocking the action of an important enzyme that has a role in immune activation. Leflunomide can cause liver disease, diarrhea, hair loss, and/or rash in some people. It should not be taken just before or during pregnancy because of possible birth defects and is generally avoided in women who might become pregnant. Biologic DMARDs represent a novel approach to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and are products of modern biotechnology. These are referred to as the biologic agents or biological response modifiers. In comparison with traditional DMARDs, the biologic medications have a much more rapid onset of action and can have powerful effects on stopping progressive joint damage. In general, their methods of action are also more directed, defined, and targeted. Etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol are biologic drugs that intercept tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the joints; TNF promotes joint inflammation in RA. These TNF-blockers intercept TNF before it can act on its natural receptor to ""switch on"" the process of inflammation. This effectively blocks the TNF inflammation messenger from recruiting the cells of inflammation. Symptoms can be significantly, and often rapidly, improved in those using these drugs. Etanercept must be injected subcutaneously once or twice a week. Infliximab is given by infusion directly into a vein (intravenously). Adalimumab is injected subcutaneously either every other week or weekly. Golimumab is injected subcutaneously on a monthly basis. Certolizumab pegol is injected subcutaneously every two to four weeks. Each of these medicines is being evaluated by health care professionals in practice to determine what role they may have in treating patients in various stages of rheumatoid arthritis. Research has shown that biological response modifiers also prevent the progressive joint destruction of rheumatoid arthritis. They are currently recommended for use after other second-line medicines have not been effective. The biological response modifiers (TNF-inhibitors) are expensive treatments. They are also frequently used in combination with methotrexate and other DMARDs. Furthermore, it should be noted that the TNF-blocking biologics all are more effective when combined with methotrexate. People with significant congestive heart failure or demyelinating diseases (such as multiple sclerosis) should avoid these medicines because they can worsen these medical conditions. Biosimilar TNF-blockers include etanercept-szzs (Erelzi), adalimumab-atto (Amjevita), infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra), and infliximab-abda (Renflexis). Anakinra (Kineret) is another biologic DMARD treatment that is used to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Anakinra works by binding to a cell messenger protein (IL-1, a pro-inflammatory cytokine). Anakinra is injected under the skin daily. Anakinra can be used alone or with other DMARDs. The response rate of anakinra does not seem to be as high as with other biologic medicines. Rituximab (Rituxan) is an antibody that was first used to treat lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes. Rituximab can be effective in treating autoimmune diseases like RA because it depletes B-cells. These are important cells of inflammation that produce abnormal antibodies that are common in these medical conditions. Rituximab is used to treat moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have failed treatment with the TNF-blocking biologics. Preliminary studies have shown that Rituximab was also found to be beneficial in treating severe rheumatoid arthritis complicated by blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis) and cryoglobulinemia. Rituximab is an intravenous infusion given in two doses, two weeks apart, approximately every six months. Biosimilar versions of rituximab are under study. Abatacept (Orencia) is a biologic medication that blocks T-cell activation. Abatacept is used to treat adult patients who have failed treatment with a traditional DMARD medication. Abatacept is an intravenous infusion given monthly or a weekly subcutaneous injection. Tocilizumab (Actemra) and sarilumab (Kevzara) can treat adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had a poor response to one or more DMARD. Tocilizumab is the first approved biologic medication that blocks interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is a chemical messenger of the inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab is an intravenous infusion given monthly or a weekly subcutaneous injection. Sarilumab also blocks IL-6. Tofacitinib (Xeljanz) is the first in a new class of medicines used to treat rheumatoid arthritis called JAK inhibitors. Tofacitinib and baricitinib (Olumiant) treat adults with moderately to severely active RA in which methotrexate did not work well and who have failed a TNF-blocker biologic. Tofacitinib can be used with or without methotrexate. This prescription medicine is taken by mouth once or twice daily. Baricitinib (Olumiant) is also an oral medication taken once daily. Tofacitinib and baricitinib are ""targeted"" medicines that specifically block special enzymes of inflammation in joints (called Janus kinase) within cells. For this reason, medical professionals call tofacitinib and baricitinib JAK inhibitors."
"Rheumatoid arthritis diet, exercise, therapy, home remedies, and alternative medicine","'There is no special RA ''diet'' or ''diet'' ""cure"" for rheumatoid arthritis. One hundred years ago, it was touted that ""night-shade"" foods, such as tomatoes, would aggravate rheumatoid arthritis. This is no longer accepted as true. There are no specific foods or food groups that should be universally avoided by individuals with rheumatoid arthritis.''There is no evidence that ''gluten'' bothers rheumatoid arthritis. Nevertheless, for those who are definitely sensitive to gluten (wheat, barley, and rye), the ''gluten-free diet'' can prevent poor intestinal absorption of important nutrients. Bowel inflammation can be detrimental for those with RA if they become deficient in nutrients, such as ''vitamin D'' and folate.''Nevertheless, some home remedies may be helpful, although these are not considered as potent or effective as disease-modifying drugs. Fish oils, such as in salmon, and ''omega-3 fatty acids'' ''supplements'' have been shown to be beneficial in some short-term studies in rheumatoid arthritis. This suggests that there may be benefits by adding more fish to the diet, such as in the popular ''Mediterranean diet''. The anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin in dietary turmeric, an ingredient in curry, may be beneficial in reducing ''symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis''.''Supplements such as calcium and ''vitamin D'' are used to prevent ''osteoporosis'' in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Folic acid is used as a supplement to prevent side effects of methotrexate treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. ''Alcohol'' is minimized or avoided in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking methotrexate.''The benefits of cartilage preparations such as ''glucosamine'' and chondroitin for rheumatoid arthritis remain unproven. Symptomatic pain relief can often be achieved with oral ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''over-the-counter'' topical preparations, which are rubbed into the skin. Antibiotics, in particular the ''tetracycline'' drug ''minocycline'' (''Minocin''), have been tried for rheumatoid arthritis recently in ''clinical trials''. Early results have shown mild to moderate improvement in the symptoms of arthritis. Minocycline has been shown to impede important mediator enzymes of tissue destruction, called metalloproteinases, in the laboratory as well as in humans.'""Impact loading joints can aggravate inflamed, active RA; it's also difficult when joints have been injured in the past by the disease. So, it is important to customize activities and ""'exercise'"" programs according to each individual's capacity. Physical therapy can be helpful. Exercises that are less traumatic for the joints, including ""'yoga'' and ''tai chi'', can be beneficial in maintaining flexibility and strength. They also lead to an improved general sense of well-being.''Proper regular exercise is important in maintaining joint mobility and in strengthening the muscles around the joints. ''Swimming'' is particularly helpful because it allows exercise with minimal ''stress'' on the joints. Physical and occupational therapists are trained to provide specific exercise instructions and can offer splinting supports. For example, wrist and finger splints can be helpful in reducing inflammation and maintaining joint alignment. Devices such as canes, toilet seat raisers, and jar grippers can assist in the activities of daily living. Heat and ''cold'' applications are modalities that can ease symptoms before and after exercise.'  "
What about rheumatoid arthritis and pregnancy?,"'In general, rheumatoid arthritis often improves during pregnancy. It is commonplace for the rheumatoid joint inflammation to decrease and be minimized during pregnancy. Unfortunately, this reduction of joint inflammation during pregnancy is not usually sustained after delivery.' Do not use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve) and others, during pregnancy. Women should not use methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) or cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune) during pregnancy. They must discontinue their use well in advance of conception due to potential risks to the fetus. Biologic medicines are avoided during pregnancy when possible. When rheumatoid arthritis is active during pregnancy, steroid medications such as prednisone and prednisolone are often used to quiet the joint inflammation. These medicines do not adversely affect the fetus."
What is the prognosis for rheumatoid arthritis patients?,"   With early, aggressive treatment, the outlook for those affected by rheumatoid arthritis can be very good. The overall attitude regarding ability to control the disease has changed tremendously since the turn of the century. Doctors now strive to eradicate any signs of active disease while preventing flare-ups. The disease can be controlled and a cooperative effort by the doctor and patient can lead to optimal health. Rheumatoid arthritis causes disability and can increase mortality and decrease life expectancy to lead to an early death. Patients have a less favorable outlook when they have deformity, disability, ongoing uncontrolled joint inflammation, and/or rheumatoid disease affecting other organs of the body. Overall, rheumatoid arthritis tends to be potentially more damaging when rheumatoid factor or citrulline antibody is shown by blood testing. Life expectancy improves with earlier treatment and monitoring. Finally, minimizing emotional stress can help improve the overall health in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Support and extracurricular groups provide those with rheumatoid arthritis time to discuss their problems with others and learn more about their illness."
What are tips for living with rheumatoid arthritis?," Early and aggressive treatment tends to result in optimal outcome. Understand how your rheumatoid arthritis, as well as the effects and side effects of its treatment, will be monitored. Maintain a working relationship with your treating doctor. Consider consulting with a rheumatologist. Have a game plan for addressing flare-ups of the rheumatoid inflammation. Preplan your treatment options for travel with your doctor. Review with your doctor any concerns about your rheumatoid arthritis, its influence on your lifestyle activities, your avocations, and your long-term life goals."
What specialists treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?," The primary specialist for diagnosing, managing, and monitoring rheumatoid arthritis is a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist works together with the primary doctor and other specialists to maximize health outcomes and minimize comorbid health conditions. Other specialists involved in the care of RA patients include the following:physiatristsdermatologistspulmonologistscardiologistsnephrologistsradiologistsneurologistsendocrinologistsorthopedistsgeneral surgeons physiatrists dermatologists pulmonologists cardiologists nephrologists radiologists neurologists endocrinologists orthopedists general surgeons Ancillary health care providers who can be involved in the care of patients with rheumatoid arthritis include physical therapists, occupational therapists, and massage therapists."
Is there a cure for RA?,"'No, rheumatoid arthritis is not a curable disease at this time. As the science of genetics and disease as well as autoimmunity evolve, it is very likely that cures for rheumatoid arthritis will become available.' "
Is it possible to prevent rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Currently, there is no specific ''prevention'' of rheumatoid arthritis. Because ''cigarette smoking'', exposure to silica mineral, and chronic periodontal disease all increase the risk for rheumatoid arthritis, these conditions should be avoided.' "
Are there support groups for people with rheumatoid arthritis?,"'There are support groups for rheumatoid arthritis in all major cities in the United States. Many are affiliated with local hospitals and/or local chapters of the Arthritis Foundation.''The Arthritis Foundation''P.O. Box 19000''Atlanta, Georgia 30326' "
Where can people get additional information on rheumatoid arthritis?,"'From the 2015 national meeting of the American College of Rheumatology:''For more information about rheumatoid arthritis as well as living with RA and for support groups, please consider the following:''Box AMS''Bethesda, Maryland 20892''301-495-4484' There are many new biologic treatments for rheumatoid arthritis on the near horizon. Many of these are being studied with and without simultaneous methotrexate. Some block chemical messengers and some block specific cell types of inflammation. The significant benefit of treating lipid/cholesterol profiles in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to improve long-term risks of stroke and heart attack was emphasized. Diets higher in fish, grains, and vegetables decrease the risk of developing RA. The Western diet, defined as including more processed meats, increases the risk. It is not certain whether this is because of a direct anti-inflammatory effect of the fish, grains, and vegetables or because of changes in the natural bacteria in the gut.

What research is being done on rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Scientists throughout the world are studying many promising areas of new treatment approaches for rheumatoid arthritis. Indeed, treatment guidelines are evolving with the availability of newer treatments. These areas include treatments that block the action of the special inflammation factors, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha), B-cell and T-cell function, as well as interleukin-1 (IL-1). Many other drugs are being developed that act against certain critical white blood cells and chemical messengers involved in rheumatoid inflammation. Also, new NSAIDs with mechanisms of action that are different from current drugs are on the horizon. Further biosimilar versions of the biologic medicines, including rituximab, are under study.''Better methods of more accurately defining which patients are more likely to develop more aggressive disease are becoming available. Recent antibody research found that the presence of citrulline antibodies in the blood is associated with a greater tendency toward more destructive RA forms.''Studies involving various types of the connective tissue collagen are in progress and show encouraging signs of reducing rheumatoid disease activity. Finally, genetic research and engineering are likely to bring forth many new avenues for earlier diagnosis and accurate treatment in the near future. Gene profiling, also known as gene array analysis, is being identified as a helpful method of defining which people will respond to which medicines. Studies are under way that are using gene array analysis to determine which patients will be at more risk for more aggressive disease. This is all occurring because of improvements in technology. We are at the threshold of tremendous improvements in the management of rheumatoid arthritis.' "
What is rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' (''RA'') is a chronic inflammatory disorder that typically affects the joints and other body parts, such as the skin, eyes, ''lungs'', ''heart'' and blood vessels.''RA'' is an autoimmune disorder, a condition where the body’s immune system attacks its own tissues.''Osteoarthritis'' occurs as a result of wear and tear of the joints. ''RA'' affects the lining of the joints, leading to inflammation, ''pain'' and swelling that eventually cause bone erosion and joint deformities. ''RA'' causes inflammation and damage in other parts of the body as well. Although new types of medications have improved treatment options dramatically, severe RA can still cause physical disabilities.' "
How serious is rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' (RA) is a chronic disease where patients suffer from frequent flare-ups of signs and symptoms and periods of remission (asymptomatic periods). Initially, the small joints are affected, especially the joints of the fingers and toes. As the disease progresses, other joints may be affected, like the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. RA also presents with systemic signs and symptoms and other body systems may be affected in 40% of cases. If not diagnosed early and appropriately treated, RA can lead to permanent deformities, disabilities and serious systemic complications.''Signs and ''symptoms of RA'' in the joints include''Systemic signs and symptoms''Complications of RA' Tender, warm and swollen joints Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity Loss of joint function Joint deformities Fatigue Fever  Loss of appetite Weight loss Blue fingertips due to vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) Ulcers Muscle wasting  Anemia  Scleritis: Inflammation of the sclera of the eyes. Pericarditis: Inflammation of the outer covering of the heart. Myocarditis: Inflammation of the heart. Inflammation of the nerves Osteoporosis: Weakening of the bones, making them more prone to fractures. Rheumatoid nodules: Firm bumps of tissue around the pressure points of joints, lungs, etc. Sjögren's syndrome: A disorder that causes dryness in the eyes and mouth. Infections: Systemic infections can occur because of the disease or medications. Weight gain can occur. Carpal tunnel syndrome: Inflammation can compress the median nerve that runs from the forearm into the hand and fingers. Cardiac (heart) complications: Pericarditis (inflammation of the outer covering of the heart) and myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) can occur. Lung complications: Scarring of the lungs (fibrosis) causing breathing difficulty. Lymphoma: RA increases the risk of lymphoma (blood cancers that develop in the lymph system)."
What are the causes of rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' (RA) is an autoimmune disorder. Certain factors increase the risk of RA. The common risk factors are' Sex: Women are at  an increased risk compared to men. Age: RA most commonly begins during middle age. Family history: A positive family history increases the risk of the disease. Smoking and other environmental exposures to asbestos or silica increase disease risk.  Obesity: Excess weight, especially in women younger than55, increases disease risk."
How is rheumatoid arthritis treated?,"'There is no cure for ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (RA). It is a lifelong disease with multiple flare-ups and periods of remission (asymptomatic periods). There are various treatment options available to control the progression of the disease and prevent complications. Treatment usually involves a combination of more than one treatment modality. The treatment options are''Medications''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''):\xa0NSAIDs can relieve ''pain'' and reduce inflammation.''Physical therapy''Patients are usually referred for physical or occupational therapy to learn exercises for improving and maintaining joint flexibility and rehabilitation of joints.\xa0''Surgery''Surgical procedures may be performed to help restore joint function and anatomy and reduce pain.\xa0' Steroids: Corticosteroid medications suppress the immune system. They reduce inflammation and pain and delay joint damage.  Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): These drugs are effective in the treatment of RA. They suppress inflammation and relieve symptoms. They can slow the progression and prevent joint deformities and systemic complications. Some commonly prescribed DMARDs are methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and leflunomide (Arava). Biological modifiers: These are a newer generation of DMARDs and they are usually taken with DMARDs. They suppress inflammation. Some commonly used biological agents are infliximab, rituximab, sarilumab, etc."
What is rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' (''RA'') is a type of inflammatory ''arthritis'' and autoimmune disease.' RA disease is characterized by chronic joint inflammation. Rheumatoid arthritis in the knee, hands, fingers, and feet is common. RA may also be called rheumatoid disease because at times rheumatoid arthritis causes systemic illness that impacts many organs of the body. Chronic inflammation of RA can cause permanent joint destruction and deformity."
What are early signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)?,"'While early signs and ''symptoms of RA'' can be mimicked by other diseases, the warning signs and symptoms are very characteristic of ''rheumatoid disease''. The 16 early ''RA symptoms'' and signs discussed in this article include the following:'   Fatigue Joint pain Joint tenderness Joint swelling Joint redness Joint warmth Joint stiffness Loss of joint range of motion Many joints affected (polyarthritis) Limping Joint deformity Both sides of the body affected (symmetric) Loss of joint function Anemia Fever Depression"
Fatigue,"'Fatigue'' is a very common symptom in all stages of ''rheumatoid arthritis'', particularly when the ''joint inflammation'' is active. ''Fatigue'' in ''rheumatoid arthritis'"" can be caused by the body's reaction to inflammation, poor ""'sleep'', ''anemia'', and medications.''The ''fatigue'' of ''rheumatoid arthritis'' that results in ''lack of energy'' can adversely affect emotions and mood, occupation, relationships with people, sex drive, productivity, attentiveness, creativity, and ''happiness''. ''Fatigue'' from ''rheumatoid arthritis'' can also be associated with other symptoms and signs, such as ''poor appetite'' and ''weight loss''.' "
Joint pain,"'Joint pain'' from ''rheumatoid arthritis'' is caused by the inflammation present in a joint when the disease is active. Joint ''pain'' can also occur when the disease is inactive or controlled if the joint has been damaged by rheumatoid ''arthritis'' in the past.''Active rheumatoid arthritis flare-ups cause the joint to swell because of both thickening of the joint lining tissue (synovium) and because of excess joint fluid. The swollen, inflamed joint stretches and irritates the capsule that surrounds the joint. The joint capsule has nerves endings within it that immediately send ''pain'' signals to the brain.''Past rheumatoid arthritis can lead to permanent joint destruction with damaged cartilage, bone, and ligaments. When the damaged joint is used, it can cause intense pain.' "
Joint tenderness,"'Rheumatoid arthritis characteristically leads to tenderness of involved joints. This is because the inflamed joint lining tissue has irritated the nerves in the joint capsule. When the irritated joint capsule is compressed by external pressure, such as from touching the joint, it is frequently tender. The pain elicited from compression is immediate. This is one of the reasons that rheumatoid arthritis can lead to difficulty sleeping and ''insomnia''.' "
Joint swelling,"'Swollen joints'' are very common in rheumatoid arthritis. Sometimes the ''joint swelling'' is minimal and can be difficult to appreciate. Other times the joint swelling is very apparent. Generally, people who are affected by rheumatoid arthritis can easily tell when their joints are swollen. The joint swelling can lead to loss of range of motion of the joint. Joint swelling in the fingers can make it hard to get rings off and on easily.' "
Joint redness,'Redness occurs over joints when they are inflamed. The redness in the skin over an inflamed joint from rheumatoid arthritis occurs because the capillaries of that skin are widened by the adjacent inflammation. These widened capillaries are referred to as dilated capillaries. ''Joint redness'' does not occur in all inflamed joints from rheumatoid arthritis. Sometimes the inflammation in the joint is inadequate to cause the capillaries in the skin to dilate.' 
Joint warmth,"'Warmth of the joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis is a sign of active inflammation. Doctors look for ''joint warmth'' as they monitor the activity of the disease. As rheumatoid arthritis responds to treatment, joint warmth resolves. Sometimes joint warmth is present without visible joint swelling or redness.' "
Joint stiffness,"'Stiffness'' is a typical rheumatoid arthritis symptom. Joints that are affected by active rheumatoid arthritis are inflamed and characteristically stiffer in the morning than later in the day. Doctors use the duration of the morning ''stiffness'' as a measure of the severity of the active joint inflammation. As rheumatoid arthritis responds to treatment, the duration of the morning ''joint stiffness'' diminishes.' "
Joint deformity,'Joint deformity can occur from chronic rheumatoid arthritis. Deformity in rheumatoid arthritis occurs because the unchecked inflammation leads to\xa0erosions of cartilage and bone as well as ligament loosening (laxity). Early diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is critical to prevent permanent joint damage and joint deformity.' 
Loss of joint range of motion,"'As the joints of rheumatoid arthritis become more inflamed with active disease, they tend to have incomplete range of motion. The range of motion is limited by the swelling within the joint. This is typically associated with ''weakness'' in the involved areas.''Joints affected by longstanding rheumatoid arthritis commonly lose range of motion permanently.' "
Many joints affected (polyarthritis),"'Usually, but not always, rheumatoid arthritis affects many joints. Classically, ''RA'' affects the small joints of the hands and wrists and balls of the ''feet''. Also, not uncommonly, knees, elbows, hips, ankles, and shoulders can be inflamed.''Sometimes, only a few joints are involved. Less frequently, a singular joint is involved. Both of these scenarios are more common in childhood inflammatory arthritis (''juvenile rheumatoid arthritis'').''When four or more joints are inflamed, the condition is referred to as polyarthritis. When only a few joints are inflamed, it is referred to as oligoarthritis. When a single joint is inflamed, it is referred to as monoarthritis.' "
Limping,"'Limping'' from poor lower extremity function can be caused by many diseases of the nerves, muscles, and bones of the lower extremities. Limping frequently occurs when rheumatoid arthritis affects the hips, knees, ankles, or feet. Pain, loss of range of motion, and joint swelling all can cause a person with rheumatoid arthritis to have a noticeable limp. It is not unusual for a young child with rheumatoid arthritis to have a painless limp as the first sign of the rheumatoid disease.' "
Both sides of the body affected (symmetric),"'Typically, the distribution of the joints involved in a person with rheumatoid arthritis is similar on both sides of the body. This symmetric joint involvement is a feature of classic rheumatoid arthritis. This does not mean that joint involvement is always symmetric, but it is common.''Rheumatoid arthritis usually (not always) involves many joints on both sides of the body. It is, therefore, sometimes referred to as a symmetric polyarticular form of arthritis. Accordingly, the small joints of the hands, wrists, and feet are commonly affected. The knees, ankles, shoulders, hips, and elbows can also be involved in early disease. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by inflammation in these joints. Early manifestations of this inflammation can be gradual or rapidly intense. The joint inflammation causes stiffness, usually worse in the morning or after being sedentary. It also causes warmth, swelling, redness, and pain in varying degrees. The joint can be very subtly affected with slight swelling or markedly affected with substantial loss of range of motion. The pain level can be completely disabling and does not always correlate with the degree of apparent inflammation.''As described above, the manner that each of the symptoms affects an individual can be very different from individual to individual and can vary during the day. The intensity and effect of each of the symptoms is dependent upon the ''RA'"" patient's age, activity, the medications he or she takes, as well as any additional medical conditions that are present."" "
Loss of joint function,"'Because rheumatoid arthritis leads to pain, swelling, and tenderness of the involved joints, there is loss of joint function. The swelling and sensitivity impedes the full motion and stability of the joint and it becomes incapable of carrying the movement with confidence, balance, and completeness. This loss of joint function leads to limping, lack of coordination, loss of grip and dexterity, and disability.' "
Anemia,'The chronic inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis commonly causes the bone marrow to decrease the release of ''red blood cells'' into the circulation. This lowers the red blood count to cause ''anemia'' when rheumatoid arthritis is active. It is not unusual for the ''anemia'' of rheumatoid arthritis to spontaneously correct as the inflammation of the disease is quieted by treatment.' 
Fever,"'Fever'', while not common in rheumatoid arthritis, does occur in some patients when the disease is actively causing inflammation. Typically, there is only mild low-grade temperature elevation and this corrects rapidly as the inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis is treated. Because patients with rheumatoid arthritis frequently require medications that can decrease the normal immune response, it is important that when they develop ''fever'', infection is considered as a possible cause. Infections can require aggressive treatment and interruption of some underlying rheumatoid treatments.' "
Depression,"'Because rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic condition potentially associated with pain and disability, it can lead to ''depression''. A person with rheumatoid arthritis can commonly feel frustrated, but it can also lead to real ''depression'' with sadness, hopelessness, and blue mood that goes beyond frustration. Doctors refer to this form of mood change as ""reactive ''depression''"" because it is a person\'s response to a particular situation, in this case, a new chronic disease. When patients feel ''depressed'', regardless of cause, it is essential to share their feelings with their health care provider. Over time, this can lead to a much healthier understanding of their bodies and improvement and resolution of their depression.' "
What are the less common forms of rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis can begin in less common forms. For example, it can begin with involvement of only a single joint or a few joints. Sometimes, this can later evolve to the more common presentation of many joints on both sides of the body.''Rarely, the earliest symptom of rheumatoid disease is inflammation of a body area that does not even involve a joint. For example, the lining of the ''lungs'' (pleura) can become inflamed to cause ''pleurisy'' many months before the arthritis develops. ''Occasionally, only a few joints are involved and the doctor may suspect another type of inflammatory arthritis. (There are over 100 forms of arthritis!) Again, this can sometimes only later evolve to become the more typical symmetrical polyarthritis by including many joints on both sides of the body. ''The caveat is that by recognizing early symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis ''rheumatologists'' and their patients can address the disease early, thereby affording optimal outcomes for those affected.'

Rheumatoid arthritis vs. arthritis: What’s the difference?,"'Arthritis'' is a general term used to describe joint disease. ''Rheumatoid arthritis'' (''RA'') is a type of arthritis in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the joints, causing chronic inflammation.''Rheumatoid arthritis'' is an autoimmune disease that occurs when the body’s immune system attacks the joint linings (synovium) that produce fluid that lubricates the joints. This results in signs and symptoms of inflammation, swelling, and ''pain'' in and around the joints, and in some cases, a ''rash''. Over time, if left untreated, ''RA'' damages cartilage and bone and causes permanent joint deformity.''RA'' affects joints on both sides of the body, typically the hands, ''feet'', wrists, elbows, knees and ankles, although it can also affect other joints. It can also affect the cardiovascular or respiratory systems.''Different types of medications are used to treat ''RA'', including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''), ''corticosteroids'', disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and subsets of DMARDs (''biologics'' and JAK inhibitors). ''Rheumatoid arthritis'' is diagnosed with a physical exam and history, a blood test and sometimes xrays.''Other types of arthritis include:' Osteoarthritis – the most common type of arthritis, resulting from degeneration of cartilage Inflammatory arthritis – examples include rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis Infectious arthritis – an infection triggers joint inflammation Metabolic arthritis – a buildup or uric acid in the blood causes joint pain"
What are the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis vs. arthritis?,"'When the disease is active, ''RA symptoms'' and signs can include''Muscle and ''joint stiffness'' are usually most notable in the morning and after periods of inactivity. This is referred to as morning stiffness and post-sedentary stiffness. Arthritis is common during disease flares. Also during flares, joints frequently become warm, red, swollen, painful, and tender. This occurs because the lining tissue of the joint (synovium) becomes inflamed, resulting in the production of excessive joint fluid (synovial fluid). The synovium also thickens with inflammation (synovitis).''Rheumatoid arthritis usually inflames multiple joints and affects both sides of the body. In its most common form, therefore, it is referred to as a symmetric polyarthritis.''Occasionally, only one joint is inflamed. When only one joint is involved, the arthritis can mimic the joint inflammation caused by other forms of arthritis, such as ''gout'' or joint infection.''Chronic inflammation can cause damage to body tissues, including cartilage and bone. This leads to a loss of cartilage and erosion and ''weakness'' of the bones as well as the muscles, resulting in joint deformity, loss of range of motion, destruction, and loss of function.''Rarely, rheumatoid arthritis can even affect the joint that is responsible for the tightening of our vocal cords to change the tone of our voice, the cricoarytenoid joint. When this joint is inflamed, it can cause ''hoarseness'' of the voice.''Symptoms in children with rheumatoid arthritis include limping, irritability, crying, and poor appetite.''Symptoms of arthritis include pain and limited function of joints. Joint inflammation from arthritis is characterized by joint stiffness, swelling, redness, pain, and warmth.''Many of the forms of arthritis, because they are rheumatic diseases, can cause symptoms affecting various organs of the body that do not directly involve the joints. Therefore, symptoms in some patients with certain forms of arthritis can also include' fatigue, loss of energy, lack of appetite, low-grade fever, muscle and joint pain, joint redness, joint swelling, joint tenderness, joint warmth, joint deformity, rheumatoid nodules, stiffness, loss of joint range of motion, loss of joint function, and limping. People with active inflammation of joints from RA can also experience depression, anemia frustration, and social withdrawal. Early rheumatoid arthritis symptoms may be subtle. The small joints of both the hands and wrists are often involved. Early symptoms of RA can be pain and prolonged stiffness of joints, particularly in the morning. Symptoms in the hands with rheumatoid arthritis include difficulty with simple tasks of daily living, such as turning door knobs and opening jars. The small joints of the feet are also commonly involved, which can lead to painful walking, especially in the morning after arising from bed. Stiffness of the joint can lead to poor function. Tenderness of the inflamed joint can be present with or without pain. When large joints are involved, such as the knee, there can be loss of cartilage with limitation of motion from the joint damage. When arthritis affects the small joints in fingers, there can be bone growth and loss of hand grip and grip strength of the hand associated with stiffness. Arthritis of weight-bearing joints can lead to difficulty walking from poor joint function and arthritis pain. fever, gland swelling (swollen lymph nodes), weight loss, fatigue, feeling unwell, and even symptoms from abnormalities of organs such as the lungs, heart, or kidneys."
What causes rheumatoid arthritis vs. arthritis?,"'The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown. Even though infectious agents such as ''viruses'', bacteria, and fungi have long been suspected, none has been proven as the cause. The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is a very active area of worldwide research.''It is believed that the tendency to develop rheumatoid arthritis may be genetically ''inherited'"" (hereditary). Certain genes have been identified that increase the risk for rheumatoid arthritis. It is also suspected that certain infections or factors in the environment might trigger the activation of the immune system in susceptible individuals. This misdirected immune system then attacks the body's own tissues. This leads to inflammation in the joints and sometimes in various organs of the body, such as the lungs or eyes.""'No one knows what triggers the onset of rheumatoid arthritis. Regardless of the exact trigger, the result is an immune system that is geared up to promote inflammation in the joints and occasionally other tissues of the body. Immune cells, called lymphocytes, are activated and chemical messengers (cytokines, such as ''tumor'' necrosis factor/TNF, interleukin-1/IL-1, and interleukin-6/IL-6) are expressed in the inflamed areas.''Environmental factors also seem to play some role in causing rheumatoid arthritis. For example, scientists have reported that ''smoking'' tobacco, exposure to silica mineral, and chronic periodontal disease all increase the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.''There are theories about gut bacteria (the microbiome of gut microbes that naturally exist in the lining of the bowels) that may trigger the onset of RA in genetically susceptible people. No specific microbes have been identified as definite causes.''The causes of arthritis depend on the form of arthritis. Causes include''Arthritis is classified as one of the rheumatic diseases. These are conditions that are different individual illnesses, with differing features, treatments, complications, and prognoses. They are similar in that they have a tendency to affect the joints, muscles, ligaments, cartilage, and tendons, and many have the potential to affect other internal body areas.''The major risk factors for most forms of arthritis are inherited genetic predispositions. ''Trauma''-related arthritis is related to the risk of injury from specific activities.' injury (leading to osteoarthritis), metabolic abnormalities (such as gout with elevated uric acid blood levels and pseudogout with hypercalcemia), hereditary factors, the direct and indirect effect of infections (bacterial and viral), and a misdirected immune system with autoimmunity (such as in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus)."
What is the treatment for rheumatoid arthritis vs. arthritis?,"'There is no known cure for rheumatoid arthritis.''To date, the goal of treatment in rheumatoid arthritis is to reduce joint inflammation and pain, maximize joint function, and prevent joint destruction and deformity.''The treatment of arthritis is dependent on the precise type of arthritis present. An accurate diagnosis increases the chances for successful treatment.''Treatments available include''Pain from osteoarthritis of the knee can be relieved by ''hyaluronic acid'' injections.''Rheumatoid arthritis can require medications that suppress the immune system (DMARDs mentioned earlier).''Low back arthritis that is irritating nerves of the spine can require surgical repair.''For more on treatments of particular forms of arthritis, see the corresponding articles for the form of arthritis of interest.' Early medical intervention has been shown to be important in improving outcomes. Aggressive management can improve function, stop damage to joints as monitored on X-rays, and prevent work disability. Optimal RA treatment involves a combination of medicines, rest, joint-strengthening exercises, joint protection, and patient (and family) education. Treatment is customized according to many factors such as disease activity, types of joints involved, general health, age, and patient occupation. RA treatment is most successful when there is close cooperation between the doctor, patient, and family members. RA medications include NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and corticosteroids for pain and inflammation symptoms. Drugs that affect the progression of rheumatoid arthritis are called DMARDs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) These ""second-line"" or ""slow-acting"" medicines may take weeks to months to become effective. They are used for long periods, even years, at varying doses. If maximally effective, DMARDs can promote remission, thereby retarding the progression of joint destruction and deformity. physical therapy, home remedies, splinting, cold-pack application, paraffin wax dips, anti-inflammatory drugs, pain medications (ranging from pain-relieving over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen [Tylenol] and ibuprofen [Motrin, Advil] to narcotics), immune-altering medications, biologic medications, and surgical operations (including joint replacement surgery)."
What is the prognosis for rheumatioid arthritis vs. arthritis?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis is not a curable disease at this time. As the science of genetics and disease as well as autoimmunity evolve, it is very likely that cures for rheumatoid arthritis will become available.''The outlook for patients with arthritis depends on its severity, complications, and whether or not there are non-joint manifestations of the disease. For example, rheumatoid arthritis can affect the lungs, kidneys, eyes, etc. Chronic joint inflammation can lead to permanent damage to the joint and loss of joint function, making movement difficult or impossible.' Early and aggressive treatment tends to result in optimal outcome. Understand how your rheumatoid arthritis, as well as the effects and side effects of its treatment, will be monitored. Maintain a working relationship with your treating doctor. Consider consulting with a rheumatologist. Have a game plan for addressing flare-ups of the rheumatoid inflammation. Preplan your treatment options for travel with your doctor. Review with your doctor any concerns about your rheumatoid arthritis, its influence on your lifestyle activities, your avocations, and your long-term life goals."
What is rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' (''RA'"") is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the joints. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are mistakenly attacked by their own immune system by an abnormal, misdirected immune system response. Inflammation of the joints and tissue around the joints are characteristic features of ""'rheumatoid arthritis'' that are caused by the autoimmune process. Because it can affect multiple other organs of the body, ''RA'' is referred to as a systemic illness (in fact, sometimes it is referred to as ''rheumatoid disease'').' "
What is fibromyalgia?,"'Fibromyalgia'' syndrome is a ''chronic pain'' condition that affects 4% of people in the United States. Many patients experience ''pain'' all over their body. ''Sleep'' that is not restful is another hallmark of ''fibromyalgia'', causing ''chronic fatigue'"". While patients with fibromyalgia may feel as though their joints, muscles, tendons, and tissues are inflamed, measurable levels of inflammation in blood testing are normal. Fibromyalgia can be very painful and greatly affect a patient's quality of life in many ways, but it does not cause damage to organs or joints."" "
What are signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia?,"'The defining feature of ''rheumatoid arthritis symptoms'' are\xa0\xa0''The defining features of fibromyalgia are\xa0''fatigue'' with widespread ''pain'' and tenderness. Patients with fibromyalgia may have many other symptoms as well, including'   joint inflammation, which causes joint pain, swelling, and redness. The swelling is present for more than six weeks and is usually on both sides of the body in the same joint (for example in both wrists). brain fog (fibro fog), tingling or numbness in the feet or hands that comes and goes, anxiety, depression, bowel irritability, and many others."
What are home remedies and treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia?," The treatment of fibromyalgia always involves getting enough sleep, exercising, and stress reduction. Medications can be used to treat fibromyalgia pain as well as improve sleep. Getting enough sleep, exercising, and stress reduction are also very important in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, medications are necessary to reduce joint inflammation and prevent joint damage. Without treatment, RA grows progressively worse and damages joints. There are many medications that have been proven to slow or stop the course of rheumatoid arthritis."
What are causes and risk factors of rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia?,"'The causes of rheumatoid ''arthritis'' are partially genetic and partially environmental. Certain genes predispose people to developing ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and that is why it runs strongly in some families. Environmental risk factors for ''RA'' include ''cigarette smoking'' and female sex.''Fibromyalgia is in part genetic and can be triggered by stressful events. The stressful event can be physical, such as a car accident, or emotional. The ''chronic pain'' of autoimmune diseases such as ''RA'' and ''systemic lupus erythematosus'' can sometimes trigger fibromyalgia.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to make a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' is diagnosed based on persistent joint inflammation for more than 6 weeks. Blood tests are commonly abnormal in rheumatoid ''arthritis'', including the erythrocyte ''sedimentation rate'' (ESR) inflammation level, and ''rheumatoid factor'' (RF), and ''citrulline antibody'' (anti-CCP antibody).''The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is made based on symptoms of chronic widespread pain and ''fatigue'' and signs of widespread tenderness. Many people have both rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia, but fibromyalgia does not cause rheumatoid arthritis or progress into it.'  "
What is the prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia?,"'The prognosis of fibromyalgia is very good, in that people with fibromyalgia do not suffer damage to their joints, muscles, or organs. However, fibromyalgia pain is chronic and improves with lifestyle changes and medications to a manageable level.''There have been tremendous advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the past decade, and many medications are now available to stop or slow the disease. Currently, the goal of treatment is low disease activity or disease remission, where patients have few or no swollen and tender joints and low systemic inflammation blood levels.' "
Is it possible to prevent rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia?,"'There is no known ''prevention'' of rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia. Living a healthy lifestyle, eating healthy foods (including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean meats), getting plenty of sleep, not drinking excessive ''alcohol'', not ''smoking'' tobacco, and not using ''drugs'' may help the body function at its best.' "
What are rheumatoid arthritis and lupus?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' (''RA'') and ''lupus'' are two varieties of autoimmune diseases. This means they are caused when the body’s immune system attacks its own tissue by mistaking it for a foreign body.\xa0''Being autoimmune diseases, ''RA'' and ''lupus'' share a few similarities, but they also differ in many aspects. While ''RA'' attacks the immune system on the joints, ''lupus'' involves many other parts of the body besides the joints.''Like several other autoimmune diseases, both ''RA'' and ''lupus'' are more common in women than in men. Women are two to three times more likely to have RA than men. In the case of lupus, the odds are still higher, with women being up to nine times more likely to get lupus than men.' "
Are the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis different from lupus?,"'The ''symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis'' (RA) are mainly limited to the joints, particularly the small joints in the toes, fingers, hands, and ''feet''. Although less common, RA may involve the wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, and other body parts. Joint involvement in RA is symmetric, which means that if the joints in the fingers of your left hand have ''pain'', you will experience ''pain'' in the fingers of your right hand too. The common ''symptoms of RA'' are as follows:''The symptoms of RA do not remain the same all the time; they may exacerbate (flare-ups) and resolve (remissions) from time to time.''Lupus also shows remissions and flare-ups like RA. The ''symptoms of lupus'', however, are not just restricted to the joints. Most patients with lupus experience ''fatigue'' (exhaustion) as their first complaint. ''Joint pain'' and ''fever'' may be the reason that many patients with lupus visit their doctor. ''Lupus symptoms'' include the following:' Warm, swollen, and painful joints Morning stiffness in the joints or stiffness after inactivity Joint deformity Fever Fatigue Loss of appetite Loss of weight Dryness in eyes Dry mouth Abnormal colored urine or no urine due to kidney impairment Numbness and tingling in the hands and feet Difficulty in breathing Pale skin Chest pain or pressure Malar rash (butterfly-shaped rash involving the cheeks and bridge of the nose) Fever  Joint pain in the absence of joint deformity Sun sensitivity Pale or anemic look  Swelling  Dry and itchy eyes Dry mouth Fingers and joints turning pale or bluish on exposure to stress and cold Difficulty in breathing Chest pain Seizures  Increased tendency for bleeding Mental changes Cough Nausea and vomiting Abdominal pain Indigestion Weight loss Nerve pain Weakness Headache Memory impairment Frequent miscarriages"
How are rheumatoid arthritis and lupus diagnosed?,"'Rheumatoid arthritis'' (RA) and lupus share their symptoms with other diseases and need a thorough examination by your doctor for a diagnosis.\xa0''The diagnosis of lupus is quite difficult because the signs and symptoms of this disease are quite varied and may involve any part of the body.' History and physical examination: Your doctor will ask about your complaints in detail and other relevant information, such as a family history of any diseases or any medications you are on. Your doctor will examine you for any joint swelling, redness, warmth, and deformity. They may also check your muscle reflexes and examine whether other body parts show disease involvement. Blood tests: Your doctor may get your blood tested for various disease markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and rheumatoid factor. Imaging tests: Your doctor may request imaging tests such as X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). History and physical examination: Your doctor will ask about your complaints in detail and other relevant information, such as a family history of lupus, any other chronic conditions, and any medications you are on. They will examine you physically to look for the involvement of different body parts in the disease. Lab tests: Your doctor may recommend lab tests for various disease markers, such as blood counts, ESR, liver and kidney function tests, antinuclear antibody test (ANA), and urine analysis. Imaging: Your doctor may recommend imaging studies to determine how much your organs are affected by lupus. These include X-ray, MRI, and echocardiography. Biopsy: To determine the extent of kidney involvement, your doctor may take a small piece of the kidney tissue (biopsy) through a needle or small surgical cut and send it for lab examination. Biopsy of the skin may also be taken when lupus involves the skin."
Facts you should know about rheumatoid factor (RF)," Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that is detectable in the blood of approximately 80% of adults with rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor test is used by health care professionals to help in diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis. Sometimes rheumatoid factor can be detected in the blood of normal individuals and of those with other autoimmune diseases that are not rheumatoid arthritis. In people with rheumatoid arthritis, high levels of rheumatoid factor can indicate a tendency toward more aggressive disease and/or a tendency to develop rheumatoid nodules and/or rheumatoid lung disease."
What is rheumatoid factor?,"'Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that is measurable in the blood with a routine blood test. Rheumatoid factor is actually an antibody that can bind to other antibodies. Antibodies are normal proteins in our blood that are important parts of our immune system. Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that is not usually present in the normal individual. Because rheumatoid factor antibody binds to normal antibodies, it can be generally referred to as an autoantibody. Health care professionals use the rheumatoid factor test to assist in the diagnosis of rheumatoid ''arthritis''.''Rheumatoid factor is sometimes abbreviated as ""RF.""'  "
What is the rheumatoid factor test for?,"'Most commonly, rheumatoid factor is used as a blood test for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid factor is present in about 80% of adults (but a much lower proportion of children) with rheumatoid arthritis.' "
What are the normal ranges for rheumatoid factor?,"'The ""normal"" range (or negative test result) for rheumatoid factor is less than 14 IU/ml. Any result with values 14 IU/ml or above is considered abnormally high, elevated, or positive.' "
What do high rheumatoid levels mean?,"'High levels of rheumatoid factor (rheumatoid factor ""positive"") are associated with a tendency toward more severe ''rheumatoid disease''. This factor is also associated with a higher tendency to develop non-joint manifestations of rheumatoid disease, such as rheumatoid nodules and rheumatoid lung disease.' "
Can you have high rheumatoid blood levels if you don't have rheumatoid arthritis?,"'Yes. Rheumatoid factor is also present in patients with other conditions, including other connective tissue diseases (such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'"" and Sjögren's syndrome), some infectious diseases (such as infectious ""'hepatitis'', ''syphilis'', ''infectious mononucleosis'', parasites, and ''tuberculosis''), ''liver disease'', and ''sarcoidosis'"". Rheumatoid factor can also sometimes be present in normal individuals without diseases. This occurs more frequently in people with family members who have rheumatoid arthritis. So precise interpretation of rheumatoid factors requires a complete knowledge of the patient's history and medical status."" "
What is rheumatology?,"'Rheumatology'' is the field of medicine that is concerned with the evaluation and treatment of people with autoimmune conditions and joint diseases, including ''arthritis''. Branches of rheumatology include basic research and clinical research, as well as clinical diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of patients with these illnesses.' "
What is a rheumatologist?,"'A ''rheumatologist'' is a subspecialist in the nonsurgical treatment of rheumatic illnesses, including autoimmune diseases and especially the many forms of arthritis and joint disease.' "
What training does a rheumatologist receive?,"'Classical adult rheumatology training includes four years of medical school, one year of internship in internal medicine, two years of internal medicine residency, and two years of rheumatology fellowship training. There is a subspecialty board for rheumatology certification, offered by the American Board of Internal Medicine, which can provide board certification to approved rheumatologists.''Pediatric rheumatologists are physicians who specialize in providing comprehensive care to children (as well as their families) with rheumatic diseases, including autoimmune diseases, and particularly arthritis. Pediatric rheumatologists are pediatricians who have completed an additional two to three years of specialized training in pediatric rheumatology and are usually board certified in pediatric rheumatology.' "
What diseases and conditions do rheumatologists treat?,"'Rheumatologists have special interests in unexplained ''rash'', ''fever'', arthritis, ''anemia'', ''weakness'', ''weight loss'', ''fatigue'', joint or ''muscle pain'', autoimmune disease, and ''anorexia''. They often serve as consultants, acting like medical detectives for other doctors.''Rheumatologists have particular skills in the evaluation of the over 100 forms of arthritis and have special interest in ''rheumatoid arthritis'', spondylitis, ''psoriatic arthritis'', ''systemic lupus erythematosus'', ''antiphospholipid antibody syndrome'', '""Still's disease""', ''dermatomyositis'', '""Sjögren's syndrome""', ''vasculitis'', ''scleroderma'', ''mixed connective tissue disease'', ''sarcoidosis'', ''Lyme disease'', ''osteomyelitis'', ''osteoarthritis'', ''back pain'', ''gout'', ''pseudogout'', relapsing ''polychondritis'', ''Henoch-Schönlein purpura'', ''serum sickness'', ''reactive arthritis'', ''Kawasaki disease'', erythromelalgia, '""Raynaud's disease""', growing pains, ''iritis'', ''osteoporosis'', ''reflex sympathetic dystrophy'', as well as soft tissue rheumatism (such as tendinitis, muscle ''pain'', and ''fibromyalgia''), and others.' "
How should patients prepare for their rheumatology visit?,"'Be prepared for questions about your health history for your visit with the rheumatologist. They will want to know about the history of your main complaint, including how long the symptoms and signs have been occurring, what situations or actions make the symptoms and signs better or worse, how intense the symptoms and signs are, what functions are impaired by the symptoms and signs, ''stiffness'', ''pain'', ''swelling'', ''warmth'', tenderness, ''fever'', ''chills'', ''weight loss'' or gain, sweats, ''tremor'', tingling, numbness, ''breathing'' impairments, ''palpitations'', and more. They will need to know what particular home remedies, medications, and therapies you have already tried and how they affected you. They will want to know your family history and past medical history, as well as underlying medical diseases and conditions. They also will need to know the names of each of your treating doctors. Bring all of your past testing results with you.' "
What can patients expect during a visit with a rheumatologist?,"'After your medical history is reviewed with the doctor, be prepared to have a thorough examination. You may still require further blood testing, ''X-rays'', scans, or even additional surgical and/or medical consultants and rheumatology follow-up visits to get to a proper diagnosis and optimal treatment plan.''It can be helpful to bring a family member along. Because many rheumatic conditions can be complex medically, may require serious medicines that can have side effects and need monitoring testing, and because the conditions can affect the day-to-day functioning of the patient in the family environment, doctors will generally welcome the presence of the family member. By being present when the condition is explained, the required tests are described, and the treatment options and side effects are reviewed, the family member can assist the patient in understanding the game plan while they are permitted their own optimal understanding of the situation that will be confronting the family.' "
What is rhinoplasty?,"'Rhinoplasty is a facial cosmetic procedure, usually performed to enhance the appearance or reconstruct the nose. During rhinoplasty, the nasal cartilages and bones are modified, or tissue is added, to improve the visual appeal of the nose. Rhinoplasty is also frequently performed to repair nasal ''fractures''. When rhinoplasty is used to repair nasal fractures, the goal is to restore pre-injury appearance of the nose.  Septorhinoplasty is a related procedure performed for patients who also have nasal obstruction. Septorhinoplasty not only improves the appearance of the nose, but it removes any internal obstructions and stabilizes structures that may be blocking nasal ''breathing''.'  "
Initial evaluation for rhinoplasty,"""Cosmetic concerns and expectations should be fully discussed prior to surgery. The surgeon's recommendations and any particular limitations set forth by the structure of your nose, face, and skin are important to understand and have explained. Photographs (without make-up) are usually obtained before surgery to help with preoperative planning and after surgery to document postoperative results."" "
What happens before rhinoplasty surgery?,"'In most situations, the surgery is performed as an outpatient at either the hospital or the surgicenter. In both facilities, quality care can be provided without the expense and inconvenience of an overnight stay. An anesthesiologist is present for monitoring vital functions throughout the procedure. Usually, the anesthesiologist will call the night before surgery to review the medical history. Preoperative laboratory studies will need to be done several days in advance. Transportation after the procedure will need to be arranged and someone should stay with the patient during the first night.''Aspirin'', or any product containing aspirin, should not be taken within 10 days of the date of surgery. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''Advil'', ''Motrin'', ''Naprosyn'') should not be taken within 7 days of the date of surgery. Many ''over-the-counter products'' contain aspirin or Advil type ''drugs'' so it is important to check all medications carefully. If there is any question, please call the office or consult a pharmacist. ''Tylenol'' is an acceptable ''pain reliever''. Prescriptions for ''pain'' medications are usually written prior to the date of surgery and should be filled in advance.''\xa0No food or liquids should be consumed within 6 hours prior to the time of surgery. This includes even water, candy, or chewing gum. Anything in the stomach increases the chances of an anesthetic complication. ''Smokers'' should make every effort to stop ''smoking'', or at least reduce the number of cigarettes. This will help to reduce postoperative ''coughing'' and bleeding. Difficulty with tissue healing has also been noted in smokers during the postoperative period.'""Any illness prior to the day of surgery should be reported to the surgeon's office as soon as possible. If illness occurs the day of surgery it is best to proceed to the surgical facility as planned and be evaluated to decide if surgery is safe."" "
What happens the day of Rhinoplasty Surgery?,"'It is important to check in with the surgical facility on time. Bring all papers and forms including any preoperative orders and history sheets. Wear comfortable loose fitting clothes that do not have to be pulled over the head. Leave all jewelry and valuables at home. Remove all make-up with a cleansing cream. Thoroughly wash the face with soap and water and do not apply ''makeup'' or creams.''Do not take any medication unless instructed to do so. Usually, a nurse will start an intravenous infusion line (IV) in the pre-operative holding room and a medication may be given for relaxation.' "
What happens during rhinoplasty surgery?,"'In the operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of a ''gas'' and an intravenous medication. Continuous monitoring during the procedure usually includes a pulse oximeter (oxygen saturation) and ''EKG'' (cardiac rhythm). The surgical team is prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room. Depending on what is required and what additional procedures are performed, the surgery may take one to several hours. The surgeon normally talks with any family or friends once the patient is safely in the recovery room.' "
What happens after rhinoplasty surgery?,"'Patients are monitored after surgery in the recovery room by a nurse. A patient is able to go home the same day as the surgery once fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes several hours. Transportation home will need to be arranged. A responsible adult should be in the same residence overnight for help on short notice.''At home the patient should have bed rest with the head elevated on 2-3 pillows. ''Edema'' and swelling are minimized by keeping the head elevated above the ''heart''. An assistant should be available for out of bed excursions to the bathroom. Straining should be avoided. If constipated, take a ''stool softener'' or a gentle ''laxative''.''Swelling and ''bruising'' of the nose, upper lip, cheeks, or around the eyes for several days after surgery is a normal occurrence. This will gradually go away over the next 7 to 10 days. Ice on the face, ''bridge'' of the nose, and eyes as much as tolerated will help to minimize these problems. This will also help with postoperative edema and ''pain''. Some patients have found frozen vegetables in packages (for example, ''bags'' of frozen peas) to be a convenient ice pack which conforms to the face.''A nasal splint or cast will cover the outside of the nose, and will usually be removed one week following surgery. As swelling subsides, the splint tends to fit less tightly. If the cast gets wet it may come off prematurely; this is usually not a problem and does not affect the outcome of the procedure.''Moderate bleeding from the nose is normal, and will gradually decrease. The gauze dressing (""mustache dressing"") will collect blood and should be changed only when saturated. It is not unusual to change these dressing every hour during the first 24 hours after surgery. This dressing will usually not be needed after a few days. Do not take aspirin, aspirin-containing medications, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as Advil) for 3 weeks following surgery.''''It is best to eat a light, soft, and cool ''diet'' as tolerated after recovery from the anesthetic. Avoid hot liquids for several days. It is best to go slowly with food immediately after the procedure to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and  ''vomiting''. Patients occasionally vomit one or two times immediately after surgery; if it persists, medication to settle the stomach may be prescribed. It is important to remember that a good overall ''diet'' with ample rest promotes healing.''Antibiotics are prescribed after surgery. It is important to finish all the pills that have been ordered. Some form of a narcotic will also be prescribed (usually ''vicodin'') which is to be taken as needed. If narcotics are taken, it is important not to drive or engage in activities where impaired judgment could cause injury. In some situations steroids may be prescribed to be taken either preoperatively and/or postoperatively. It is very important to take this medication as prescribed, and not discontinue it prematurely. An anti-emesis medication such as phenergan may be prescribed for ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'' postoperatively. Possible drug reactions to any of these medications, such as a ''rash'', should be reported to the doctor as soon as noticed. No other medications, either prescribed or over-the-counter, should be taken without the knowledge of your doctor.' "
What is the post-operative care for rhinoplasty?,"'In most situations, packs will have been placed in the nose to control postoperative bleeding. The packing material will be removed at a scheduled postoperative visit. Arrangements should be made for someone else to drive to and from the office for this first visit. Eat a light meal before this visit and avoid taking excessive pain medications. Immediately after the nasal packs are removed, a saline nasal spray such as ""Ocean Spray"" is used several times per day to prevent crusts from forming in the nose. Several subsequent office visits are necessary to assess healing, remove crusts, and ensure a speedy recovery. The nose is usually tender after surgery, so a spray of special numbing medication is used before removing crusts.''After the packing has been removed, breathing through the nose is acceptable, but do not blow or sneeze through it for 7-10 days. Any sneezes should be channeled through the open mouth. Expect some light blood-tinged drainage from the nose for several days. If bleeding becomes excessive, apply ice and rest quietly with head elevated while holding the nose. If bleeding continues, call the doctor.''Rest for the first week following surgery. Avoid excessive talking, smiling, hard chewing, strenuous activities, lifting heavy objects, bumping the nose, and bending over. Try not to rest glasses on the bridge of the nose until soreness and swelling subside. ''Contact lenses'' can be worn once eye swelling and any irritation have resolved. ''Alcohol'' and tobacco should be avoided because they may prolong swelling and healing. Smoke, dust, and fumes may irritate the nose and cause an infection. Facial tanning is discouraged for 6 months after surgery. Number 15 or greater sun block is recommended during any sun exposure. Make-up may be worn anytime after surgery.''Lubricate the nostrils, as instructed, with a Q-tip and Vaseline to soften harden crusts. Peroxide helps to loosen crusts. After several days a few of the absorbable ''sutures'' may become noticeable. Be gentle while brushing the upper ''teeth''. They will often be tender for several weeks, and there may some numbness of the ''teeth'' and palate for several months.''Exercise'' and ''swimming'' may be resumed after 3 weeks if there are no bleeding problems. Diving should be postponed for two months. It is advisable not to schedule travel for three weeks following surgery to allow for proper postoperative recovery and healing.' A sudden increase in the amount of bleeding from the nose unrelieved by pressure, ice, and head elevation. A fever greater than 101.5 degrees F which persists despite increasing the amount of fluid intake and Tylenol.

What are the risks and complications of rhinoplasty?,"'This surgery, like any surgery, may involve risks of unsuccessful results, complications, or injury from both known and unforeseen causes. Because individuals differ in their response to surgery, their anesthetic reactions, and their healing outcomes, ultimately there can be no guarantee made as to the results or potential complications.''The following complications have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. Although many of these complications are rare, all have occurred at one time or another in the hands of experienced surgeons practicing the standard of community care.' Nasal obstruction due to failure to straighten the septum or later re-deviation of the septum, collapse of the nasal cartilage, or the re-growth or swelling of the turbinates. Failure to resolve coexisting sinus infections, or recurrence of coexisting sinus problems and/or polyps, or the need for further or more aggressive surgery. In rare situations, bleeding can lead to a need for blood products or a blood transfusion. Autologous (self-donated) or designated donor blood may be arranged in advance in case an emergency transfusion is necessary. Chronic nasal drainage or excessive dryness or crusting of the nose or sinuses. Need for allergy evaluation, treatments, or environmental controls.

Failure to restore or worsening of the sense of smell or taste, or failure to relieve nosebleeds."
"What is ricin, and where does it come from?","  Castor beans are processed throughout the world to make castor oil. Ricin is part of the waste ""mash"" produced when castor oil is made. Ricin is a poison protein found naturally in castor beans from the castor bean plant (Ricinus communis). If castor beans are chewed and swallowed, the released ricin can cause injury. It can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid. It is a stable substance under normal conditions, but can be inactivated by heat above 80 degrees centigrade (176 degrees Fahrenheit)."
"How soon do poisoning symptoms start, and how long does death take?"," 

Read Doctor's View
   The major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received, though many organs may be affected in severe cases. Initial symptoms of poisoning by inhalation may occur as early as 4- 8 hours and as late as 24 hours after exposure. Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 10 hours. Inhalation: Within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known exposure to it, people having respiratory symptoms should seek medical care. Ingestion: If someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would likely develop vomiting and diarrhea that may become bloody. Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person's liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die. Skin and eye exposure: It is unlikely to be absorbed through normal skin. Contact with ricin powders or products may cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes. However, if you touch ricin that is on your skin and then eat food with your hands or put your hands in your mouth, you may ingest some. Ricin poisoning could kill a person within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received."
How much ricin is lethal?,"""Ricin works by getting inside the cells of a person's body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur."" Effects of this type of poisoning depend on whether it was inhaled, ingested, or injected. It is difficult to say exactly how much ricin could kill a person as it depends on the castor beans: their size, weight, moisture content, time of harvest, and other factors. The minimum number of castor beans associated with death was 2, but it symptoms of castor bean poisoning have been documented with as few as one half a bean, to up to 30 beans."
"How you could be exposed to ricin, and how deadly is it?"," It would take a deliberate act to make ricin and use it to poison people. Unintentional exposure to ricin is highly unlikely, except through the ingestion of castor beans. If made into a partially purified material or refined into a terrorist or warfare agent, ricin could be used to expose people through the air, food, or water. In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist who was living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an umbrella. The umbrella had been rigged to inject a poison ricin pellet under Markov's skin. In the 1940s the U.S. military experimented with using ricin as a possible warfare agent. In some reports ricin has possibly been used as a warfare agent in the 1980s in Iraq and more recently by terrorist organizations. Ricin poisoning is not contagious. Ricin-associated illness cannot be spread from person to person through casual contact. However, if you come into contact with someone who has ricin on their body or clothes, you could become exposed to it."
What is ricin used for?,"'Ricin is found in the byproducts of castor oil production. It is a protein. Unfortunately, it is used as a biological weapon and by assassins.'

In some reports it has possibly been used as a warfare agent in the 1980s in Iraq and more recently by terrorist organizations. In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist who was living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an umbrella. The umbrella had been rigged to inject a poison ricin pellet under Markov's skin. It has been used experimentally in medicine to kill cancer cells. Protein toxins such as ricin kill cells and if it can be properly targeted, the goal would be to use it to selectively kill cancer cells while normal cells are spared."
"Is there a treatment, antidote, or cure for ricin poisoning?"," Because there is no antidote exists for ricin, the most important factor is avoiding exposure to it in the first place. If exposure cannot be avoided, the most important factor is then getting the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible. Symptomatic poisoning is treated by giving victims supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poisoning. The types of supportive medical care would depend on several factors, such as the route by which victims were poisoned (that is, whether poisoning was by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or eye exposure). Care could include such measures as helping victims breathe, giving them intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle inserted into a vein), giving them medications to treat conditions such as seizure and low blood pressure, flushing their stomachs with activated charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested), or washing out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated."
What should I do if I've been exposed to ricin?,"   Exposure to this type of poisoning is not always fatal, and it's possible to survive. Get fresh air right away by leaving the area where the ricin was released.If it release was outside, move away from the area where it was released.If it release was indoors, get out of the building. If it release was outside, move away from the area where it was released. If it release was indoors, get out of the building. If you are near a release of ricin, emergency coordinators may tell you to either evacuate the area or to ""shelter in place"" inside a building to avoid being exposed to the chemical. If you think you may have been exposed to this type of poisoning, you should remove your clothing, rapidly wash your entire body with soap and water, and get medical care as quickly as possible. Removing your clothing:Quickly take off clothing that may have ricin on it. Any clothing that has to be pulled over the head should be cut off the body instead of pulled over the head.If you are helping other people remove their clothing, try to avoid touching any contaminated areas, and remove the clothing as quickly as possible.

How do authorities confirm cases of suspected ricin poisoning?," If authorities suspect that people have inhaled ricin, a potential clue would be that a large number of people who had been close to each other rapidly developed fever, cough, and excess fluid in their lungs. These symptoms would likely be followed by severe breathing problems and possibly death. If in suspected situations where the poison may have been disseminated, preliminary environmental testing by public health or law enforcement authorities detects ricin in powders or materials released into the immediate environment. Persons occupying such areas may initially be observed for signs of poisoning. CDC can assess selected specimens on a provisional basis for urinary ricinine, an alkaloid in the castor bean plant. Only urinary ricinine testing is available at CDC or the LRN."

What is rickets?,"'Rickets is a bone disorder caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. Rickets leads to softening and weakening of the bones and is seen most commonly in children 6-24 months of age. There are several subtypes of rickets, including hypophosphatemic rickets (vitamin-D-resistant rickets), renal or kidney rickets (''renal osteodystrophy''), and most commonly, nutritional rickets (caused by dietary deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate). Classic nutritional rickets is also medically termed osteomalacia.'  "
What is the history of rickets?,"'Roman descriptions of individuals with rickets can be found as early as the second century, and in the 1640s, the condition was well documented as a common bone ailment across England. Unfortunately, the scientifically proven cause of rickets was not identified until the 1920s, and by the 1930s, public-health initiatives recommended fortifying milk with vitamin D and cod-''liver'' oil as a nutritional supplement for young infants and children. This led to a near eradication of rickets in the United States and other industrialized nations. Unfortunately, rickets has made a comeback and is still common in less-developed nations. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, rickets is seen more frequently amongst infants and children living in industrialized nations, often among more affluent populations.' "
What are risk factors for the development of rickets?,"'Rickets risk factors include' premature birth (low levels of vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus); limited sun exposure (especially in high and low latitudes); hereditary metabolic diseases (for example, X-linked hypophosphotemic rickets); darkly pigmented individuals; infants born to vitamin D-deficient mothers; renal (kidney) diseases that affect calcium and phosphorus absorption; and nutrition -- suboptimal calcium and phosphorus intake or low vitamin D intake (seen in certain vegan diets due to avoidance of milk/dairy products). Soy milk and breakfast cereals fortified with vitamin D are helpful."
What causes rickets?,"'Regardless of the type of rickets, the cause is always either due to a deficiency of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. Three common causes of rickets include nutritional rickets, hypophosphatemic rickets, and renal rickets.''Nutritional rickets, also called osteomalacia, is a condition caused by ''vitamin D deficiency''. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is essential for the normal formation of bones and ''teeth'' and necessary for the appropriate absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the bowels. It occurs naturally in very small quantities in some foods such as saltwater fish (salmon, sardines, herring, and fish-liver oils). Vitamin D is also naturally synthesized by skin cells in response to sunlight exposure. It is necessary for the appropriate absorption of calcium from the gut.''Infants and children most at risk for developing nutritional rickets include dark-skinned infants, exclusively ''breastfed'' infants, and infants who are born to mothers who are vitamin D deficient. In addition, older children who are kept out of direct sunlight or who have vegan diets may also be at risk.''Hypophosphatemic rickets is caused by chronically low levels of phosphate in the blood. The bones become painfully soft and pliable. This is caused by a genetic dominant X-linked defect in the ability for the kidneys to control the amount of phosphate excreted in the urine. The individual affected is able to absorb phosphate and calcium from the gut, but the phosphate is lost through the kidneys into the urine. This is not caused by a ''vitamin D deficiency''. Patients with hypophosphatemic rickets typically have obvious symptoms by 1 year of age. Treatment is generally through nutritional ''supplements'' of phosphate and ''calcitriol'' (the activated form of vitamin D).''Similar to hypophosphatemic rickets, renal rickets is caused by a number of kidney disorders. Individuals suffering from ''kidney disease'' often have decreased ability to regulate the amounts of ''electrolytes'' lost in the urine. This includes calcium and phosphate, and therefore the affected individuals develop symptoms almost identical to severe nutritional rickets. Treatment of the underlying kidney problem and nutritional supplementation are recommended for these patients.'  "
What are rickets symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms of rickets include bone ''pain'' or tenderness, dental deformities, delayed formation of ''teeth'', decreased muscle strength, predisposition to infections, impaired growth, ''short stature'', and a number of skeletal deformities, including abnormally shaped skull (craniotabes), bowlegs, rib-cage abnormalities (rachitic rosary), and breastbone, pelvic, and spinal deformities.''Occasionally, in very severe rickets, patients may develop even more serious signs and symptoms associated with very low levels of calcium or phosphate. These might include tetany (involuntary muscle contractions) or ''seizures''. These are medical emergencies and require immediate treatment.'  "
Who are the specialists who treat rickets?,'Pediatricians and family practitioners usually care for children with nutritional rickets without consulting specialists. Kidney specialists (nephrologists) generally help manage renal rickets as well as hypophosphatemic rickets and sometimes a pediatric endocrinologist (specializes in hormones) may get involved.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose rickets?,"'Rickets is initially diagnosed clinically with a complete medical and nutritional history and with a complete physical exam by a health professional. If rickets is suspected in a child and the child has no acute symptoms such as ''seizures'' or tetany, ''X-rays'' of long bones (radius, ulna, and femur) and ribs are obtained.''Vitamin D levels, ''alkaline phosphatase'', parathyroid hormone (hormone involved in calcium and phosphate control), and ''electrolytes'', including indirect measurements of kidney function (BUN and ''creatinine''), should be evaluated if the ''X-rays'' show any of the following characteristics that are consistent with rickets:''Different causes of rickets will reveal different findings on laboratory tests. For the scope of this article, we will focus on vitamin D deficiency. In these cases, the active form of vitamin D will be decreased, parathyroid hormone will be increased, and calcium and phosphate will be decreased.' Widening or abnormally shaped metaphysis (most actively growing part of the bone below the growth plate) Obvious bowing of the femurs Osteopenia (bones which are not as dense, a sign of decreased mineralization) Rib flaring (rachitic rosary) Multiple fractures at different healing stages"
What is the treatment for rickets?,"'The treatment for rickets depends upon the cause as mentioned above in the discussion of hypophosphatemic rickets and renal rickets. In cases of nutritional rickets and vitamin D deficiency, treatment is simple. The first step is to prevent the complications of calcium and phosphate deficiency by correcting any abnormal levels with supplemental calcium or phosphate as well as the activated vitamin D (''calcitriol''). Once the diagnosis of rickets is confirmed, initiation of vitamin D supplementation is recommended, as well as a ''diet'' rich in calcium. This is especially important for children on vegan diets. The treatment for some of the bony abnormalities depends on the severity of the cases and may require referral to an orthopedic provider for evaluation.' "
What is the prognosis for rickets?,"'Outcomes for children with nutritional rickets are excellent, especially if diagnosed early. Appropriate supplementation with calcium and vitamin D will lead to healing of the bony defects within days to months. Severe bowing, seen in longer-standing cases of rickets, may also resolve over a number years without requiring surgical intervention. In patients with very advanced disease, however, the bony changes may be permanent.' "
Is it possible to prevent rickets?,"'Pediatricians, family practitioners, and obstetricians are responsible for educating parents (and expecting parents) about measures to prevent rickets. For the expecting mother, this includes recommending ''prenatal vitamins'' and appropriate nutritional counseling. For the new mother, it is important for her to be advised about vitamin D supplementation for exclusively breastfed ''babies'' and, as the child gets older and begins to wean, appropriate nutritional counseling, and reasonable sun exposure for the child.''Vitamin D insufficiency is increasingly being recognized as an under-detected health risk for people of all ages in the United States. Up to 30% of U.S. children are vitamin D deficient to some degree and worldwide this is a much higher percentage. In 2011, the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' (AAP) published a technical report titled ""UV ''Radiation'': A Hazard to Children and Adolescents"" that concluded that all ""infants, children, and adolescents receive vitamin D supplementation and avoid overexposure to sunlight and artificial sources due to the health risks (''cancer'', etc)."" Currently, studies are unclear about how much vitamin D is enough in certain populations, but the current recommendation is for at least 400 IU daily.''Given the fact that vitamin D supplementation may not be readily available worldwide, more research needs to be performed to determine the ""safe"" amount of sunlight exposure for infants and children if we are going to successfully prevent rickets throughout the world.'

What is the right brain vs. left brain theory? What is brain lateralization (split-brain)?,"'Some neuroscience researchers believe that the function of the human brain is be best explained by the concept of lateralization, meaning that the right and left hemispheres of the brain perform very different functions, and that the two communicate through their connections.''Other researchers believe that the hemisphere of the brain in charge of certain operations is more dependent upon which hemisphere is dominant for an individual.''Brain hemisphere dominance for a person often is predicted by whether he or she is right- or left-handed, and the way in which a person learns best often is categorized as left brain or right brain functioning.'  "
What are the differences between the left brain and right brain (hemispheres)?,"'Many neuroscientists consider the concept of purely left-brain vs right-brain characteristics a myth. There are numerous theories and concepts that exist to explain how the right and left hemispheres of the human brain function. Many of which, have merits, and limitations.''Researchers Michael Gazzaniga and Roger Sperry proposed the concept of lateralization. In lateralization the left hemisphere and right hemispheres of the brain have very different functions, but they communicate with each other through their physical connections. An example of lateralization is language. For most people language function is located in the left hemisphere of the brain, particularly for right-handed people. The foundation for this split-brain theory often is based on research that has been performed on patients who had their right and left hemispheres of their brain surgically disconnected to treat severe ''epilepsy''. Split-brain theory describes the left side of the brain as giving rational orders to the right side of the brain, and the right hemisphere as giving emotionally based commands.''Brain lateralization occurs in certain brain functions. In brain lateralization, certain regions of the brain perform specific functions. Many recent studies have shown that the right and left halves of the brain mostly are used equally, which shows the functional and physical connections between both the right and left hemispheres of the brain.'""Regions of the brain that are in charge of functions like memory seem to vary depending upon which hemisphere is dominant for a particular person. While people's brain becomes more left-brained or right-brained (laterlized) with age, there is no difference in physical appearance (phenotype) that is correlated to being more left- (left-lateralized) or -right-brained (right-lateralized)."" "
Which side of the brain is dominant (characteristics and functions)?,"'While no single theory completely explains the multiple complexities of brain functions, neuroimaging techniques show some distinct differences (asymmetries) between the left and right brain hemispheres, which is referred to as lateralization.''Examples of these differences include language function in the Broca surface area (sulcus) and Wernicke area of the left side of the brain, and emotional and nonverbal functions in the right side of the brain.''The areas responsible for language tends to be on the dominant side of the brain, and opposite of the handedness of a person. For example, if you are left handed, the language function areas of your brain are more likely to be located on the right side of your brain. Moreover, if you are right-handed, your speech functions are more likely to be located on the left side of your brain.''Left-brain functions are thought to include:''According to neuroscience research, the left side of the brain or hemisphere:'""Left-brain and right-brain psychology further describes left-brain functions as including: the ability to pay attention to details, fine motor movement skills, and the ability to convert sounds to language and translate their meaning. Left-brain networks also are thought to control analytical/logical thinking, including a person's mathematics ability and problem-solving skills."" Understanding the sum of any situation, getting ""the big picture” Large muscle movements like walking Sensing where one’s body is in space Balance Nonverbal communication Emotional functioning Sensing smells, sounds and taste Regulating avoidance behaviors Is positively stimulated by new experiences. Controls the immune system. Is responsible for the involuntary bodily functions, for example, breathing, heart rate, and digestion. The right brain hemisphere is thought to allow young children to understand concepts of more versus less, but the understanding of specific number values involves the left hemisphere. Other cognitive activities that tend to be governed by the right hemisphere of the brain include attention to, and processing the overall visual shape of items, understanding verbal ambiguity, and emotional and implied meanings. In terms of brain development, neuroscience research indicates that until about 3 years of age, the right brain hemisphere tends to have the primary role (is dominant) in brain function."
Is there a right brain vs. left brain test?,"'While recent research often contradicts the concept of strict right-brain vs. left-brain laterality, the way a person learns most effectively may be described by what is often categorized as left-brain or right-brain functioning. Brain Works software is thought to be an effective left-brain vs right-brain test. The test uses questions in the form of written text and graphs to calculate the dominant side of a person’s brain.' "
How does left-brain vs. right-brain dominance effect learning styles?,"'Understanding which brain hemisphere is dominant in the way a person learns can help determine the most effective way to teach that person, and how they most efficiently study and \xa0acquire information. Specifically, left-brainers are thought to be more visual learners and right-brainers more auditory learners.' "
What is the difference between a rigid and flexible sigmoidoscopy?,"'Apart from the length, the flexible sigmoidoscope is more flexible to maneuver. Thus, it produces less discomfort. The rigid ''sigmoidoscopy'' has a lesser diagnostic yield than the ''flexible sigmoidoscopy''.\xa0''Other differences between flexible sigmoidoscopy and rigid sigmoidoscopy are:' Rigid sigmoidoscopy can cause discomfort Rigid sigmoidoscopy is time-consuming Flexible sigmoidoscopy has better tolerance Ease of obtaining tissue biopsies in flexible sigmoidoscopy A restricted view of the rectum and colon is seen in rigid sigmoidoscopy"
What is a sigmoidoscopy?,"'Sigmoidoscopy is a procedure to examine the lower part of the ''large intestine'' (rectum and the lower colon). It is a short procedure lasting for about 5 to 10 minutes.''Sigmoidoscopy is used to diagnose:''An instrument known as a sigmoidoscope is used in the sigmoidoscopy. A sigmoidoscope is of two types:' polyps (small abnormal growth, which may become cancerous) colon cancer  rectal cancer inflammation (swelling) bleeding hemorrhoids Rigid sigmoidoscope: This sigmoidoscope is 25 cm long, and it allows examination of up to about 20 cm of the rectum and colon. Flexible sigmoidoscope: It is made of a flexible fiber-optic tube and can be up to 60 cm long. It allows examination of the descending colon."
Why is rigid sigmoidoscopy performed?,"'Rigid sigmoidoscopy is mainly advised in the following conditions:' Symptoms suggestive of the colon or rectal cancer Before any surgery of anus or colon For performing a biopsy of any bowel disease, which is within the reach of the instrument Assessing the length of rectal cancer (distance from the anal end) As a control treatment in case of abnormal twisting of the bowel (sigmoid volvulus)"
When should be rigid sigmoidoscopy avoided?,"'There are two reasons for avoiding rigid sigmoidoscopy: Absolute and relative.''Absolute reasons are:''Relative reasons are:' Suspected or known perforation (hole in the wall) of the small intestine Anal stenosis (narrowing of the anal canal that makes it difficult to pass the stool) Acute peritonitis (inflammation of the lining of the abdominal wall) Uncooperative, anxious or agitated patients Acute inflammatory disease of the anus Recent surgery of the colon Fulminant colitis (a rare and serious form of inflammation and sores over the lining of the colon) Toxic megacolon (a potentially deadly complication of colonic inflammation) Anal fissure (small tear in the lining of the anus) Severe coagulopathy (impaired clot formation) Severe thrombocytopenia (decreased platelet count) Severe neutropenia (decreased neutrophil count of white blood cell)"
How to get ready for a rigid sigmoidoscopy?,"'Rigid sigmoidoscopy can be performed either in a hospital or in an outpatient setting. Your doctor may share detailed instructions to help you prepare for the surgery, which involves:' Following a liquid diet for up to 24 hours before the examination. Emptying the colon on the previous night or the day of surgery, with the help of an enema or strong laxatives. Detailing medical and medication history, especially any medication allergy to your doctor."
What happens during a rigid sigmoidoscopy?,"'Rigid sigmoidoscopy is mostly performed without anesthesia. The doctor will ask you to lie on your side on the examination table. Once you lie down, the doctor will perform a digital anal examination to check for any abnormalities. Next, the doctor will gently insert the lubricated scope into the anus. The doctor will use the scope to blow air into your colon and to inflate it, as the procedure advances. This makes it easier for the doctor to examine. In the end, the scope is gently removed, and the anal area is cleaned.' "
Is rigid sigmoidoscopy painful?,"'Generally, this procedure produces some discomfort; however, it is not painful. If you feel ''pain'' at any time during the surgery, you need to immediately inform the doctor.' "
What can you expect after the surgery?,"'You can perform your normal activities after the surgery.''Contact your physician immediately, in case you have these symptoms:' You may experience cramps or bloating for a few days, which may pass away quickly. You may release gas that was put into the colon during the procedure. You may experience diarrhea and minor bleeding from the rectum. Major bleeding Dizziness Weakness Fever"
What is Schatzki's ring? What causes it?,"""Schatzki (Schatzki's) ring is described a smooth, benign (non-cancerous), circumferential, and narrow ring of tissue in the lower end of the ""'esophagus'' (the food pipe that connects the mouth to the stomach). Schatzki rings are common and are located just above the junction of the esophagus with the stomach. The cause of Schatzki rings is not clearly understood. Some doctors believe they are caused by long-term damage from reflux of stomach acid (''gastroesophageal reflux disease'', ''GERD'').' "
What are Schatzki's ring symptoms and signs?,"'The majority of these rings cause no symptoms, and people do not know they are there. As the diameter of these rings shrinks; solid, poorly chewed food, for example, steak, turkey, or hotdogs, that stays in chunks can get caught at the level of the ring. This occurs when the diameter of the ring reaches approximately 1 cm (0.4 inches).''Rarely, food becomes impacted (the food cannot pass nor can it be regurgitated). Symptoms of impacted food in the throat include''A flexible endoscope has to be inserted through the mouth into the esophagus to extract the impacted food to relieve the obstruction.'   The person with Schatzki ring then experiences chest pain or sticking sensation in the chest with swallowing (referred to as dysphagia). When the chunk of food passes into the stomach, symptoms subside quickly and the person can resume eating. If the food does not pass into the stomach, some people have to induce regurgitation of the food by sticking their finger in the back of their throat before they can begin eating. chest pain, difficulty swallowing, decreased saliva, and secretion production."
How is Schatzki's ring diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of Schatzki ring can usually be made by barium X-ray examination of the esophagus; however, a narrow ring can be missed on X-ray. In patients with symptoms of ''dysphagia'', doctors usually also order an upper intestinal ''endoscopy'' examination.' Endoscopy is the best way of diagnosing a Schatzki ring. During the endoscopy, a flexible viewing tube is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus. It allows a direct view of the inner lining of the esophagus and the stomach. The test helps to exclude early cancer, esophagitis, and Barrett's esophagus that also may cause narrowing of the esophagus."
What treatment is for Schatzki's rings? Can they be cured?,"'There is no cure for Schatzki rings. Treatment and management of the condition include procedures that will stretch or ''fracture'' the rings, which will allow solid food to pass through the esophagus more freely.'   Schatzki rings can be stretched or fractured with endoscopes or tapered dilators inserted through the mouth. They also can place deflated balloons across the ring and then inflate them. Occasionally, Schatzki rings may be cut with an electrocautery probe. Rarely, surgery is necessary to treat Schatzki rings."
What causes tinnitus?,"""There are numerous causes for tinnitus include infection inner ear damage, loud noise, medications, Meniere's syndrome, and brain aneurysm.""'Tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease, and it has a variety of causes that may arise anywhere in the hearing mechanism. It begins in the ear with the tympanic membrane and the cochlea, where the sound is transmitted and transformed into electrical energy for the brain to perceive.'

   Blood flow and/or tumors: Tinnitus that is throbbing (pulsatile) may be due to blood flow through arteries and veins adjacent to the ear, as well as tumors that are vascular, meaning that they have increased blood flow within them. Muscle spasms: Tinnitus that is described as clicking may be due to abnormalities that cause the muscle in the roof of the mouth (palate) to go into spasm. This causes the Eustachian tube, which helps equalize pressure in the ears, to repeatedly open and close. Multiple sclerosis and other neurologic diseases that are associated with muscle spasms may also be a cause of tinnitus, as they may lead to spasms of certain muscles in the middle ear that can cause repetitive clicking. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) abnormalities may cause a repeated clicking sound in the ear. Damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve: Damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve responsible for transmitting sound from the ear to the brain may cause tinnitus. Causes may include drug toxicity or a tumor (for example, acoustic neuroma). Meniere's disease, which is associated with hearing loss and vertigo also may cause tinnitus. Aging: As people age, their hearing may decrease and there can be associated tinnitus. Otosclerosis: Otosclerosis, which is caused by abnormal bone growth in the middle ear, can sometimes cause tinnitus. Trauma may also be a cause of tinnitus and hearing loss. This includes barotrauma, whereby air pressure changes can damage ear function. Examples of barotrauma include pressure changes from scuba diving or changes in air pressure when flying."
What are the symptoms of tinnitus?,"   The sound of tinnitus may be constant or it may come and go intermittently. 
	 It may be throbbing.  It may occur in one ear or in both ears.  Most 
often, the sound is a high pitched continuous tone, but it may also be described 
by the patient as a click, buzz, or a hum.  Tinnitus is often associated with hearing loss and the patient may complain 
of decreased hearing, even if the tinnitus is absent."
What kind of doctor treats tinnitus?,"'Often tinnitus can be evaluated by a primary-care doctor or internist, but if consultation is needed, an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat doctor) is the specialist that evaluates and cares for people with tinnitus. Audiologists are trained to perform hearing tests and assessments. ' "
How is tinnitus diagnosed?,"""The patient's history and description of symptoms is the key in determining what might be causing tinnitus.""'The health-care professional may ask questions in regard to the quality of the abnormal sound, and whether it is constantly present or whether it comes and goes. Other questions may include the following:''Medications:'' Be prepared to provide the health-care professional a list of medications including ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) and ''supplements'' to review since tinnitus may be a side effect of certain medications.''Physical exam:'' Physical examination will focus on the head and neck, and especially the ears, including the auditory canals and tympanic membranes. Since the sense of hearing is conducted through one of the cranial nerves (the short nerves that lead directly from the brain to the face, head and neck), a careful neurologic exam also may be performed. ''Weakness'' or numbness in the face, mouth, and neck may be associated with a tumor or other structural abnormality pressing on a nerve. The healthcare professional may listen to the flow in the carotid arteries in the neck for an abnormal sound (bruit), since carotid artery stenosis (narrowing of the artery) can transmit a sound to the ear that may cause tinnitus.''Hearing test:'' An audiogram or hearing test may be performed to look for associated hearing loss in one or both ears.''Imaging:'' Depending upon the suspected underlying cause of tinnitus, radiology tests may be performed to image the head and neck, including the structures of the ear. These imaging tests may include ''CT scan'', ''MRI'' and ''ultrasound''.''Referral to a specialist:'' Consultation with the appropriate specialist may be needed, both for diagnosis and treatment.' Does it involve one or both ears? Does the sound pulsate, or does it sound like a rush or flow? Does it click? Has there been recurrent exposure to loud noises or sound at work, at home or at play? Is there associated decreased hearing or hearing loss? Does the person feel a sensation of spinning (vertigo)?"
What are the treatments for tinnitus?,"'Tinnitus is a common complaint, with up to 15% of Americans having experienced it. It is the most common symptom reported by military service members returning from combat.'

   Tinnitus may last for weeks or months, and then resolve spontaneously. For some people tinnitus may last for years. The tinnitus may be significant enough to interfere with an individual's activities of daily living. For this reason, treatment must also be directed at decreasing the effects of tinnitus on a person's daily life, such as depression, insomnia, etc. For those people whose tinnitus is caused by an adverse or toxic reaction to a medication, stopping the drug may allow the hearing mechanism to recover; however, talk with your doctor before stopping any medication. Sometimes the adverse effects of medications on hearing may be permanent. Electrical stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation are some of the other treatment considerations available for certain individuals with tinnitus."
What home remedies soothe tinnitus symptoms?,"'The following home remedies may be of benefit to some individuals with tinnitus.' Dietary restrictions including avoiding caffeine and decreasing salt intake Smoking cessation Zinc supplements Melatonin 
Ginkgo biloba"
What medications treat tinnitus?," Benzodiazepine medications, including 
	alprazolam (Xanax), may help suppress nerve function and decrease 
	tinnitus symptoms. 
	 Corticosteroid injections into the middle ear may decrease inflammation in certain cases of tinnitus. Antidepressant medications may decrease the intensity of tinnitus or resolve the noise altogether. 
	Moreover,
	antidepressants may also help with the 
	depression that is sometimes associated with the presence of persistent and chronic tinnitus. Prostaglandin analogues, such as 
	misoprostol (Cytotec), may be of some help in some 
	people with tinnitus. "
Is there surgery to cure tinnitus?,"'Surgery may be a cure for certain people who have:' Meniere's disease (characterized by tinnitus, vertigo, and decreased 
	hearing)  Tinnitus due to glomus tumors Acoustic neuromas Sigmoid sinus diverticulum or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)"
What is retraining therapy and relief therapy?,"'There are some behavioral and cognitive therapies that have been successful in treating tinnitus. Seeking out a multidisciplinary program at a medical center that specializes in tinnitus may improve treatment success.''Tinnitus retraining therapy'' is a form of treatment that tries to retrain the nerve pathways associated with hearing that may allow the brain to get used to the abnormal sounds. Habituation allows the brain to ignore the tinnitus noise signal, and it allows the person to become unaware that it is present unless they specifically concentrate on the noise. This treatment involves counseling and wearing a sound generator. Audiologists and otolaryngologists often work together in offering this treatment.''In addition to tinnitus retraining therapy, other treatments exist which attempt to relieve tinnitus such as ''relief therapy'', and each affected individual may benefit differently depending upon the cause of the tinnitus and their response to treatment. Some other treatment options include the following:'   Masking Biofeedback 
Stress reduction Depression counseling Electrical stimulation for patients with hearing loss"
Does acupuncture treat tinnitus symptoms?,"'While scientific research has not shown the benefit of ''acupuncture'' in the treatment of tinnitus, there may be a significant positive placebo effect.' "
Can tinnitus be prevented?,"'Repeated loud noise exposure can be a cause of tinnitus as well as hearing loss. Loud music may cause short term symptoms, but repeated occupational exposure (for example, musicians, factory and construction workers) requires less intense sound levels to cause potential hearing damage leading to tinnitus. Minimizing sound exposure, therefore, decreases the risk of developing tinnitus. Sound protection equipment, like acoustic ear-muffs, may be appropriate at work and at home when exposed to loud noises.''A variety of medications may be ototoxic (damage the ear) and cause tinnitus. If tinnitus develops while you are taking a medication, stop the medication and discuss other options with your health-care professional.'  "
What's being done in research on tinnitus treatments?,"'Tinnitus remains a symptom that affects the lives of millions of people. Research is directed not only at its treatment, but also at understanding why it occurs. Research by doctors at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Dalhousie University (Canada), and Southeast China University have published research using electrophysiology and functional MRI to better understand what parts of the brain are involved in hearing and the production of tinnitus. Their research has found that much larger areas of the brain are involved with the process of hearing than previously believed, which may help direct future diagnostic and therapeutic options.' "
Is ringworm contagious?,"'Ringworm occurs in people of all ages, but it is particularly common in children. It occurs most often in warm, moist climates. Ringworm is a contagious disease and can be passed through skin-to-skin contact or by sharing combs and brushes, other personal care items, or clothing. It is also possible to become infected with ringworm after coming in contact with locker room or pool surfaces. The skin infection can also affect ''dogs'' and cats, and pets may transmit the infection to humans. It is common to have several areas of ringworm at once in different body areas.'  "
What does the term ringworm mean?,"'The term ''ringworm'' or ''ringworms'' refers to ''fungal infections'' that are on the surface of the skin. The name is derived from the early belief that the infection was due to a worm, which it is not. Ringworm is a fungal infection in the skin. Nevertheless, the name ringworm remains. Some of these fungi produce a ''rash'' of round scaly spots on the skin, but many do not. On the other hand, many round, red spots or ''rashes'' on the skin are not due to a fungal infection. A physical examination of the affected skin, evaluation of skin scrapings under the microscope, and culture tests can help health care professionals make the appropriate diagnosis and distinctions from other conditions. A proper diagnosis is best for successful treatment.''The medical term for ringworm is ''tinea''. (Tinea is the Latin name for a growing worm.) Health care professionals add another word to indicate the part of the body where the fungus is located. Tinea capitis, for instance, refers to ''scalp ringworm'', tinea corporis to fungus of the body, ''tinea pedis'' to fungus of the ''feet'', and so on.' "
What causes ringworm?,"'Although the world is full of yeasts, molds, and fungi, only a few cause skin disease. These agents are called the ''dermatophytes'' (which means ""skin fungi""). An infection with these fungi is medically known as dermatophytosis. Skin fungi can only live on the dead layer of keratin protein on top of the skin. They rarely invade deeper into the body and cannot live on mucous membranes, such as those in the mouth or vagina.''Scientific names for the most common of the dermatophyte fungi that cause ringworm include ''Trichophyton rubrum'', ''Trichophyton tonsurans'', ''Trichophyton interdigitale'', and/or ''Trichophyton mentagrophytes'', ''Microsporum canis'', and ''Epidermophyton floccosum''.' "
What are the sources of skin fungi?,"""Some fungi live only on human skin, hair, or nails. Others live on animals and only sometimes are found on human skin. Still others live in the soil. It is often difficult or impossible to identify the source of a particular person's skin fungus. The fungi may spread from person to person (anthropophilic), from animal to person (zoophilic), or from the soil to a person (geophilic).""'Heat and moisture help fungi grow and thrive, which makes them more commonly found in skin folds such as those in the groin area or between the toes. This also accounts for their reputation as being caught from showers, locker rooms, and ''swimming'' pools. This reputation is exaggerated, though, since many people with ""jock ''itch''"" or ""'""athlete's foot""'"" have not contracted the infection from locker rooms or athletic facilities.' "
What are risk factors for ringworm?,"'As described previously, it is possible to acquire ringworm from a variety of places and circumstances. The greatest risk factor is coming in contact with an affected individual. Warm, moist areas are favorable conditions for the growth of fungi, so areas such as communal showers and locker rooms are areas in which transmission is favorable. However, any contact with an infected person or a contaminated surface can cause ringworm infection.' "
What types of ringworm are there? What are ringworm symptoms and signs?,"'The following are the different types of ringworm, or tinea:''Tinea barbae'': Ringworm of the bearded area of the face and neck, with swelling and marked crusting, is often accompanied by ''itching'"", sometimes causing the hair to break off. In the days when men went to the barber daily for a shave, tinea barbae was called barber's ""'itch''.''Tinea capitis'': Scalp ringworm commonly affects children, mostly in late childhood or adolescence. This condition may spread in schools. Tinea capitis appears as scalp scaling that is associated with bald spots (in contrast to ''seborrhea'' or ''dandruff'', for instance, which do not cause ''hair loss'').\xa0Occasionally, a kerion (a pus-filled, raised swelling) may develop in severe cases of ringworm of the scalp.' "
Types of ringworm: tinea corporis and tinea cruris. What are the symptoms?,"'Tinea corporis'': When fungus affects the skin of the body, it often produces the round spots of classic ringworm. The first stage of symptoms involves a red, scaly area of skin that may be slightly raised (plaque). This stage tends to worsen rapidly. The condition progresses to form the characteristic ring shape. Sometimes, these spots have an ""active"" outer border as they slowly grow and advance. Sometimes, scaling, crusting, raised areas, or even blister-like lesions can appear, particularly in the active border. It is important to distinguish ringworm of the body from other ''skin conditions'', such as ''nummular eczema''. This condition, and others, may appear similar to ringworm, but they are not due to a fungal infection and require different treatment.''Tinea cruris'': Tinea of the groin (""jock itch"") tends to have a reddish-brown color and extends from the folds of the groin down onto one or both thighs. Other conditions that can mimic tinea cruris include yeast infections, ''psoriasis'', and ''intertrigo'', a ''chafing'' rash that results from the skin rubbing against the skin.' "
Types of ringworm: tinea faciei and tinea manus. What are the symptoms?,"'Tinea faciei (faciale)'': ringworm on the face except in the area of the beard. On the face, ringworm is rarely ring shaped. Characteristically, it causes red scaly patches with indistinct edges.''Tinea manus'': ringworm involving the hands, particularly the palms and the spaces between the fingers. It typically causes thickening (hyperkeratosis) of these areas, often on only one hand. Tinea manus is a common companion of tinea pedis (ringworm of the feet). It is also called tinea manuum.' "
Types of ringworm: tinea pedis and tinea unguium. What are the symptoms?,"'Tinea pedis'': Athlete\'s foot may cause scaling and inflammation with itching and burning irritation in the toe webs, especially the one between the fourth and fifth toes. Another common form of tinea pedis produces a thickening or scaling of the skin on the heels and soles. This is sometimes referred to as the ""moccasin distribution."" Occasionally, tinea causes ''blisters'' between the toes or on the sole. Aside from '""athlete's foot""', tinea pedis is known as tinea of the foot or, more loosely, fungal infection of the feet. Tinea pedis is an extremely common skin disorder. It is the most common and perhaps the most persistent of the fungal (tinea) infections. It is rare before adolescence. It may occur in association with other fungal skin infections such as tinea cruris (jock itch).''Tinea unguium'': Finally, fungal infection can make the fingernails and, more often, the toenails yellow, thick, and crumbly. This is referred to as ''fungal nails'' or ''onychomycosis''.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose ringworm?,"'Often, the diagnosis of ringworm is obvious from its location and appearance. Otherwise, skin scrapings for microscopic examination and a culture of the affected skin can establish the diagnosis of ringworm. If the diagnosis is unclear, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of a skin scraping can be reviewed under the microscope to confirm the diagnosis of a fungus. If a fungus infection is present and the skin problem is misdiagnosed, inappropriate treatment might be prescribed that could actually worsen the infection.'  "
What kinds of health care professionals treat ringworm?,"'Ringworm is treated by primary-care specialists, including internists, pediatricians (for ringworm in a child), and family medicine specialists. Because it is a skin condition, many people also seek medical advice from a dermatologist for ringworm. In rare, complicated ringworm infection, an infectious-disease specialist may be consulted.' "
What is the treatment for ringworm? Are there home remedies for ringworm?,"'Home remedies cannot cure ringworm. To cure ringworm, it is necessary to take antifungal medications. Ringworm can be treated topically (with external applications) or systemically (for example, with oral medications):''Topical treatment'': When fungus affects the skin of the body or the groin, many antifungal creams can clear the condition in around two weeks. Examples of such preparations include those that contain ''clotrimazole'' (Cruex cream, ''Desenex'' cream, Lotrimin cream, lotion, and solution), ''miconazole'' (''Monistat''-Derm cream), ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral'' cream), econazole (Spectazole), naftifine (''Naftin''), and ''terbinafine'' (''Lamisil'' cream and solution). These treatments are effective for many cases of ''foot fungus'' as well. Many of these antifungal creams are available as ''over-the-counter'' preparations. It is usually necessary to use topical medications for at least two weeks. More recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the antifungal medication luliconazole (Luzu), the first topical azole antifungal agent with a one-week once-daily treatment regimen for the management of tinea cruris and tinea corporis in adults aged 18 years or older.''Systemic treatment'': Some fungal infections do not respond well to external applications. Examples include scalp fungus and fungus of the nails. To penetrate these areas and for particularly severe or extensive disease, oral medications can be used.''For a long time, the only effective antifungal tablet was ''griseofulvin'' (''Fulvicin'', Grifulvin, and Gris-''PEG''). Now, other agents are available that are both safer and more effective. These include terbinafine, ''itraconazole'' (''Sporanox''), and ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan''). Oral medications are usually given for a three-month course.'  "
Is it possible to prevent ringworm?,"'Conventional wisdom holds that minimizing sweat and moisture can help prevent fungal infections. Common recommendations for ringworm ''prevention'' along these lines are for men to wear loose-fitting boxer shorts, for women to avoid pantyhose, and so forth. Whether these measures, some of which are quite difficult to implement, are really worth all of the effort is open to question.''You can also take steps to prevent spread of ringworm infections. Do not share clothing, towels, hairbrushes, combs, hair accessories, sports gear, or other personal-care items. Wearing sandals or shoes in gyms, locker rooms, and at pools can help reduce your chances of contracting '""athlete's foot""'. Be sure that your child also wears shoes in locker rooms and around pools. You should avoid touching pets that have signs of ringworm (typically bald spots). Wash hands after touching pets and be sure that a child washes his/her hands after touching pets.''If your pet has ringworm, wear gloves and long sleeves when handling your pet, and vacuum often in areas of the home frequented by your pet. You can kill fungal spores by disinfecting surfaces and bedding by using a solution of diluted chlorine bleach, benzalkonium chloride, or strong detergents. A veterinarian can treat your pet so that the infection can be eradicated.' "
What is the prognosis (outlook) for ringworm?,"'Ringworm can be cured with appropriate treatment. Ringworm of the skin typically resolves after two to three weeks of treatment, while cases of ringworm of the scalp or nails may require treatment for a few months. Complications are rare and can include a secondary bacterial skin infection or a widespread fungal infection (extremely rare and more likely to occur in individuals with suppressed immune systems).' "
What is ringworm?,"'Ringworm'' is a ''rash'' caused by a fungus in the skin. ''Ringworm'' is caused by various genera and species of fungi (for examples, ''Trichophyton'' species, ''Epidermophyton'' species). The term ''ringworm'' is used because the ''rash'' often occurs in a ringlike, circular pattern. ''Ringworm'' is also referred to as a form of tinea or dermatophytosis. Other terms for ''ringworm'' are based on the location of the infection, such as '""athlete's foot""', ''jock itch'' (groin), and others. ''Ringworm'' is a common ''skin infection'' worldwide.'  "
Is ringworm contagious?,"'Ringworm is very ''contagious'"". Ringworm can be transferred from person to person by direct contact (skin to skin) and also by indirect contact such as touching an infected person's clothing or even by touching a bench or other object that has contacted an infected person's skin. It can be acquired in ""'swimming'' pool and hot tub areas by indirect contact. Humans can acquire ringworm from animals (for example, from ''dogs'').' "
How long is ringworm contagious? Is ringworm contagious during treatment?,'Ringworm is ''contagious'' as long as lesions are present. It stops being contagious about 24-48 hours after treatment begins.' 
What is the incubation period for ringworm?,'The incubation period ranges from about 4-14 days.' 
How will I know if I am infected with ringworm?,"""The time from initial contact with the fungus to symptoms (incubation period) ranges from about 4-14 days and, depending upon what part of the body's infected, symptoms and signs can be ""'itchy'' skin with a ring-shaped ''rash'', red, scaly and cracking skin or plaques, and/or ''hair loss''. It is possible for ringworm to be contagious during the incubation period (before ringworm symptoms and signs are apparent). If the fingernails become infected, the fingernails may become discolored and thickened. Patients with abnormally ''depressed'' immune systems usually have more severe symptoms and may develop skin abscesses and large areas of infected skin. Most ringworm infections are diagnosed by a microscopic examination of skin scrapings. Sometimes a fungal culture of the infected skin area is used to identify the infection. Some clinicians suggest that close relatives of infected individuals also be treated even if they show no symptoms or signs of ringworm since often family members of an infected person frequently become infected.' "
How does ringworm spread?,"'Ringworm is easily spread from person to person by touching infected areas on another person or by touching clothing or other objects that have been in contact with an infected person. Ringworm can be spread by people using locker rooms for ''swimming'' pools or locker rooms for other athletic events. People who have ''excessive sweating'' and wear tight clothing are more susceptible to ringworm infection. Ringworm infection is common in wrestlers. Covering skin areas that are infected with ringworm does not guarantee that a person is not contagious. Theoretically, direct skin-to-skin contact in water or a swimming pool or hot tub may spread the infection but is far less likely to do so than direct skin-to-skin contact elsewhere. In addition, it is possible to become infected from infected animals that have ringworm.' "
How will I know if I am cured of ringworm?,"'In general, ringworm is not contagious about 24-48 hours after topical medication treatment. However, treatment protocols usually require about one to two weeks of treatment. If treatment is interrupted or not completed, it is possible to have ringworm reoccur. Most forms of ringworm can be treated with ''over-the-counter'' medications in cream, lotion, or powder forms. These include ''clotrimazole'' (Lotrimin, Mycelex, and many others). These medications are antifungal medications. Even if an individual is successfully cured of ringworm, it is still possible to become reinfected if the individual encounters another source of infection (an infected person or contaminated object).' "
When should I seek medical care for a ringworm infection?,"'Many individuals can be treated with ''over-the-counter'' creams and lotions and cured. However, this treatment may not work for all individuals. Individuals should contact a health care provider if they have a ringworm infection that is getting worse or does not resolve using over-the-counter medications. Ringworm on the ''scalp'' usually requires treatment with prescription antifungal medications, so these individuals should contact their physician for treatment. Individuals who have a weakened immune system must contact their physician quickly as severe infection with complications may occur, including secondary ''bacterial infections''.'  "
What is ringworm? What is eczema?,"'Ringworm'' is a common fungal infection of the skin (''ringworm'' is also termed ''tinea'' or ''dermatophytosis''), and the different types of ''ringworm'' are named for the location of the ''rash'' on the body (for example, ''tinea corporis'' [arm and/or leg], ''scalp'' [''tinea capitis'']). These infections were originally termed ''ringworm'' because they form circular ''rashes'' (rings) with redness and itchiness. ''Hair loss'' may occur. ''Eczema'' is a skin condition (''dermatitis'') in which patches of skin become dry, rough, and inflamed with ''blisters'' that are ''itchy'' and cause scratching, bleeding, and typically have no obvious cause. ''Eczema'' is also termed ''atopic dermatitis'' and has subtypes like ''contact dermatitis'', ''dyshidrotic eczema'', stasis ''dermatitis'', and neurodermatitis. It is a chronic skin disease that usually begins in ''babies'' (infants and toddlers) and can continue into adulthood. In many individuals, the cause is unknown. Stages of ''eczema'' are termed acute, subacute, and chronic.' "
What are the causes and risk factors for ringworm and eczema?,"'About 40 different fungal species can cause ''ringworm''. Signs and symptoms appear about 4-14 days after exposure to the fungus. ''Ringworm'' is ''contagious''. Risk factors include direct contact with an individual (or animal) infected with the fungus or indirect contact by sharing clothing or towels from someone infected. Other risk factors include contact sports like''In contrast to ringworm, the cause of ''eczema'' is unknown, although researchers suggest risk factors such as a family history, genetics, skin colonization with ''S. aureus'', reduced exposure to childhood diseases, and a hot climate are risk factors to trigger the disease or a flare-up. ''Eczema'' is not ''contagious''.' wrestling, walking barefoot in a locker room, close contact with animals, and wearing tight clothing."
How do signs and symptoms of ringworm differ from those of eczema?,"'Eczema'' usually has no ring formation on the skin in contrast to ringworm. The groin and axillary regions are spared in ''eczema'' but are not spared in certain ringworm infections (for example, ''tinea cruris'' or ""''jock itch''""). Ringworm is contagious, but ''eczema'' is not. Eczema has incessant pruritis (chronic severe ''itching'' sometimes with a burning sensation) that can trigger uncontrolled scratching. This is the major sign of the disease. Eczema patches on skin are usually not in a ring formation and are leathery.' "
What tests do doctors use to diagnose ringworm and eczema?,"'Ringworm may be presumptively diagnosed by simply observing the skin lesions. If a black light is used, the fungi will glow (fluoresce). Skin scrapings may be used to microscopically confirm the presence of fungi or be used to culture and identify fungi. Eczema is diagnosed essentially the same way as ringworm to rule out infections. Some doctors may do a serum IgE level to support the diagnosis of eczema.' "
How do treatments and home remedies for ringworm differ from those for eczema?,"'Treatments of ringworm are directed at curing the infection. Treatments depend on the location on the body and the severity of the infection. ''Over-the-counter'' antifungals like ''clotrimazole'', ''ketoconazole'', ''miconazole'', and ''terbinafine'' treat ringworm on the skin. ''Scalp ringworm'' usually needs prescription-strength antifungals like ''griseofulvin'', ''terbinafine'', ''itraconazole'', or ''fluconazole''. Eczema treatments do not cure the disease but are geared to reduce symptoms and/or complications of the disease. Topical creams and ointments may contain ''corticosteroids'', ''tacrolimus'"", pimecrolimis, or crisaborole. Dupilumab (injection) may also be used to modulate immune system function. Some creams claim to improve the skin's barrier function and are used in combination with other ""'drugs'' like topical steroids. In addition, ''antihistamines'' may reduce pruritis, and antibiotics and antifungals may treat the skin lesions if infected. Phototherapy (UVB light) may also reduce eczema symptoms in some patients.' "
What is the prognosis for ringworm and eczema?,"'The prognosis of ringworm is excellent when treated appropriately. Ringworm is curable. The prognosis ranges from good to fair for eczema. Some individuals may get flares of this disease over their lifetime, but treatments can reduce the symptoms. There is no cure for eczema.' "
Is it possible to prevent ringworm and eczema?,"'It is possible to prevent and reduce the risk of ringworm infections by''Athletes in contact sports should shower immediately after activity and should not share sports gear like helmets. Reduce your eczema risk by' avoiding direct contact with an infected individual, by not sharing towels and other personal items with others, washing your hands after handling pets, wearing loose clothing, and staying hydrated. avoiding any substances that trigger symptoms, taking all medication as prescribed, moisturizing your skin, avoiding sudden changes in temperature and humidity (may use a humidifier), reducing stress, use of fragrance-free cleaners, and wearing protective gloves and clothing if you handle chemicals."
What is assisted ventilation of the newborn?,"'Assisted ventilation of the ''newborn'' is a procedure to help a newborn breathe, if the baby does not spontaneously begin to breathe at birth or has difficulty ''breathing''. A mechanical ventilator provides oxygen to the ''lungs'' at the required pressure and frequency, until the baby’s respiratory system works normally.''Respiration'' is a combination of precise functioning of respiratory muscles and exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide in the lungs, with the brain regulating the entire activity. Lungs are composed of tiny air sacs known as alveoli which deliver oxygen to the blood and remove the carbon dioxide, which is exhaled.' "
What are the types of assisted ventilation for the newborn?,"'Different approaches are used in assisted ventilation depending on the reason for the infant’s respiratory distress or failure. The types of assisted ventilation include:''The continuous positive ''airway'' pressure (''CPAP'') device maintains a continuous flow of air with a stable pressure during ''inhalation'' and ''exhalation''. CPAP is delivered through nasal prongs or a mask that fits over the baby’s nose.''CPAP is used in ''babies'' who can breathe spontaneously but are in respiratory distress and need support. Early and preventive use of CPAP in preterm babies can reduce the need for mechanical ventilation. CPAP may also be used to wean a baby off mechanical ventilation.''Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is another positive airway pressure system which can be programmed to provide continuous breaths or synchronized with the baby’s own breath.''Conventional frequency ventilation is administered through a thin tube placed in the baby’s airway. Conventional frequency ventilators can be adjusted to provide airflow at different pressures and time cycles, based on the baby’s specific needs. The ventilatory parameters that can be adjusted include the following:''Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP)'': Peak inspiratory pressure is the highest level of pressure applied on the lungs during inhalation. The level of PIP is based on the baby’s lung compliance (elasticity) and chest wall motion (the rise and fall of the chest wall during breathing).\xa0''Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)'': Positive end-expiratory pressure is the air pressure that remains in the airway at the end of exhalation. PEEP helps prevent the collapse of alveoli and maintains the lung volume after exhalation.''Respiratory rate'': Rate is the number of breaths delivered per minute adjusted based on oxygen/carbon dioxide levels in the blood.''Inspiratory and expiratory times'': The inspiratory and expiratory times are adjusted based on the baby’s time constant. “Time constant” is the time taken for an alveolus to fill (inspiratory) or empty (expiratory) at a stable pressure. Inspiratory time is gradually shortened to wean the baby off the ventilator.''Inspiratory-expiratory ratio (I:E ratio)'': Inspiratory-expiratory ratio refers to the ratio of time taken for inspiration and expiration. A normal newborn has a ratio of 1:1.5 to 1:2.''Fraction of inspired oxygen'': Fraction of inspired oxygen is the concentration of oxygen in the airflow, which can be adjusted based on the baby’s oxygen saturation.''Flow rate'': Flow rate is the volume of airflow delivered per minute to maintain adequate tidal volume. Tidal volume is the volume of air that flows in or out of the lungs in a respiratory cycle.' "
What are the strategies used in assisted ventilation of the newborn?,"'Ventilation strategies are individualized based on a baby’s specific condition and requirement, to provide optimal ventilation support while preventing lung injury.''In pathophysiology ventilation strategies the ventilator settings are adjusted based on the specific physiologic cause for the baby’s respiratory distress or failure. Physiological causes include''An infant’s lungs are fragile and are highly susceptible to injury from mechanical ventilation. Studies of immature animals indicate that lung injury from ventilation occurs with high air volumes at low pressures (volutrauma), and not with low volumes and high pressures.''Lung injury may also be caused by repeated collapse and inflation of alveoli due to low end-expiratory pressure.''Two strategies followed to prevent lung injury are:''Advancement in technology has led to improved strategies in assisted ventilation. The newer methods of ventilation include:' Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS): Typical characteristics of respiratory distress syndrome are low lung compliance and functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume of air in the lungs after normal exhalation. RDS results in low blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia). Bronchopulmonary disease (BPD): Bronchopulmonary disease occurs because of underdeveloped lungs which are highly vulnerable to injury after birth. In babies with BPD, time constant varies in different areas of the lungs and resistance to airflow may increase. Persistent pulmonary hypertension: Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the lung’s arteries. This condition may occur due to underdevelopment of lungs or intrauterine hypoxia, among other reasons.  In addition to appropriate ventilation, the baby may be administered a surfactant to prevent alveolar collapse. Lung surfactant is a fatty protein that reduces surface tension at the blood-gas barrier in the alveoli. The baby is also usually administered medications to reduce the blood pressure. Permissive hypercapnia: Permissive hypercapnia is to allow an increased level of carbon dioxide in blood that a baby can tolerate, using low volume ventilation. This strategy is adopted to prevent permanent lung injury from high volume ventilation. Low tidal volume ventilation: Keeping the tidal volume low prevents overdistension of the lung and associated injury, while maintaining functional residual capacity. Patient-triggered ventilation (PTV): Patient-triggered ventilation allows the babies to take spontaneous breaths when they can, unlike the earlier versions of ventilators which deliver time-based airflow at preset frequency. Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV): SIMV delivers a mandatory number of breaths, while also allowing the baby to breathe spontaneously. SIMV detects inspiratory effort from the baby and waits until exhalation before delivering the next breath. Proportional assist ventilation (PAV): Proportional assist ventilation provides ventilation in proportion to the volume of airflow with spontaneous breaths, which can be adjusted according to the baby’s needs. Volume-targeted ventilation (VTV): Volume-targeted ventilators self-adjust the flow and maintain preset tidal volume. Tracheal gas insufflation (TGS): Tracheal gas insufflation is used as an adjunct to mechanical ventilation. Gas delivered into the trachea clears out the carbon dioxide in the respiratory tract. High-frequency ventilation (HFV): High-frequency ventilators deliver low tidal volume at a far higher respiratory rate than normal breathing. Types of high-frequency ventilation include:High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV)High-frequency flow interruption (HFFI)High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) High-frequency flow interruption (HFFI) High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)"

What is an amygdalohippocampectomy?,"'An amygdalohippocampectomy is a surgical operation to remove a portion of the brain as a treatment for temporal lobe ''epilepsy''. The procedure involves the selective removal of certain portions of the brain’s temporal lobe. The temporal lobes are located beneath the temples on either side of the head.''Temporal lobe ''epilepsy'' is the most common form of epileptic ''seizures'' that originate from a single point (focal ''epilepsy'') in the brain. A majority of temporal lobe epileptic ''seizures'' originate in the medial part of the temporal lobe.''The traditional approach of surgical treatment for temporal lobe epilepsy was removal of the entire anterior portion of the temporal lobe (anterior temporal lobectomy). A selective amygdalohippocampectomy spares the unaffected portion of the anterior temporal lobe.\xa0''In a selective amygdalohippocampectomy, the following portions of the medial temporal lobe are removed:' Amygdala: Processes and recalls emotional responses such as fear, anger and anxiety. Hippocampus: Helps form new memories and regulates motivation, memory, emotion, and learning. Parahippocampal gyrus: Surrounds the hippocampus and plays a role in spatial memory and navigation."
Why is an amygdalohippocampectomy performed?,"'An amygdalohippocampectomy is performed only for treatment of the type of epileptic seizures that''An amygdalohippocampectomy is not performed for:' Originate from the temporal lobe’s medial part Do not respond to medical therapy The surgery may be performed if imaging tests of the temporal medial region reveal Abnormality in the tissue Degeneration of the hippocampus Lesions or tumors  Neurodevelopmental abnormality Nonepileptic seizures Generalized seizures of unknown cause (idiopathic) Seizures originating in lobes other than the temporal lobe Independent epilepsy onset in both the temporal lobes Impairment of verbal, visual and spatial memory Temporal lobe seizures without clear indication of the medial region’s involvement"
How is an amygdalohippocampectomy performed?,"'An amygdalohippocampectomy is a major surgery involving a vital organ. A neurosurgeon performs the procedure using general anesthesia. The procedure may require a hospital stay of up to four days.''Amygdalohippocampectomy is performed after the patient undergoes several tests to be certain of the origin and cause of the seizures and the ''fitness'' of the patient for surgery. The tests include:''The anesthesiologist''The neurosurgeon''The patient' Blood and urine tests Neuropsychological examination of global, verbal and visual memory quotient Imaging tests such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  Video Electroencephalogram (EEG) Positron-Emission Tomography (PET) Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Ictal Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) Prior to the procedure, the patient must Avoid eating or drinking for eight hours. Check with the doctor before taking any regular medications. Inform the doctor of any allergies. Attaches an IV line and administers general anesthesia. Intubates the patient to assist breathing. Monitors the patient’s vital signs during the procedure. The patient lies flat with their face turned to one side and their head fixed with a frame to prevent movement during the procedure. Uses neuronavigational guidance for the procedure. Administers local anesthesia in the temporal scalp. Makes an incision in the scalp and retracts from the skull. Makes an opening in the skull (craniotomy). Opens and retracts the brain’s membrane (dura mater). Locates and excises (resects) the amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. Checks the cranial cavity and arrests any bleeding. Closes the dura mater with sutures and applies a surgical glue to prevent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Replaces the bone flap using surgical glue and a plate for reinforcement. Closes the incision with absorbable sutures. Is weaned off anesthesia and administered painkillers. Is monitored in the neurological ICU during recovery. Undergoes a CT scan and neurological examination that is compared with the preoperative test. Continues taking antiepileptic drugs."

What are repetitive motion disorders (RMDs?," Repetitive motion disorders (RMDs) are a family of muscular conditions that result from repeated motions performed in the course of normal work or daily activities. RMDs includecarpal tunnel syndrome,bursitis,tendonitis,epicondylitis,ganglion cyst,tenosynovitis, andtrigger finger. carpal tunnel syndrome, bursitis, tendonitis, epicondylitis, ganglion cyst, tenosynovitis, and trigger finger. RMDs are caused by too many uninterrupted repetitions of an activity or motion, unnatural or awkward motions such as twisting the arm or wrist, overexertion, incorrect posture, or muscle fatigue. RMDs occur most commonly in the hands, wrists, elbows, and shoulders, but can also happen in the neck, back, hips, knees, feet, legs, and ankles. The disorders are characterized by pain, tingling, numbness, visible swelling or redness of the affected area, and the loss of flexibility and strength. For some individuals, there may be no visible sign of injury, although they may find it hard to perform easy tasks. Over time, RMDs can cause temporary or permanent damage to the soft tissues in the body -- such as the muscles, nerves, tendons, and ligaments - and compression of nerves or tissue. Generally, RMDs affect individuals who perform repetitive tasks such as assembly line work, meat-packing, sewing, playing musical instruments, and computer work. The disorders may also affect individuals who engage in activities such as carpentry, gardening, and tennis."
Is there any treatment for repetitive motion disorders?," Treatment for RMDs usually includes reducing or stopping the motions that cause symptoms. Options include taking breaks to give the affected area time to rest, and adopting stretching and relaxation exercises. Applying ice to the affected area and using medications such as pain relievers, cortisone, and anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce pain and swelling. Splints may be able to relieve pressure on the muscles and nerves. Physical therapy may relieve the soreness and pain in the muscles and joints. In rare cases, surgery may be required to relieve symptoms and prevent permanent damage. Some employers have developed ergonomic programs to help workers adjust their pace of work and arrange office equipment to minimize problems."
What is the prognosis for repetitive motion disorders?," Most individuals with RMDs recover completely and can avoid re-injury by changing the way they perform repetitive movements, the frequency with which they perform them, and the amount of time they rest between movements. Without treatment, RMDs may result in permanent injury and complete loss of function in the affected area."
What research is being done?,'Much of the on-going research on RMDs is aimed at ''prevention'' and rehabilitation.

What is Rocky Mountain spotted fever?,"'Rocky Mountain spotted fever'' (RMSF) is a tick-borne disease caused by the bacterium ''Rickettsia rickettsii''. This illness, which is found in North, Central, and South America, is transmitted via the bite of an infected tick. The illness affects the lining of blood vessels (causing a condition termed ''vasculitis''), causing the blood vessels to leak, which ultimately can cause damage to nearly all internal organs. It is the most common cause of fatal tick-borne diseases in the United States. The fatality rate is less than 1%.' "
Where do most cases of RMSF occur in the U.S.?,"'Cases of RMSF have been reported in many areas of the country, and the disease is not restricted to the Rocky Mountain region, as its name may imply. In fact, Arkansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Tennessee account for over 60% of reported cases. In 2010, there were approximately 2,000 cases reported in the U.S., which is more than twice as many cases reported annually in the 1990s.'  "
What causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever?,"'RMSF is caused by ''Rickettsia rickettsii'', a bacterium that is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infected tick. In the United States, these ''ticks'' include the ''Rocky Mountain wood tick'' (''Dermacentor andersoni''), the American dog tick (''Dermacentor variabilis''), and the brown dog tick (''Rhipicephalus sanguineus'').' "
How is Rocky Mountain spotted fever transmitted?,"'The tick needs to bite humans and then attach itself for at least six to 10 hours for the transmission of the bacterium to occur, although transmission does not occur for up to 24 hours in some cases.' "
What are Rocky Mountain spotted fever risk factors?,"'Being outdoors in areas where the ticks carrying ''Rickettsia rickettsii'' are prevalent is the major risk factor for acquiring the disease.''Although the name of the disease includes the Rocky Mountains, it is somewhat of a misnomer as RMSF is most commonly reported in the south Atlantic and south central regions of the United States (though the Rocky Mountain region was one of the first areas where the disease was identified).''The incidence of RMSF increases when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors, which commonly occurs during the summer months, with peak periods in June and July. However, RMSF can occur during any month of the year.' "
Is Rocky Mountain spotted fever contagious?,"'RMSF is transmitted via a ''tick bite'' and cannot be transmitted from person to person. There are rare reports of RMSF being transmitted via blood transfusions, however.' "
What are Rocky Mountain spotted fever symptoms and signs?,"'RMSF typically begins with ''headaches'', a high ''fever'', and muscle aches. Some individuals may also develop ''abdominal pain'', ''nausea'', and ''vomiting''. It is frequently followed by a ''rash'' (usually two to five days after the onset of ''fever'') that appears around the ankles, forearms, and wrists. The ''rash'' consists of small, non-''itchy'"", flat pink spots that then spread to the individual's chest and back and then down the remainder of the extremities. The rash can sometimes involve the palms and soles. In some cases (about 10% of the time), no rash develops, which makes diagnosing RMSF much more difficult. In about 35%-60% of patients with RMSF, a spotty rash that is red or purple (""'petechiae'') may develop around the sixth day or later after the onset of symptoms. The appearance of this type of rash indicates that the disease has become more severe.''The damage to the lining of small blood vessels causes them to become leaky, with bleeding or clot formation leading to the following potential complications:'   Kidneys: Kidney failure may occur due to damage of the small blood vessels in the kidney. Extremities: Due to damage to the smallest blood vessels in the fingers or toes, blood flow can be disrupted, leading to gangrene, with amputation sometimes being necessary. Brain: Headaches, lethargy, confusion, and even seizures can occur due to damage to the blood vessels in the brain. Heart and lungs: Inflammation of heart tissue (myocarditis) or respiratory failure can lead to death. Eyes: Damage to the eyes may occur, often due to inflammation of the vascular structures of the eye (uveitis or retinal vasculitis)."
What is the incubation period for Rocky Mountain spotted fever?,"'The signs and symptoms of RMSF can appear within the first few days after the tick bite, or they can be delayed by up to two weeks. The typical rash usually appears approximately two to five days after the onset of fever, though it may not appear at all.' "
What specialists treat Rocky Mountain spotted fever?,"'RMSF is usually initially treated by a primary-care doctor (pediatrician, family doctor, or general internist) or emergency-medicine specialist.

How do health-care providers diagnose Rocky Mountain spotted fever?,"'RMSF can be difficult to initially diagnose, as many of the early symptoms (such as ''headache'', body aches, and fever) are commonly seen with many other viral or ''bacterial infections'"". The presence of the classic rash usually helps in establishing the diagnosis, however, not all patients with RMSF will develop a rash. A tentative clinical diagnosis of RMSF can be made based on the patient's symptoms and their physical exam, in addition to a history of possible tick exposure. The prompt initiation of treatment in suspected RMSF is crucial, even before confirmatory test results are obtained. Specialized laboratory tests (such as immunofluorescent antibody tests, latex agglutination, or enzyme immunoassays) are available to confirm the diagnosis of RMSF. However, these tests are not readily available in all health-care facilities, and results of these tests may take days or weeks.""""During infection with RMSF, an individual's immune system will develop antibodies usually within the first seven to 10 days after illness onset (therefore the confirmatory lab tests might be negative during the first week). The indirect immunofluorescent assay needs to be performed on two samples to show a rise in antibody titers (the first sample is usually taken during the first week, and the second sample about two to four weeks later).""'Additional routine blood tests, such as a ''complete blood count'', an ''electrolyte'' panel, ''liver function'' tests, and coagulation studies will be obtained. These blood tests can help monitor for any potential complications, such as ''kidney failure'' or problems with blood clotting. An ''electrocardiogram'' (''ECG'') or ''chest X-ray'' may also be obtained if there are any potential cardiac or pulmonary manifestations of the disease. In individuals who have confusion or ''seizures'', a ''CT scan'"" of the brain may also be ordered. Additional tests will depend on the patient's symptoms and the severity of the disease."" "
What is the treatment for Rocky Mountain spotted fever?,"'Antibiotics are the treatment for RMSF. ''Doxycycline'' is the antibiotic of choice in children and adults suspected of having RMSF. Antibiotic treatment is most effective if started within the first five days of symptom onset, so prompt treatment with antibiotics should be initiated in any individual suspected of having RMSF, even before confirmatory laboratory testing results are available. The early initiation of antibiotics decreases the mortality rate of RMSF from 20% to less than 1%. For individuals who are ''allergic'' to doxycycline, and in some ''pregnant'' patients, ''chloramphenicol'' (Chloromycetin, Econochlor, Ocu-Chlor) is an alternative antibiotic that can be used. Although the disease responds well to treatment, it can become life-threatening if not treated promptly.''Though certain patients with mild symptoms and signs suspected of having RMSF can be treated as outpatients with antibiotics and close follow-up, other patients with suspected RMSF will require admission to the hospital for close monitoring and further evaluation.' "
What is the prognosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever?,"'If diagnosed early and treated promptly, RMSF has a very good prognosis. Most patients will fully recover without any long-term disabilities. However, a delay in diagnosis and treatment is contributory to the higher rates of complications and mortality seen with RMSF.

What are the long-term effects of Rocky Mountain spotted fever?,"'The long-term effects of RMSF depend on the severity of the illness. Many patients recover fully without any long-term effects, whereas other individuals may suffer from permanent long-term neurologic problems and internal organ dysfunction.' "
Is there a vaccine for Rocky Mountain spotted fever?,'There are currently no ''vaccines'' available for RMSF. The best way to prevent the disease is to avoid tick bites.' 
Is it possible to prevent Rocky Mountain spotted fever?,"'RMSF can be prevented by implementing the following precautionary measures that can help avoid tick bites:'   Wear long pants and long sleeves when walking or working outside, especially in wooded areas. Use DEET-containing insect repellents. Check yourself, family members, and pets for ticks after you have been outside in a high-risk area. If a tick is found, proper removal of the tick is important. Removal of the tick should be performed with tweezers while wearing gloves. The tick should not be crushed, and care should be taken to ensure that the whole tick is removed while gently pulling the tick out. If possible, keep the tick so that identification of the tick species can be established if necessary."

What is a root canal?,"'A root canal is a treatment of the pulp of the tooth that is inflamed, infected, or dead. The dental pulp is a soft substance in the center of the tooth that consists of the nerve, blood vessels, and connective tissue. The pulp chamber is the hollow part in the center of the tooth that contains the pulp, and it continues down canals that extend through the roots of ''teeth'' and into the surrounding bone. Some roots have more than one root canal, but all have at least one canal.''Root canal treatment'' (RCT) and ''endodontic treatment'' are the more correct terms for a procedure that treats the nerve of the tooth. Endodontics is a specialty of dentistry that deals specifically with the tooth pulp and tissues surrounding the root of the tooth. A root canal problem may be treated by a general dentist or by an endodontist. An endodontist is a dentist who has gone to multiple years of specialty training after dental school to focus exclusively on root canal treatments. General dentists are qualified to perform root canals but may refer a patient to an endodontist if the tooth is particularly complicated or is being treated for the second time.''When the root canal is treated, the dental pulp is removed and all the canals and pulp chamber of the tooth are filled and sealed to prevent bacteria from entering.' "
How do you know if you need a root canal?,"'There are many things that can damage the pulp or nerve of the tooth. Often a patient will feel ''pain'' or other symptoms that alert them to needing root canal treatment, but many times there are no symptoms or warnings. The following are some of the more common reasons for needing root canal treatment.''Pain'': A ''toothache'' is the most common symptom of needing a root canal. The pain that comes from a tooth needing a root canal is fairly specific. If the tooth is still alive, the affected person will experience extreme sensitivity to hot or ''cold'"" liquids or foods and that sensitivity will continue even after the hot or cold stimulus is taken away from the tooth. Heat sensitivity, instead of cold, is a symptom that is very specific to a tooth requiring root canal treatment. The tooth may start to hurt spontaneously, in the middle of the night, or sometimes when the patient isn't even using the affected tooth to eat or drink. The pain can progress to a very severe generalized ""'headache'' that may cause the person to even forget what initially caused the pain. If the tooth is dead and has become abscessed, the patient will feel pain when he or she chews food or puts pressure on the tooth. An ''abscess'' may or may not produce swelling or bleeding around the tooth, and sometimes it causes significant swelling of the cheek, jaw, or throat. If this swelling is noticed, treatment needs are urgent -- even if that means going to urgent care or the emergency room of a hospital. Many other conditions of the mouth can masquerade as a ''toothache''. Therefore, it is very important, when feeling some pain around a tooth, to get a thorough examination with pulp vitality testing by a licensed dentist for a proper diagnosis.''Sometimes a patient may feel intense ''tooth pain'' that makes them think they need root canal treatment, but the pain is a symptom of another problem requiring a different treatment. Root surfaces that have become exposed as a result of gum recession can mimic cold sensitivity. Sinus ''congestion'' can produce pressure around the roots of the upper ''teeth'' and cause pain upon chewing, which mimics root canal pain. ''Jaw pain'' can either be an indication of pain in the jaw joint or pain referred from a tooth needing a root canal. Even ''gum disease'' can mimic the throbbing pain around teeth that can feel similar to root canal pain.'  "
How do you know if you need a root canal? (Part 2),"'Abscess (infection)'': If a tooth has become abscessed, it will require a root canal. An abscess is an infection that forms when the pulp of the tooth dies and a pus pocket forms around the end of the root. The pus accumulates in an area of dead nerve tissue that is infected with bacteria. Sometimes the abscess will form a bump that looks like a ''pimple'' on the outside of the gums. A patient may even notice pus draining from the pimple or notice a bad taste in his or her mouth.''An abscess that is left untreated will continue to grow and infect the bone around the root of the tooth. It may spread into surrounding bone and tissues. In rare cases, people have died from infections that started from a tooth abscess. Although antibiotics can help keep the infection from spreading, the only way to remove the infection completely is by performing root canal treatment and cleaning out all the dead tissue and bacteria inside the pulp chamber and root canals. There are other abscesses that can affect the teeth aside from endodontic abscesses. Periodontal abscesses can be painful, for example, and require different treatment than root canals.''Deep ''cavity'': If ''tooth decay'' extends deep into the tooth and reaches the pulp, the pulp will become infected with bacteria. When this happens, it will either become inflamed and painful or it will die and become decayed tissue. Sometimes there will be no pain, but the only way the dentist can get all of the tooth decay out of the tooth is by performing a root canal and removing the nerve that has become affected as well.' "
How do you know if you need a root canal? (Part 3),"'Trauma'': If a tooth is hit with great force, the nerve can be severed at the end of the root and eventually die. This could happen immediately after the traumatic incident, or it may happen over many years following the trauma.''Fracture'"": A tooth that has become fractured may need a root canal if the fracture extends deep into the tooth and reaches the pulp. If a tooth has fractured in a way that doesn't leave very much tooth structure left above the gum line for a ""'crown'' or other restoration, a root canal may need to be performed so a post can be placed down the canal of the tooth to help retain the restoration.''Resorption'': Root resorption is a condition whereby the tooth structure dissolves away as a reaction to injury, trauma, tooth replantation, or aggressive tooth movement during ''orthodontics''. Not all of the causes of resorption are fully understood. If the defect starts from the outside of the root and goes inward, it is called external root resorption. If the tooth dissolves from the middle or inside of the tooth and progresses toward the outside, it is classified as internal resorption. In either situation, the resorption can invade the pulp canal and the vital nerve and blood vessels contained therein. If this occurs, the tooth needs root canal treatment in combination with specialized conditioning and repairing of the defect quickly before the resorption destroys more tooth structure. The defect is typically repaired with a material called mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). Resorption usually causes no pain and is usually only diagnosed using ''X-rays''.''Repeated dental procedures'': Dental procedures produce significant ''stress'' on a tooth. Sometimes repeated drilling may cause the pulp of a tooth to become inflamed. The tooth will need to be tested by a dentist to determine whether the inflammation is reversible or irreversible.'""In the past, whenever one of these situations happened to a tooth, the only treatment option was to have it extracted. Root canal therapy is an extremely beneficial option that allows for most teeth to be saved in the mouth and used effectively for a very long time. Once the teeth are formed, they don't need the pulp to function properly. The pulp provides the tooth sensation to a stimulus like hot or cold, but it isn't required for the tooth to remain functional in a healthy mouth."" "
How is a root canal done?,"""To confirm that a tooth does indeed require root canal treatment, the dentist will take an X-ray of the root and may perform a pulp vitality test. Most pulp tests involve placing a cold stimulus on the tooth to check for a healthy response. Many teeth will be tested to compare the responses. If the test confirms the need for root canal therapy, it will be completed in either one or two appointments. The dentist will determine whether the root canal will be treated in one or two appointments based on the size and duration of an abscess and other factors. A tooth is likely to be treated in two appointments if it is getting a retreatment (being treated a second time). Patients are often curious how long a root canal takes to finish. They can generally expect one or two appointments of about 90 minutes each. An endodontist, and some general dentists, will often perform root canal treatment using a microscope that attaches to the wall and hangs over the patient's mouth. This provides magnification that helps the treatment provider locate and treat all the necessary anatomy inside the tooth.""'Before starting the root canal, the dentist will numb the tooth with local anesthesia (such as ''lidocaine'') to ensure patient comfort. When the tooth has become sufficiently numb, the dentist will place a rubber dam over the tooth. The rubber dam consists of a metal clamp that holds a latex sheet in place around the tooth so it can remain clean and isolated from saliva and contaminants.'  "
How long does a root canal take?,"'An opening is made through the top of the tooth and the pulp is removed from the chamber and canals. The canals are then cleaned with sodium hypochlorite or another disinfecting solution. The canals are then shaped with a series of files of increasing diameter to make sure all of the ''infected tooth'' structure is removed and there is room for an adequate root canal filling. A series of X-rays will be taken throughout the procedure to make sure the files are reaching the end of the root and all the canals are being adequately cleaned and shaped.''If the root canal is to be completed in two appointments, the dentist will place medicine like calcium hydroxide down the canal to help kill the bacteria at the end of the root and may prescribe an antibiotic to help combat the infection. A temporary filling will be placed to seal the opening in the tooth and a second appointment will be made for a week later or more. If the tooth is being treated in one appointment, the dentist will skip this part and go right to filling the root canal.''When the root canal is to be filled, the dentist will again numb the tooth, place a rubber dam, and remove the temporary filling material. The canals are filled with a rubber-like material called gutta percha surrounded by a sealing paste. If an endodontist has performed the root canal, a temporary filling will be placed in the opening and a general dentist will place the permanent filling. After the root canal is completed, the tooth will likely need a crown to protect it from fracturing in the future. A post may be placed down one of the canals to provide an anchor for the filling and the tooth will be built up with a permanent filling. The dentist may choose to do the crown immediately, or may wait a brief period of time to make sure the tooth is free of pain before continuing with the crown.' "
Is a root canal painful? Is there pain after getting a root canal?,"""Usually, people will say that a root canal doesn't hurt any more than getting a simple filling, and they should be able to return to their normal activities immediately. Since a person needing a root canal is often already in extreme pain, the root canal treatment actually provides relief from pain and recovery time is very minimal. When the anesthesia wears off, the gums around the tooth will be sore from the rubber dam clamp, and it may feel a little sore when chewing with that tooth -- especially if the tooth was abscessed prior to treatment. Even though the nerve is no longer inside the tooth, there are still nerve endings around the outside of the tooth that may be inflamed and irritated as a result of an abscess or the root canal treatment itself. It is best to try chewing food on the opposite side of the mouth for a few days following the root canal to give the bone and tissues around the tooth time to calm down.""'Most pain or discomfort can be controlled by taking ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') or another ''over-the-counter'' pain medication when appropriate. Ibuprofen should not be used by people taking certain blood thinners or those with ''kidney disease'"" or stomach ulcers. A person who is experiencing extreme pain following a root canal that isn't getting better after a few days should return to the treating dentist immediately for further evaluation.""  "
Are there special considerations for getting a root canal during pregnancy?,"'Since a root canal is often necessary because a person has a tooth that is either causing extreme pain or is infected, it is best to get root canal treatment immediately, even if the person is ''pregnant''. Untreated pain will produce too much ''stress'' and an abscess could critically endanger the health of the mother and developing baby. If it is possible to plan the timing of the root canal treatment, the ''second trimester'' is generally the safest time for dental procedures.  If possible, the patient should contact their OB-GYN as soon as they know they will need the root canal to keep the doctor informed and obtain any counsel necessary to protect the ''pregnancy''.   ''X-rays must be taken during the procedure, so it is imperative that a lead apron is used to protect the mother and baby. ''Tetracycline'"" must be avoided as an antibiotic, as it can affect the baby's development. If these precautions are all followed, it is generally safe to get a root canal while pregnant. "" "
What kind of problems or complications may occur after a root canal?,"'Since a tooth that has had a root canal has been hollowed out to a certain degree, it is more prone to fracture. Getting a crown placed on the tooth will almost completely prevent this, but it can still happen. Sometimes there may have been an undetected ''crack'' at the time the root canal was performed, and the tooth may need to be extracted even though the tooth was treated with a perfect root canal.''In excessively curved roots, a file could break off inside the canal. Sometimes these files can be retrieved, but many times they cannot.  If this happens, the tooth will be filled to the level of the file and monitored closely. If it was thoroughly cleaned before the file broke, the tooth may be unaffected. If not, it may need a surgical procedure to finish the root canal treatment.''Sometimes, if the pulp canal is difficult to find due to narrowing or calcification, the tooth may become perforated while attempting to locate the canal.  The tooth is perforated when the dental drill starts from the inside of the tooth and communicates a hole through to the outside of the tooth instead of remaining centered.  Many perforations can be repaired, but if severe, may cause the tooth to have to be extracted. '  "
What kind of problems or complications may occur after a root canal? (Continued),"""A root canal can become reinfected if the restoration has leaked, the patient doesn't have good oral hygiene, or because the sealing materials have degraded or broken down over time. Sometimes there may be more than the normal number of root canals in a tooth and the treating dentist may have missed the extra canal, leading to root canal failure.  This canal may harbor infected tissue and will need to be cleaned out and filled. If a root canal has become reinfected, it can usually be retreated with another root canal. In this procedure, the endodontist will simply remove the gutta percha and sealing material through the opening in the tooth, clean out the canals and any additional canals, and seal them back up again. A retreatment is likely to be done in two visits. Sometimes a retreatment isn't possible and a tooth will require a surgical procedure to be saved. In this case, an endodontist may perform an apicoectomy, which involves accessing the root of the tooth through an incision made in the gums and bone. The tip of the root may be cut off and the area is cleaned and sealed from the end of the root.""'Upper molars have roots that are very close to the sinus ''cavities''.  Sometimes the roots actually penetrate into the sinus ''cavities''.  When these roots are treated with a root canal, there may be some sinus congestion resulting from inflammation or infection around that particular root.  If some of the medicaments or sealing materials used during the root canal extrude out of the end of the root into the sinus ''cavity'', sinus problems can occur afterward.''Another condition that can occur after a root canal is discoloration of the tooth.  Sometimes, this will even happen when the nerve in the tooth dies and can be the first sign indicating that a root canal is necessary.  The tooth typically will become dark yellow, brown, or gray -- much more than surrounding teeth.  If this color is an esthetic concern to the patient, especially if it is a front tooth, it can be treated with internally bleaching that specific tooth in a dental office or covering the tooth with a veneer or crown.''There have been claims that leaving a tooth treated with a root canal inside the mouth causes a variety of health problems, including ''cancer''. These claims are based on an assumption that root canal treatment can never fully get rid of the infected tissue and tooth structure and that keeping infected tissue inside the mouth induces a response by the body that leads to health problems. Such claims are not based on sound scientific evidence and rely on coincidence and correlation for substantiation. Often, such claims are used to promote expensive alternatives to traditional dental treatments that result in profit for those making the claims. There is more evidence to refute such claims than to support them. People who believe they may need a root canal should seek out a competent licensed dentist whom they can trust to diagnose disease and deliver evidence-based dental treatment, including root canal treatment when needed. ' "
How long do root canals last?,"'Root canals are over 95% successful and can last a lifetime. The most important thing to do to make a root canal last as long as possible is get the permanent restoration (''fillings'' or crowns) on the tooth immediately following the root canal and maintain that restoration with impeccable hygiene. A tooth that has had a root canal can still get a cavity, so a person must brush and floss the tooth thoroughly to keep it healthy. Since there is no nerve in the tooth, a person will not feel any symptoms if the tooth gets a cavity. The tooth will only hurt if it gets fractured or gets another abscess around it. The dentist will want to take checkup X-rays from time to time to check the tooth for reinfection or other signs of failure. ' "
How much does a root canal cost?,"'The cost of root canals varies depending on the tooth and whether it is being treated by a general dentist or an endodontist. Molars have more canals that need to be filled, so they are more expensive, and endodontists typically charge more due to their specialty training. The procedure cost of a single-rooted tooth (incisor or canine) may be anywhere from $400 to $1,000, and a multi-rooted tooth (premolar or molar) may be anywhere from $500 to $1,400. Most dental insurance plans cover root canal treatment.'  "
Are there any alternatives to a root canal?,"'Saving the natural tooth is usually the best option, so root canal treatment is generally the treatment of choice. The only alternative to having a root canal is a tooth extraction and having it replaced with an implant, ''bridge'', or ''denture''. These procedures are more expensive than a root canal and often require more time and additional procedures to treat the surrounding teeth and tissues. If a tooth is extracted and not replaced with some type of restoration, chewing function will be impaired and teeth may shift.' "
When should a tooth be extracted instead of getting a root canal?,"""Each tooth is evaluated on a case by case basis to determine the pros and cons of root canal treatment vs. extraction.  Root canal treatment is performed in an effort to save a tooth, but just because a tooth can be treated with a root canal doesn't mean it should.  The following are some reasons a tooth may be better treated with extraction vs. root canal:"" Root fracture: A tooth that has sustained a fracture down the root or through a significant portion of the crown of the tooth will continue to hurt or be infected even after a root canal is performed and is extracted instead. Lack of remaining tooth structure: If there isn't enough healthy tooth structure above the bone for a crown to attach to, root canal treatment is worthless.  Sometimes, a crown lengthening procedure can be performed, which removes bone to expose more of the tooth.  But careful examination must be performed by the restoring dentist to determine if such a procedure will have other disadvantages and should be avoided. Third molars: Third molars, or wisdom teeth, are often not in a functional position and should be extracted rather than being preserved with root canal treatment. Significant resorption: If a large amount of a tooth has dissolved away due to internal or external resorption, a root canal may not be able to save it.  Many teeth in this situation must be extracted. Multiple root canals: The percentage chance for success decreases every time root canal treatment is performed on a tooth after the first time.  If a patient has already had a root canal and they later need a re-treatment of the root canal on the same tooth, they must compare root canal treatment with other treatment options that would replace the tooth following extraction.  In most instances, an implant supported crown will have a better chance for success than a tooth that needs a third or fourth root canal.  Ultimately, the patient must decide to what extent they will go to save the tooth, and how comfortable they feel with their treatment options.  The dentist and endodontist are very valuable in helping maintain perspective regarding the condition of a tooth and the likelihood for success with different treatment options.  "
What is rosacea? Is rosacea contagious? What does rosacea look like?,"'Rosacea (ro-zay-sha) is a common, ''acne''-like benign inflammatory skin disease of adults, with a worldwide distribution. Rosacea affects an estimated 16 million people in the United States alone and approximately 45 million worldwide. Most people with rosacea are Caucasian and have fair skin. The main symptoms and signs of rosacea include red or pink facial skin, small dilated blood vessels, small red ''bumps'' sometimes containing pus, ''cysts'', and pink or irritated eyes. Many people who have rosacea may just assume they have very sensitive skin that blushes or flushes easily.''Rosacea is considered an incurable auto-inflammatory skin condition that waxes and wanes. As opposed to traditional or teenage ''acne'', most adult patients do not ""outgrow"" rosacea. Rosacea characteristically involves the central region of the face, mainly the forehead, cheeks, chin, and the lower half of the nose. It commonly appears in people with light skin and particularly in those of English, Irish, and Scottish backgrounds. Some famous people with rosacea include the former U.S. President Bill Clinton and W.C. Fields. Alcohol intake does not directly cause rosacea, but it can be aggravated by it. Rosacea is not ''contagious'' or infectious.''The redness in rosacea, often aggravated by flushing, may cause small blood vessels in the face to enlarge (dilate) permanently and become more visible through the skin, appearing like tiny red lines (called telangiectasias). Continual or repeated episodes of flushing and blushing may promote inflammation, causing small red bumps, or ''papules'', that often resemble teenage ''acne''. Acne rosacea and adult acne are other names for rosacea. One of the most unpleasant aspects of rosacea is the overgrowth of dermal tissues producing a ""phymatous"" change in the skin. This appears as a thickening and permanent swelling of the facial tissues. A bulbous nose called rhinophyma is an example of this change.'  "
Is rosacea like acne?,"'Rosacea, although distinct from acne, does have some similarities. Unlike common acne, rosacea occurs most often in adults (30-50 years of age). Unlike ''acne vulgaris'', rosacea is devoid of ''blackheads'' and characteristically does not resolve after ''puberty''. Rosacea strikes both sexes and potentially all ages. It tends to be more frequent in women but more severe in men. It is very uncommon in children, and it is less frequent in people with dark skin.' "
What are causes and risk factors of rosacea?,"'The exact cause of rosacea is still unknown. The basic process seems to involve dilation of the small blood vessels of the face. Currently, health researchers believe that rosacea patients have a genetically mediated reduction in the ability to dampen facial inflammation that is incited by environmental factors such as ''sunburn'', demodicosis (''Demodex folliculorum'' in the hair follicles), flushing, and certain medications. Rosacea tends to affect the ""blush"" areas of the face and is more common in people who ''flush'' easily. Additionally, a variety of triggers is known to cause rosacea to flare. Emotional factors (''stress'', fear, ''anxiety'', embarrassment, etc.) may trigger blushing and aggravate rosacea. Changes in the weather, like strong winds, or a change in the humidity can cause a flare-up. Sun exposure and ''sun-damaged skin'' is associated with rosacea. ''Exercise'', alcohol consumption, ''smoking'"", emotional upsets, and spicy food are other well-known triggers that may aggravate rosacea. Many patients may also notice flares around the holidays, particularly Christmas and New Year's holidays.""'Rosacea risk factors include fair skin, English, Irish, or Scottish heredity, easy blushing, and having other family members with rosacea (called ""positive family history""). Additional risk factors include female gender, ''menopause'', and being 30-50 years of age.' "
What are rosacea symptoms and signs?,"'Typical signs and symptoms of rosacea include''The symptoms and signs of rosacea tend to come and go. The skin may be clear for weeks, months, or years and then erupt again. Rosacea tends to evolve in stages and typically causes inflammation of the skin of the face, particularly the forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin.''When rosacea first develops, it may appear, then disappear, and then reappear. However, the skin may fail to return to its normal color, and the enlarged blood vessels and ''pimples'' arrive in time. Rosacea rarely resolves spontaneously.''Rosacea generally lasts for years, and if untreated, it\xa0gradually tends to worsen.'   facial flushing, blushing, skin redness (erythema), burning, red bumps and pustules, small cysts, and thickening of the facial tissue, especially the nose."
How long does facial flushing from rosacea last?,"'Early in the course of rosacea, facial flushing is transient, lasting for minutes to hours. Later, as the disease progresses, the flushing becomes permanent and the redness does not resolve.' "
Is it possible to prevent rosacea?,"'It is not possible to prevent rosacea, but it is possible to limit one’s exposure to triggering factors. Once a patient receives a diagnosis of rosacea, it is wise to avoid factors like spicy foods, hot liquids, ''smoking'', and irritating ''cosmetics'' that are known to trigger rosacea.' "
What tests do health care professionals use to diagnose rosacea?,"'Doctors usually diagnose rosacea based on the typical red or blushed facial skin appearance and symptoms of easy facial blushing and flushing. Rosacea is\xa0 underdiagnosed, and most people with rosacea do not know they have the skin condition. Many people may not associate their intermittent flushing symptoms with a medical condition. The facial redness in rosacea may be transient and come and go very quickly.''Dermatologists are physicians who have special training in the diagnosis of rosacea. Generally, no specific tests are required for the diagnosis of rosacea.''In unusual cases, a ''skin biopsy'' may be required to help confirm the diagnosis of rosacea. Occasionally, a dermatologist may perform a noninvasive test called a skin scraping in the office to help exclude a skin ''mite'' infestation by ''Demodex'', which can look just like rosacea (and may be a triggering factor). A skin culture can help exclude other causes of facial skin bumps like ''staph'' infections or ''herpes'' infections. Blood tests are not generally required but may help exclude less common causes of facial blushing and flushing, including systemic ''lupus'', other autoimmune conditions, carcinoid, and ''dermatomyositis''.''While most cases of rosacea are straightforward, there are some atypical cases that are not as easy to diagnose. Other skin diseases and rosacea look-alikes include''Recently, there has been an association noted between rosacea and certain auto-inflammatory diseases, including ''diabetes'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'', and ''cardiovascular disease''.' acne vulgaris, Demodex folliculitis, staph infection, systemic lupus erythematosus, medication reaction (for example, niacin), seborrheic dermatitis, allergic or contact dermatitis, eczema, seasonal allergies, allergic conjunctivitis, perioral dermatitis, carcinoid syndrome, dermatomyositis, impetigo, and herpes simplex."
How does rosacea affect the nose and the eyes?,"'The nose is typically one of the first facial areas affected in rosacea. It can become red and bumpy and develop noticeable dilated small blood vessels. Left untreated, advanced stages of rosacea can cause a disfiguring nose condition called rhinophyma (ryno-fy-ma), literally growth of the nose, characterized by a bulbous, enlarged red nose and puffy cheeks (like the classic comedian W.C. Fields). There may also be thick bumps on the lower half of the nose and the nearby cheek areas. Rhinophyma occurs mainly in men. Severe rhinophyma can require surgical correction and repair.''Some people falsely attribute the prominent red nose to excessive alcohol intake, and this stigma can cause embarrassment to those with rosacea.''Rosacea may affect the eyes. Not everyone with rosacea has eye problems. A complication of advanced rosacea, known as ''ocular'' rosacea, affects the eyes. About half of all people with rosacea report feeling burning, dryness, and irritation of the tissue lining of the eyes (''conjunctivitis''). These individuals may also experience redness of the eyelids and light sensitivity. Often the eye symptoms may go completely unnoticed and not be a major concern for the individual. Many times, the physician or ophthalmologist may be the first one to notice the eye symptoms. Untreated, ocular rosacea may cause a serious complication that can damage the ''cornea'' permanently damaging vision, called rosacea keratitis. An ophthalmologist can assist in a proper eye evaluation and prescribe rosacea eyedrops. Oral antibiotics may be useful to treat skin and eye rosacea.' "
What about using acne medicine for rosacea?,"'Since there is some overlap between acne and rosacea, some of the medications may be similar. Acne and rosacea have in common several possible treatments, including (but not limited to) oral antibiotics, topical antibiotics, sulfa-based face washes, ''isotretinoin'"", and many others. It is important to seek a physician's advice before using random ""'over-the-counter'' acne medications since they can actually irritate skin that is prone to rosacea. Overall, rosacea skin tends to be more sensitive and easily irritated than that of common acne.' "
Does rosacea get worse with age?,"'Yes. Although rosacea has a variable course and is not predictable in everyone, it gradually worsens with age, especially if untreated. In small studies, many rosacea sufferers have reported that without treatment their condition had advanced from early to middle stage within a year. With good therapy, it is possible to prevent progression of rosacea.' "
What types of doctors treat rosacea?,'Dermatologists are most familiar with which option might be best for each individual. Ophthalmologists treat rosacea-related eye disease.' 
What is the treatment for rosacea?,"'There are many treatment choices for rosacea depending on the severity and extent of symptoms. Available medical treatments include antibacterial washes, topical creams, antibiotic pills, lasers, pulsed-light therapies, ''photodynamic therapy'', and isotretinoin.'""Mild rosacea may not necessarily require treatment if the individual is not bothered by the condition. Situations that are more resistant may require a combination approach, using several of the treatments at the same time. A combination approach may include prescription sulfa facial wash twice a day, applying an antibacterial cream morning and night, and taking an oral antibiotic for flares. A series of in-office laser, intense pulsed light, or photodynamic therapies may also be used in combination with the home regimen. It is advisable to seek a physician's care for the proper evaluation and treatment of rosacea.""  "
What topical medications treat rosacea?,"'With the proper treatment, patients can control rosacea symptoms and signs. Popular methods of treatment include topical (skin) medications applied by the patient once or twice a day. Topical antibiotic medication such as ''metronidazole'' (''Metrogel'') applied one to two times a day after cleansing may significantly improve rosacea. Azelaic acid (''Azelex'' cream, ''Finacea'' gel 15%) is another effective treatment for patients with rosacea. Both metronidazole and azelaic acid work to control the redness and bumps in rosacea.''Some patients elect combination therapies and notice an improvement by alternating metronidazole and azelaic acid: using one in the morning and one at night. Sodium sulfacetamide (''Klaron'' lotion) helps reduce inflammation. Other topical antibiotic creams include ''erythromycin'' and ''clindamycin'' (''Cleocin''). Topical ''ivermectin'' cream (Soolantra Cream, 1%) is also available.''Recently, a new topical prescription gel has become available designed to relieve the redness so characteristic of rosacea. ''Brimonidine'' gel (Mirvaso) and oxymetazoline hydrochloride cream (RHOFADE) applied once a day can produce a prolonged period of blanching of previously red skin in rosacea patients.' "
What oral antibiotics treat rosacea?,"'Physicians commonly prescribe oral antibiotics to patients with moderate rosacea. ''Tetracycline'' (Sumycin), ''doxycycline'' (''Vibramycin'', ''Oracea'', ''Adoxa'', ''Atridox''), and ''minocycline'' (''Dynacin'', ''Minocin''), are oral antibiotics commonly prescribed are presumed to work by reducing inflammation. A newer low-dose doxycycline preparation called Oracea (40 mg once a day) treats rosacea. The dose may be initially high and then be tapered to maintenance levels. Patients should consider common side effects and potential risks before taking oral antibiotics.''Miscellaneous medications''In occasional cases, patients may use short-term topical cortisone (steroid) preparations of minimal strength to reduce local inflammation. Some mild steroids include desonide lotion or hydrocortisone 1% cream applied sparingly once or twice a day just to the irritated areas. There is a risk of causing a rosacea flare by using topical steroids. Prolonged use of topical steroids on the face can also cause irritated skin around the mouth (perioral ''dermatitis'').''Some doctors may also suggest\xa0''tretinoin'' (Retin-A), ''tazarotene'' (''Tazorac''), or ''adapalene'' (''Differin''), which are medications also used for acne. Rarely, physicians prescribe permethrin (''Elimite'') cream for rosacea cases that are associated with skin mites. Permethrin also treats follicular ''Demodex'' mites if warranted.''Doctors infrequently prescribe isotretinoin for severe and resistant rosacea. Often physicians prescribe it after multiple other therapies have been tried for some time and have failed. Patients take a daily capsule of istotretinoin for four to six months. Typically, isotretinoin is most commonly used in the treatment of severe, common acne called acne vulgaris. Close physician monitoring and blood testing are necessary whiles on isotretinoin. Generally, at least two forms of ''birth control'' are required for females using this medication, as ''pregnancy'' is absolutely contraindicated while on isotretinoin.''In addition, prescription or over-the-counter sensitive skin cleansers may also provide symptom relief and control. Avoid harsh soaps and lotions. Simple and pure products such as Cetaphil or Purpose gentle skin cleanser may be less irritating. Patients should avoid excessive rubbing or scrubbing the face.''Other recommended cleansers include' sulfa-based washes (for example, Rosanil) and benzoyl peroxide washes (for example, Clearasil)."
What are other treatments for rosacea?,"'Many patients are now turning to laser and intense light treatments to treat the continual redness and noticeable blood vessels on the face, neck, and chest. Often considered a safe alternative, laser and intense pulse-light therapy may help improve the skin and complexion.''Laser treatment may cause some discomfort. While most patients are able to endure the procedure, ice packs and topical anesthetic cream can help alleviate the discomfort. Multiple treatments are typically necessary, and most insurances do not cover the procedure. Doctors recommend treatments in three- to six-week intervals; during this time, sun avoidance is necessary. Review risk, benefits, and alternatives with a physician prior to treatment. Combine laser treatments with photodynamic therapy (light-activated chemical using Levulan) for more noticeable results.''Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one of the newly available treatments. PDT uses a topical photosensitizer liquid that one applies to the skin and a light to activate the sensitizer. Levulan (aminolevulinic acid) and blue light, commonly used to treat pre-''cancers'' (''actinic keratosis'"") and acne vulgaris, can treat some rosacea patients. The use of PDT in rosacea is off-label, since it is primarily designed for regular acne. PDT works at reducing the inflammation; PDT is performed in a physician's office. The treatment takes anywhere from one to one and a half hours to complete. Strict sun avoidance for approximately one to three days is required after the treatment. Mild discomfort during the treatment and a mild to moderate sunburn appearance after the treatment is common. Some patients have experienced remissions (disease-free periods) of several months to years from these types of treatments. Other patients may not notice significant improvement.""'Glycolic-acid peels may additionally help improve and control rosacea in some people. Professionals can apply chemical peels to patients for approximately two to five minutes every two to four weeks. Mild stinging, ''itching'', or burning may occur and some patients experience peeling for several days after the peel. Any peel can irritate very sensitive skin and cause flares for some people. Peels should be used with caution in rosacea as not everyone is able to tolerate these treatments.''Sun exposure is a well-known flare for many rosacea sufferers. ''Sun protection'' using a wide-brimmed hat (at least 6 inches) and physical sunscreens (like zinc or titanium) are generally encouraged. Because rosacea tends to occur in mostly fair-skinned adults, physicians recommend the use of an appropriate daily ''SPF'' 50 ''sunscreen'' lotion, along with overall sun avoidance.' "
What are rosacea triggers? Is there a rosacea diet? What foods are good for rosacea?,"'While not all rosacea people are the same, there are some common rosacea triggers. Avoiding these potential triggers may also help relieve symptoms and disease flares. It may be helpful to keep a personal diary of foods and other triggers that flare rosacea symptoms.''Smoking, spicy foods, hot ''drinks'', and alcohol may cause flushing and should be avoided. Exposure to sunlight and to extreme hot and ''cold'' temperatures should be limited as much as possible. Red wine and ''chocolate'"" are two well-known rosacea triggers. Some listed foods may have no effect on one patient's rosacea but severely affect someone else. Individual reaction patterns vary greatly in rosacea. Therefore, a food diary may help to elucidate one's special triggers.""'Possible rosacea dietary triggers include''Avoid potent cortisone or steroid medications on the face because they can promote widening of the tiny blood vessels of the face (telangiectasis). Some patients experience severe rosacea flares after prolonged use of topical steroids.''Vasodilator pills can also flare rosacea. ''Vasodilators'' include certain ''blood pressure'' medications like ''nitrates'', ''calcium channel blockers'' (such as ''nifedipine'' [''Procardia'']), and ''thiazide diuretics'' (such as Dyazide).''Many skin cleansers contain these potential triggers and should be avoided in rosacea.''Foods that decrease rosacea flares include less spicy meals, nonalcoholic cool ''beverages'', ''caffeine''-free drinks, nondairy cheese, and thermally cooler meals.'   dairy, including yogurt, sour cream, cheese (except cottage cheese); alcohol, including red wine, beer, vodka, gin, bourbon, and champagne; chocolate; soy sauce; yeast extract; eggplants, avocados, spinach; some beans and pods, including lima, navy or peas; citrus fruits, including tomatoes, bananas, red plums, raisins, or figs; and spicy and temperature hot foods.

What natural rosacea treatments or home remedies can help?,"'Rosacea skin tends to be sensitive and may easily flare with self-treatment or common acne therapies. Approach any home treatment or attempts for natural remedies with some caution. As with any rosacea therapy, some people may experience sensitivity or irritation with treatment. Several possible natural remedies, including dilute vinegar cleansing and ''green tea'' applications, may be useful in rosacea.''Dilute white vinegar facial soaks or cleansing daily or weekly using approximately 1 part regular table vinegar to 6 parts water may be helpful. Vinegar helps as a natural disinfectant and can help decrease the number of yeasts and bacteria on the skin. Since vinegar may flare rosacea in some people, try a small test area before applying to the entire face.''Green tea soaks to the face may also help decrease the redness and inflammation seen in rosacea. Green tea has anti-inflammatory properties. A few commercially available products also use green tea as the active ingredient.'  "
What is the prognosis for rosacea?,"'Rosacea is an incurable chronic condition. While there is no cure for rosacea, it can be controlled with proper, regular treatment.''There are some forms of rosacea that may be significantly cleared for long periods using laser, intense pulse light, photodynamic therapy, or isotretinoin (Accutane). Although still not considered a ""cure,"" some patients experience long-lasting results and may have remissions (disease-free period of time) for months to years.' "
How should people with rosacea care for their facial skin?,"'Proper ''skin care'' involves using a gentle cleanser to wash the face twice a day. Over-washing may cause irritation. A sunscreen lotion is advisable each morning. A physician may prescribe a topical antibiotic to use once or twice a day under sunscreen.''Rubbing the face tends to irritate the reddened skin. Some cosmetics and hair sprays may also aggravate redness and swelling.''Facial skin care products such as soap, moisturizers, and sunscreens should be free of alcohol or other irritating ingredients. Apply moisturizers very gently after any topical medication has dried. When going outdoors, use sunscreens with an SPF of 50.'  "
What are treatment options for telangiectasias (the red lines)?,"'Telangiectasias are the small blood vessels that arise on the surface of the skin, commonly on around the nose, cheeks, and chin.''Patients can use simple cover-up ''makeup''\xa0for the telangiectasias. There are some green-based moisturizers or tinted foundations that may help conceal the redness.''Doctors can treat telangiectasias with a small electric needle, a laser, intense pulsed light, or minor surgery to close off the dilated blood vessels. Usually, multiple treatments are required for best results, and only a portion of the blood vessels improve with each treatment. Not everyone responds the same to these types of treatments, and a physician can help someone decide which treatment is best for his or her skin type, condition, and size of blood vessels.' Electrocautery Laser Intense pulsed light therapy"
What are treatment options for rhinophyma (the W.C. Fields nose)?,"'Surgery frequently treats rhinophyma of the nose. A physician uses a scalpel, laser, or electro surgery to remove the excess tissue. ''Dermabrasion'' can help improve the look of the ''scar tissue''. Follow-up treatments with laser or intense pulsed light may help lessen the redness. Medical maintenance therapy with oral and or topical antibiotics may be useful to decrease the chance of recurrence.' "
What effect may rosacea have on a person's life?,"""Rosacea may affect someone's life minimally, moderately, or severely depending on how active the condition is and one's overall tolerance of the skin symptoms and signs.""""Some individuals have absolutely no symptoms, and rosacea doesn't bother them. They may enjoy perfectly healthy normal lives without any effect from this benign skin condition. Some patients really like the pink glow to their cheeks and find it gives them a pleasant color without having to use blush. They may not even know they have rosacea. They usually do not want to use any treatment.""""Patients with moderate rosacea may have periodic flares that require treatment with oral antibiotics, lasers, and other therapies. They may require oral antibiotic therapy for years. Some patients complain of looking like they have been drinking alcohol when in fact they don't drink at all. Although rosacea is not a grave medical situation, severe cases may damage some patient's lives. It is important for these patients to express their concerns with their physician and to get professional help in treating their rosacea.""'Overall, promptly diagnosed and properly treated, rosacea should not prevent people with the condition from enjoying long and productive lives.' "
Where can people get more information about rosacea?,"'For more information on rosacea, contact the National Rosacea Society (NRS) at http://www.Rosacea.org or 888-no-blush. Support information and research updates may be regularly available from NRS. NRS also sponsors research grants and studies on rosacea treatment.''Additional information is available from the American Academy of Dermatology at http://www.AAD.org. Names of U.S. board-certified dermatologists are available on this web site.''While online chat groups are available on http://www.Rosacea-Support.org, these should not replace the advice of a physician. Online public posts and comments may not be scientifically or medically accurate, and people with rosacea should evaluate these cautiously.' "
What is roseola? Is roseola contagious?,"   Roseola is a mild contagious illness caused by either one of two viruses. Characteristically, roseola has a sudden onset and relatively short duration. Roseola is most common in children 6-24 months of age, with the average age of 9 months. Less frequently, older children, teens, and (rarely) adults may be infected."
What virus causes roseola?,'Roseola is primarily caused by a virus called human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and less frequently by human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7).' 
What are the risk factors for roseola?,"'Many studies have shown that the large majority of those infected with the HHV-6 or HHV-7 virus have no obvious symptoms. Their immune system clears the virus prior to the development of any symptoms. For those individuals who do develop an overt infection, the vast majority sustain no side effects. The rare individual with a compromised immune system may be at risk for a more complicated course of disease. This would include ''newborn'' infants (first six to eight weeks of life), individuals receiving ''chemotherapy'', or those with illness that impacts the immune system (such as ''HIV''-''AIDS'').' "
How does roseola spread? What is the incubation period for roseola?," Roseola is spread from person to person, typically by transfer of oral secretions. The incubation period between exposure to the virus and onset of symptoms is nine to 10 days. Humans are the only natural hosts for HHV-6 and HHV-7. Unlike some other viral infections, roseola occurs throughout the year without seasonal variation."
What are roseola symptoms and signs?,"'The signs and symptoms of HHV-6 (or HHV-7) infection vary depending upon the age of the patient.'   Infants and toddlers routinely develop sudden symptoms with an abrupt onset of a high fever (103-104 degrees) that lasts for 3-5 days. The child may also develop irritability, swollen glands in the front or back of the neck, runny nose, puffy eyelids, and mild diarrhea. Within 12-24 hours of the fever breaking, a rash rapidly appears. Older children who develop HHV-6 (or HHV-7) infection are more likely to have an illness characterized by several days of high fever and possibly a runny nose and/or diarrhea. Older children less commonly develop a rash as the fever abates."
What specialties of doctors treat roseola?,'Pediatricians and family practitioners are capable of diagnosing and managing a child with roseola. Specialists (infectious disease experts) are rarely needed to assist in the care of this generally benign disease.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose roseola?,"'The characteristic clinical pattern of sudden onset of high fever and development of the typical rash at the time of fever resolution generally enables a rapid diagnosis without any laboratory studies. For unusual presentations, patients with complications or those with immune deficiency states, several forms of blood tests can assist in establishing the diagnosis.' "
How high can the fever go with roseola?,"'The fever can be quite high. The fever averages 103.5 F (39.7 C), but it can go up as high as 106 F (41.2 C).' "
What are home remedies for roseola?,"'Since roseola patients experience a moderate fever, medications to lower fever (antipyretics) are helpful in lowering fever and lessening any associated discomfort (such as ''headache''). Such medications include ''acetaminophen'' and/or ''ibuprofen''. A cool bath (approximate water temperature of 85 degrees) may also be therapeutic. No therapy is necessary regarding the rash of roseola since it does not cause symptoms, it is short-lived, and it resolves spontaneously.' "
What is the treatment for the fever of roseola?,"'If the fever is not causing the child to be uncomfortable, the fever need not be treated. It is not necessary to awaken the child to treat a fever unless instructed to do so by a health care professional.''If someone wants to treat the fever, acetaminophen (''Tylenol'' and others) can be used. The dosage interval is every 4 hours. Ibuprofen (''Advil'', ''Motrin'"", and others) may be used in lieu of acetaminophen on an every 6-hour basis. Both families of medication are equally effective in lowering a child's fever. There is no medical benefit alternating acetaminophen with ibuprofen. ""'Aspirin'' should never be used for fever in children or adolescents.''A child with a fever should be kept comfortable and not be overdressed. Overdressing can cause the temperature to go higher. Bathing with tepid water (85 F or 29.5 C) may help bring down a fever by 1 to 1.5 degrees. If a child develops shivering during the bath, the temperature of the bath water should be raised. Never sponge a child (or an adult) with ''alcohol''; the alcohol fumes may be inhaled, causing many problems.' "
"What should 
one do if his or her child with roseola has a seizure?","""The hardest thing to do is to keep calm while helping the child to the floor and loosening any clothing around the neck. Remove any sharp objects that could cause injury, and turn the child on one side so saliva can flow from the mouth. Putting a cushion or a folded coat under the head for a pillow is fine, but do not put anything in the child's mouth. The best thing is just to wait it out. Most ""'febrile seizures'"" (whether associated with roseola or other viruses) last less than 5 minutes. Do not leave the child unattended while calling the paramedics of the doctor's office. Children are often drowsy and ""'sleep'' after a ''seizure''. That is normal. After the ''seizure'"", contact the child's health care professional to determine if the child should be immediately examined.""  "
Can the fever cause a seizure?,'Yes. The sudden and rapid rise in temperature elevation may trigger a seizure (a ''convulsion''). Febrile ''seizures'' (convulsions due to fever) are common (3%) in children between 18 months to 3 years of age. They occur in 5%-35% of children with roseola.' 
Is a seizure due to fever dangerous?,"'The seizure may look very frightening, but it is usually quite harmless (benign). Febrile ''seizures'' are ''not'' associated with long-term nervous-system side effects or ''brain damage''. Anticonvulsant medications are very rarely prescribed for the treatment or ''prevention'' of febrile seizures.' "
Is there a rash with roseola?,"'Yes, but not in the beginning. When the fever disappears, a rash appears. The rash is mainly located on the neck and torso (the abdomen, trunk, and back), but it can also be on the arms and legs (extremities).''The rash may appear as separate little raised (""goose bump"" size) dots (''papules'') or as a flat (macular) rash. The skin is often mildly red in color and temporarily blanches with pressure. The rash is not ''itchy'' or painful. It is not contagious. The rash lasts one to two days and does not return.'  "
What is most remarkable characteristic of roseola?,'What is most striking is that the child seems so well despite having a high fever.' 
How long does roseola last?,'The fever of roseola lasts 3-5 days followed by a rash lasting about one to two days that resolves without treatment. Immunity to HHV-6 seems to be lifelong.' 
Are there any complications of roseola?,'Complications are rare with roseola except in children with suppressed immune systems. Individuals with healthy immune systems generally develop lifelong immunity to HHV-6 (or HHV-7).' 
"Should 
a child with roseola see a doctor?","'Yes, an evaluation by a health care professional is a good idea. A child with a fever ''and'' a rash should ''not'' go back to child care until they are medically evaluated.'  "
When can the child return to child care?,'A child with just the rash of roseola and no fever for 24 hours can usually return to child care.' 
Is there a vaccine for roseola?,"'At this time, there is no ''vaccine'' for roseola. Due to its generally benign nature and rare rate of complications, many researchers doubt that the high financial cost to develop such a new vaccine would be worthwhile.' "
Is it possible to prevent roseola?,"'The primary mechanism for HHV-6 or HHV-7 transmission is via human-to-human respiratory droplet secretions. Therefore, basic hand-washing and avoidance of acutely ill individuals (such as those with fever) is the best way to avoid contracting the illness. Day care centers and preschools should follow routine principles of hygiene and decontamination of toys and articles shared by their children.' "
What is the prognosis for a child with roseola?,"'With the exception of immune-compromised patients, the prognosis for a child with roseola is excellent and no long-term side effects should occur.' "
Are there other names for roseola?,"'Roseola is referred to by a number of other names. It was formally called roseola infantum or roseola infantilis. Because the rash appears so suddenly (right after the fever dramatically departs), the disease is commonly called exanthem subitum.''To distinguish roseola from other childhood diseases featuring skin ''rashes'', it was once dubbed ""sixth disease"" (because it was the sixth disease young children typically developed, and it lasted about 6 days). But that name has largely been forgotten.' "
What is roseola?,"'Roseola'' (also termed ''sixth disease'', roseola infantum, and exanthema subitum) is a common viral infection that occurs mainly in children between 6-24 months of age. The virus that causes roseola is usually relatively benign, because about two-thirds of children infected have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, roseola begins with a high ''fever'' (102 F-105 F) that breaks in about three to seven days. When the ''fever'' breaks, a reddish or pinkish ''rash'' characteristic of roseola occurs all over the body (starting on the trunk and spreading to the arms, legs, and face) and lasts from a few hours to a few days. There is no specific treatment for roseola; however, the fever can be reduced with ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') and cool sponge baths.' "
Is roseola contagious? What is the incubation period for roseola?,"'Roseola is ''contagious''. It has an incubation period (from time of exposure to the virus to symptom development) from about five to 14 days. The individual remains contagious until one or two days after the fever subsides. The roseola ''rash'' may still be present, but the child or individual is usually not contagious after the fever abates. Roseola is caused by a common virus (belonging to the family of herpesviruses and termed HHV-6). This virus does not cause ''cold sores'' or genital infections. Most ''pregnant'' females (about 96%) are immune to HHV-6 so there are only rare reports of a mother contracting roseola and transferring the virus to the fetus, in which HHV-6 may cause problems like ''miscarriage'' or ''birth defects''.' "
How will I know if someone or my child has roseola?,"'If someone has roseola, usually they become infected from other individuals (for example, the children in a day-care center or siblings). The key to diagnosis of roseola is that when the fever stops, a non-itchy rash develops all over the body. The person, usually a child, has a decrease in appetite, mild ''diarrhea'', or slight ''cough'' with ''runny nose'' but otherwise seems to be acting normal. This is not unusual for a child with roseola. However, if a child develops a high fever (102 F-105 F) and the fever does not go down, the child may develop more severe symptoms. Most individuals visit their physician/pediatrician to rule out other potential problems that may produce similar but more severe symptoms (for example, ''meningitis'').' "
How is roseola transmitted?,"""Roseola is easily spread from person to person in day-care centers, preschools, and among siblings by contact with a person's respiratory secretions and/or saliva. Sharing items like cups or utensils and even toys that are sometimes chewed on by a child can spread the virus to other children easily. For those adults who have never been infected with HHV-6, they too, may become infected, but the illness is not usually as severe in adults."" "
When will I know that someone or my child is cured of roseola?,"'In general, once the fever has abated for about a day or so, the person is usually cured and no longer contagious for roseola. The rash may linger on for a few days. Fortunately, most people are infected as a child and develop an immune response that renders them protected, usually for life, against roseola.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about roseola?,"""If you or your child has a rash that doesn't improve after a few days or, more importantly, the individual has fever of about 103 F, or fever less than 103 F that lasts for about one week, or if you or your child develops any ""'seizures'"", slows or stops eating and drinking, or is not acting normal, the individual should be seen urgently by their physician or seen in a (pediatric) emergency department. If you aren't sure about what to do, contact your child's pediatrician or your physician immediately."" "
Facts you should know about rotator cuff disease," The rotator cuff is a group of four tendons. Rotator cuff disease is one of the most common causes of shoulder pain. The rotator cuff can be injured by degeneration, inflammation, or trauma. The diagnosis of rotator cuff disease can be confirmed by radiology testing. The treatment of rotator cuff disease depends on the severity of the injury to the tendons of the rotator cuff."
What is the rotator cuff?,"'The rotator cuff is the group of four tendons that stabilize the shoulder joint. The tendons hook up to the four muscles that move the shoulder in various directions.''There are four muscles whose tendons form the rotator cuff: the subscapularis muscle, which moves the arm by turning it inward (internal rotation); the supraspinatus muscle, which is responsible for elevating the arm and moving it away from the body; the infraspinatus muscle, which assists the lifting of the arm during turning the arm outward (external rotation); and the teres minor muscle, which also helps in the outward turning of the arm.' "
What causes rotator cuff disease?,"'Rotator cuff disease is damage to the rotator cuff from any cause. It can be from an acute injury or from repetitive ''strains''. This can lead to minor strain injury, partial tear of the tendons, or complete tear of tendons with loss of shoulder joint function. ''Rotator cuff injury'' is one of the most common causes of shoulder ''pain''.'  "
What are risk factors for rotator cuff disease?,"'Risk factors for rotator cuff disease include any activity that involves sudden strain movements of the shoulder against resistance. These include lifting weights, lifting overhead, tennis, ''swimming'', sports where objects are thrown (baseball or softball pitchers, football quarterbacks, etc.), and taking luggage off of racks, etc.' "
How is the rotator cuff injured?,"'The rotator cuff can be injured because of degeneration with ''aging'' or inflammation due to tendinitis, ''bursitis'', or ''arthritis'' of the shoulder. The rotator cuff is commonly injured by trauma (such as from falling and injuring the shoulder or overuse in sports). Rotator cuff injury is particularly common in people who perform repetitive overhead motions that can ''stress'' the rotator cuff. These motions are frequently associated with muscle ''fatigue''.'  "
What are rotator cuff disease symptoms and signs?,"'The most common symptom of rotator cuff disease is shoulder ''pain''. The pain is often noticed gradually and may be first noticed even a day after the actual event that may have caused the injury. Sometimes, a sudden pain occurs during a sport activity. The pain is usually located to the front and side of the shoulder and is increased when the shoulder is moved away from the body. The pain is usually noted to be more intense at nighttime and sometimes increases when lying on the affected shoulder. The pain can diminish range of motion and movement of the arm. The inflammation from the rotator cuff disease and the lack of movement due to pain can result in a ''frozen shoulder''. There can also be tenderness in the area of the inflamed tendons of the ''injured rotator cuff''.''People with rotator cuff disease usually find it difficult to lift the arm away from the body fully. If the rotator cuff disease involves severe tears of the rotator cuff tendons, it can be impossible for the patient to hold the arm up because of pain and decreased function of the tendons and muscles.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose rotator cuff disease?,"""Rotator cuff disease is suggested by the patient's history of activities and symptoms of pain in the shoulder described above. In making a diagnosis, the doctor can observe increased pain with certain movements of the shoulder. The pain is due to local inflammation and swelling in the injured tendons of the rotator cuff. Additionally, with severe tendon tears of the rotator cuff, the arm falls due to ""'weakness'' (positive drop arm sign) when moved away from the body.''The diagnosis of rotator cuff disease can be confirmed by radiology testing. Sometimes ''X-rays'' can show bony injuries, which suggest long-standing severe rotator cuff disease. An arthrogram involves injecting contrast dye into the shoulder joint to detect leakage out of the injured rotator cuff. The ''MRI'' is a noninvasive imaging test that uses a magnet and computer to produce detailed images of the tissues of the shoulder. An MRI has the added advantage of providing more information than either X-ray or an arthrogram, especially if a condition other than rotator cuff disease is present.' "
What is the treatment for rotator cuff disease?,"'The treatment of rotator cuff disease depends on the severity of the injury to the tendons of the rotator cuff and the underlying condition of the patient.''Mild rotator cuff disease is treated with ice, rest, and anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''ibuprofen'' [''Advil'', ''Motrin''] and others). Generally, physical therapy using gradual ''exercise'' rehabilitation is instituted. Exercises are used that are specifically designed for rotator-cuff strengthening.''Patients with persistent pain and motion limitation can often benefit by a ''cortisone injection'' around the rotator cuff. Repeat injections may be necessary.''More severe rotator cuff disease can require surgical repair.''Subacromial decompression is the removal of a small portion of the bone (acromion) and soft tissues (bursa) that surround the rotator cuff. This removal can relieve pressure on the rotator cuff in certain conditions and promote healing and recovery. This procedure can be done by arthroscopic or open surgical techniques. Both methods have been reported to be equally successful.''The most severe rotator cuff disease, complete full-thickness rotator cuff tears, usually requires surgery for the best results. These procedures, which can also be done by either ''arthroscopy'' or open surgery, involve mending the torn rotator cuff by suturing the tissues back together. Ultimately, recovery from rotator cuff disease often requires extended physical therapy and rehabilitation.'  "
Are there home remedies for rotator cuff disease?,"'Mild rotator cuff disease is treated with ''cold'' packs, rest, and anti-inflammatory medications (such as ibuprofen and others). It is essential to avoid reinjuring the shoulder by avoiding activities that ''stress'' the joint.' "
What are complications of rotator cuff disease?,'The most serious complication of rotator cuff disease is ''frozen shoulder''. Frozen shoulder is a result of scarring that occurs around the inflamed joint and leads to loss of range of motion and function of the joint. Frozen shoulder is also referred to as ''adhesive capsulitis''.' 
What specialists treat rotator cuff disease?,"'Specialists who treat rotator cuff disease include generalists, including general practitioners, family practitioners, and internists, as well as orthopedic surgeons, physiatrists, ''rheumatologists'', and physical therapists.' "
"What is the prognosis 
(outlook) for rotator cuff disease?","'Without treatment, the shoulder can permanently lose full function from rotator cuff disease. Minor rotator cuff injuries cause mild to moderate dysfunction. Severe rotator cuff injuries can cause complete dysfunction of the shoulder joint. Scarring around the shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) can lead to a marked restriction of the range of shoulder motion (frozen shoulder).''Extensive need for rehabilitation and physical therapy is the norm with significant rotator cuff disease. Some patients never recover full function of the shoulder joint.' "
Is it possible to prevent rotator cuff disease?,"'Rotator cuff disease can be prevented by avoiding injury to the tendons of the shoulder. Rotator cuff disease can also be prevented by strengthening the rotator cuff muscles with exercises designed for this purpose. Repetitive strains, especially arm movements over the head, should be limited.' "
What is rotavirus?,"'Rotavirus is a virus that infects the bowels, causing a severe inflammation of the stomach and bowels (known as gastroenteritis). Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe ''diarrhea'' among infants and children throughout the world and causes the death of about 500,000 children worldwide annually. The name rotavirus comes from the characteristic wheel-like appearance of the virus when viewed by electron microscopy (the name rotavirus comes from the Latin ''rota'', meaning ""wheel"").''Since 2006, ''vaccines'' have been available for rotavirus infection. Prior to the availability of a rotavirus ''vaccine'', rotavirus infected almost all children by their third birthday. Repeat infections with different viral strains are possible, and most children had several episodes of rotavirus infection in the first years of life. After several infections with different strains of the virus, children acquire immunity to rotavirus. ''Babies'' and toddlers between 6-24 months of age are at greatest risk for developing severe disease from rotavirus infection. Adults sometimes become infected, but the resulting illness is usually mild.''Worldwide, rotavirus infection is still a significant cause of death in infants and children. Rotavirus affects populations in all socioeconomic groups and is equally prevalent in industrialized and developing countries, so differences in sanitation practices or water supply are not likely to affect the incidence of the infection.''In the U.S., rotavirus infections usually peak in the fall months in the Southwest and spread to the Northeast by spring, so infections are most common during the winter months from November to May. However, infection with rotavirus can occur anytime of the year.'  "
What causes rotavirus infections?,"'The rotavirus is a member of the ''Reoviridae'' family of ''viruses'' and contains double-stranded RNA enclosed by a double-shelled outer layer (capsid). Infection with different strains of the virus is possible, so it is common to have several separate rotavirus infections in childhood. Adults may also become infected, but the resulting illness is usually less severe than that in infants and young children.' "
Rotavirus vs. norovirus,"'Norovirus'' is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in the U.S. Noroviruses cause about 50%-70% of cases of gastroenteritis in adults, whereas rotavirus most typically affects young children. Like rotavirus, norovirus is highly contagious and spreads rapidly. Contaminated food and liquids can transmit noroviruses, as can touching objects contaminated with norovirus and then placing the hands or fingers in the mouth, direct contact with an infected individual, and contact with infected individuals and objects in day care centers and ''nursing'' homes.' "
What are risk factors for rotavirus infection?,"'Rotavirus most commonly infects infants and children. Since rotavirus infection is highly contagious, those who are around infected people are at high risk of infection. For this reason, children in group day care settings are at risk. However, rotavirus infects most children by 3 years of age.' "
Can adults get a rotavirus infection?,"'Yes, it is possible for anyone to develop a rotavirus infection. However, most adults who become infected have only minor symptoms, or may not have symptoms at all. Since neither vaccination nor previous infection provides full immunity, it is possible to get rotavirus infection more than once. The first infection tends to produce more severe symptoms than subsequent infections, and vaccination is very effective in infants in preventing severe symptoms (see below).' "
What is the incubation period for rotavirus?,"'The time from initial infection to symptoms (incubation period) for rotavirus disease is typically around two days, but varies from one to three days.' "
"What are rotavirus 
infection symptoms and signs?","'Symptoms of the disease include ''fever'', ''vomiting'', and watery diarrhea. ''Abdominal pain'' may also occur, and infected children may have profuse watery diarrhea up to several times per day. Symptoms generally persist for three to nine days. Immunity from repeated infection is incomplete after a rotavirus infection, but repeated infections tend to be less severe than the original infection.''Rotavirus infection can be associated with severe ''dehydration'' in infants and children. Severe dehydration can lead to death in rare cases, so it is important to recognize and treat this complication of rotavirus infection. In addition to the symptoms of rotavirus infection discussed above, parents should be aware of the ''symptoms of dehydration'' that can occur with rotavirus infection or with other serious conditions.''Symptoms of dehydration include'   lethargy, dry, cool skin, absence of tears when crying, dry or sticky mouth, sunken eyes or sunken fontanel (the soft spot on the head of infants), and extreme thirst."
Is rotavirus contagious? How long is rotavirus contagious?,'Rotavirus infection is highly contagious. Contamination of hands or surfaces with the ''stool'' of an infected person and then touching the mouth is the main method of spread. Rotavirus infection is contagious (can be spread to other people) from the time before diarrhea develops until up to 10 days after symptoms have disappeared.' 
How does rotavirus spread?,"'The primary mode of transmission of rotavirus is the passage of the virus in ''stool'' to the mouth of another child, known as a fecal-oral route of transmission. Children can transmit the virus when they forget to wash their hands before eating or after using the toilet. Touching a surface contaminated with rotavirus and then touching the mouth area can result in infection.''There also have been cases of low levels of rotavirus in respiratory-tract secretions and other body fluids. Because the virus is stable (remains infective) in the environment, transmission can occur through ingestion of contaminated water or food and contact with contaminated surfaces. Rotavirus can survive for days on hard and dry surfaces, and it can live for hours on human hands.' "
What specialists treat rotavirus infection?,"'Primary care specialists, including pediatricians and family medicine specialists, treat rotavirus infection. Severe or complicated cases may require the intervention of other specialists, including emergency and intensive care physicians.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose a rotavirus infection?,"'Physicians diagnose rotavirus by the rapid detection of rotavirus in stool specimens. Physicians may further characterized strains of rotavirus may by special testing with enzyme immunoassay or ''polymerase chain reaction'', but such testing is not commonly available or necessary.' "
What is the treatment for a rotavirus infection?,"'There is no specific treatment for rotavirus. For people with healthy immune systems, rotavirus infection of the bowel (gastroenteritis) is a self-limited illness, lasting for only a few days. The treatment consists of increased fluid intake (oral rehydration) to prevent dehydration. About one in 40 children with rotavirus infection of the bowel requires hospitalization for hydration with intravenous fluid.' "
"What is the prognosis of 
a rotavirus infection?","'Rotavirus infection is a self-limited disease that resolves after three to nine days of symptoms. Rarely, severe dehydration accompanying rotavirus infection has led to death. Recognition of the condition and proper supportive treatment (rehydration) can prevent serious complications.' "
Can a vaccine prevent rotavirus infections? Are any side effects associated with the rotavirus vaccine?,"'Because the virus is so prevalent, it is very difficult or even impossible to prevent rotavirus infection in people who did not receive the vaccine. Contamination is possible even in places with excellent standards of hygiene and sanitation. Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure and is very effective in preventing severe rotavirus disease in young children and infants.''There are two rotavirus vaccines licensed for vaccinating infants in the United States, known as RotaTeq and Rotarix. Both vaccines are given orally and do not require an injection. The rotavirus vaccines are most effective if administered before age 15 weeks, and all doses should be complete by 8 months of age.''Side effects of the rotavirus vaccine are very uncommon. As with all vaccines, rare ''allergic'' reactions may occur. Other uncommon side effects are temporary and can include irritability, vomiting, and diarrhea.'  Health care professionals administer RotaTeq (RV5) on a schedule of three doses at ages 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. Health care providers administer Rotarix (RV1) on a schedule of two doses at ages 2 months and 4 months."
What is Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS)?,"'Rothmund-Thomson syndrome'' is a rare condition that affects many parts of the body, particularly the skin. ' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome?,"'People with this condition typically develop redness on the cheeks between ages 3 months and 6 months. Over time the ''rash'' spreads to the arms and legs, causing patchy changes in skin coloring, areas of skin tissue degeneration (atrophy), and small clusters of enlarged blood vessels just under the skin (telangiectases). These skin problems persist for life, and are collectively known as poikiloderma.''Rothmund-Thomson syndrome is also characterized by:''The varied signs and symptoms of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome overlap with features of other disorders, namely Baller-Gerold syndrome and RAPADILINO syndrome. These syndromes are also characterized by radial ray defects, skeletal abnormalities, and slow growth. All of these conditions can be caused by mutations in the same gene. Based on these similarities, researchers are investigating whether Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, Baller-Gerold syndrome, and RAPADILINO syndrome are separate disorders or part of a single syndrome with overlapping signs and symptoms.'  sparse hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes;  slow growth and small stature;  abnormalities of the teeth and nails; and gastrointestinal

What are the signs and symptoms of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome?,"'People with this condition typically develop redness on the cheeks between ages 3 months and 6 months. Over time the ''rash'' spreads to the arms and legs, causing patchy changes in skin coloring, areas of skin tissue degeneration (atrophy), and small clusters of enlarged blood vessels just under the skin (telangiectases).

What is reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD)?,"'Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is a condition that features a group of typical symptoms, including ''pain'' (often ""burning"" type), tenderness, and swelling of an extremity associated with varying degrees of ''sweating'', warmth and/or coolness, flushing, discoloration, and shiny skin. RSD is also referred to as ""''complex regional pain syndrome'',"" ""the shoulder-hand syndrome,"" ""causalgia,"" and ""Sudeck\'s atrophy.""'  "
What causes reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD)?,"'The exact mechanism of how RSD develops is poorly understood. The theories include irritation and abnormal excitation of nervous tissue, leading to abnormal impulses along nerves that affect blood vessels and skin. The involuntary nervous system, peripheral nerves, and brain seem to be involved.''A variety of events can trigger the RSD, including:' injury, surgery, heart disease, degenerative arthritis of the neck, stroke or other brain diseases, nerve irritation by entrapment (such as carpal tunnel syndrome), shingles, shoulder problems, breast cancer, and drugs for tuberculosis and barbiturates."
What are the symptoms of reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD)?,"'The onset of RSD symptoms may be rapid or gradual. The condition may not display all features. It is bilateral (involving both sides of the body) in up to half of people with RSD. There are several stages of RSD with symptoms that include:'   Acute (three to six months): burning, flushing, blanching, sweating, swelling, pain, and tenderness. This stage can show early X-ray changes of patchy bone thinning. Dystrophic (three to six months): early skin changes of shiny, thickened skin and contracture with persistent pain, but diminished swelling and flushing. Atrophic (may be long-standing): loss of motion and function of the involved hand or foot with contracture (flexed scarring process), and thinning of the fatty layers under the skin. X-ray can show significant osteoporosis. "
How is reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) diagnosed?,"'RSD is diagnosed based on the clinical features described previously. Blood tests are not abnormal because of RSD, though the associated triggering events mentioned previously may lead to abnormalities in laboratory testing. Plain film X-ray testing and ''MRI'' scanning can show patchy thinning or significant ''osteoporosis''. Nuclear bone scanning can show characteristic uptake patterns.' "
What is the treatment for reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD)?,"'Response to treatment of RSD is greater in the earlier stages of the condition than in the later stages. '   Cool, moist applications to the affected areas can provide some relief of burning symptoms.  Gradual exercise can help prevent contractures.  Medications for pain and inflammation can also reduce symptoms.  For persisting symptoms, high doses of prednisone (cortisone) may be used for periods of weeks, depending on the response, and then gradually reduced.  Other medications that may be of benefit include amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep), pregabalin (Lyrica), and clonidine (Catapres, Catapres=TTS, Jenloga).  Occasionally, a nerve block with anesthetic injected into a specialized area of the involuntary nervous system (for example, a stellate ganglion blockade) can help both in treatment and in establishing the diagnosis. Sometimes a series of these blocks is tried. Other treatments include surgically interrupting the nerves (the sympathetic nerves) of the involuntary nervous system (surgical sympathectomy), implanting pumps with pain medication into the spinal canal (intrathecal drug pumps), and spinal cord stimulation devices."
Can reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) be prevented?,"'There is some evidence that early immobilization of patients with ''stroke'' or ''heart attack'' can help decrease the chances of developing RSD. Also, there have been studies demonstrating a decrease in the risk of developing RSD in patients with bony ''fractures'' using daily ''Vitamin C'' supplementation. ' "
What is the prognosis for reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD),"'The prognosis (outlook) and response to treatment in patients with RSD is unpredictable. As previously mentioned, instituting treatment early in the course of the condition leads to better outcomes.' "
What are repetitive motion disorders (RMDs?," Repetitive motion disorders (RMDs) are a family of muscular conditions that result from repeated motions performed in the course of normal work or daily activities. RMDs includecarpal tunnel syndrome,bursitis,tendonitis,epicondylitis,ganglion cyst,tenosynovitis, andtrigger finger. carpal tunnel syndrome, bursitis, tendonitis, epicondylitis, ganglion cyst, tenosynovitis, and trigger finger. RMDs are caused by too many uninterrupted repetitions of an activity or motion, unnatural or awkward motions such as twisting the arm or wrist, overexertion, incorrect posture, or muscle fatigue. RMDs occur most commonly in the hands, wrists, elbows, and shoulders, but can also happen in the neck, back, hips, knees, feet, legs, and ankles. The disorders are characterized by pain, tingling, numbness, visible swelling or redness of the affected area, and the loss of flexibility and strength. For some individuals, there may be no visible sign of injury, although they may find it hard to perform easy tasks. Over time, RMDs can cause temporary or permanent damage to the soft tissues in the body -- such as the muscles, nerves, tendons, and ligaments - and compression of nerves or tissue. Generally, RMDs affect individuals who perform repetitive tasks such as assembly line work, meat-packing, sewing, playing musical instruments, and computer work. The disorders may also affect individuals who engage in activities such as carpentry, gardening, and tennis."
Is there any treatment for repetitive motion disorders?," Treatment for RMDs usually includes reducing or stopping the motions that cause symptoms. Options include taking breaks to give the affected area time to rest, and adopting stretching and relaxation exercises. Applying ice to the affected area and using medications such as pain relievers, cortisone, and anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce pain and swelling. Splints may be able to relieve pressure on the muscles and nerves. Physical therapy may relieve the soreness and pain in the muscles and joints. In rare cases, surgery may be required to relieve symptoms and prevent permanent damage. Some employers have developed ergonomic programs to help workers adjust their pace of work and arrange office equipment to minimize problems."
What is the prognosis for repetitive motion disorders?," Most individuals with RMDs recover completely and can avoid re-injury by changing the way they perform repetitive movements, the frequency with which they perform them, and the amount of time they rest between movements. Without treatment, RMDs may result in permanent injury and complete loss of function in the affected area."
What research is being done?,'Much of the on-going research on RMDs is aimed at ''prevention'' and rehabilitation.

What is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)?,"'The ''respiratory syncytial virus'' (RSV), discovered in 1956, is capable of causing a broad spectrum of illnesses. Older children and adults will commonly experience a ""bad ''cold''"" lasting one to two weeks. ''Fever'', nasal ''congestion'', and ''cough'' are their most common complaints. However, in ''babies'' and toddlers, RSV can produce severe pulmonary diseases, including ''bronchiolitis'' (inflammation of the terminal airways that produces wheezing) and ''pneumonia'' (infection of these terminal airways).' "
"When does RSV infection occur, and who gets it?","'Infection with RSV is seasonal. In temperate climates, RSV infections usually occur during the late fall, winter, or early spring months.''More than half of all infants are exposed to RSV by their first birthday. Many have few or mild symptoms. However, some babies with RSV become very ill. RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and ''pneumonia'' among infants and children under 1 year of age.''Since an initial RSV infection does not trigger a robust long-term immune system response, after childhood, RSV may cause repeated infections throughout life.' Annual community outbreaks of RSV infection often last four to five months. The winter season (November through April) tend to be most likely to experience RSV epidemic disease. For unknown reasons, severity of illness and frequency of disease often alternate on an annual basis. For example: a ""bad"" year (large number of patients with moderately severe disease) is followed by a ""good"" year (fewer number of patients with less severe disease). These infections are usually associated with cold-like symptoms. However, severe lower respiratory tract disease (for example, wheezing and/or pneumonia) may occur at any age, especially among the elderly or among those with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems. An RSV infection may exacerbate conditions such as asthma, COPD, and congestive heart failure."
Who is at risk for severe disease?,"'Several broad categories of patients are most vulnerable to RSV infection. These include:' premature infants and all infants less than 1 year of age, children 2 years old with cardiac disease or chronic lung disease (for example, asthma, cystic fibrosis, etc.), those of any age with a compromised immune system, and those 65 years of age or older."
"Is RSV infection contagious, and how does RSV infection spread?","'RSV disease is highly contagious. Annually 100,000-120,000 babies less than 1 year old require hospitalization.' The RSV incubation period (time between exposure and development of symptoms) is two to eight days. It spreads via respiratory secretions through close contact with infected people or contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. Infection can occur when infectious particles contacts mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth, or nose, and possibly through the inhalation of droplets generated by a sneeze or cough. Those who develop RSV are contagious during the first three to eight days of their illness. RSV can live for many hours on common household objects such as furniture and tabletops. As such, disease transmission may be indirect by hand to mouth after touching such contaminated surfaces. This mode of transmission is especially common between infants and toddlers."
What are the symptoms of RSV infection?,"'Following childhood, RSV may cause repeated infections with moderate-to-severe ''cold-like symptoms'' although severe lower respiratory tract disease (pneumonia and/or wheezing) may occur with RSV at any age.'   The symptoms in most infants are similar to those of a bad cold. These include fever, prominent runny nose, cough, and nasal congestion. The duration of these symptoms is one to two weeks. During their first RSV infection, some babies and young children also have signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Bronchiolitis is a clinical state of infants (by definition) during which inflammation of the terminal airways restricts airflow and may produce wheezing. The majority of children hospitalized for RSV infection are under 6 months of age. The need for supplemental oxygen, IV fluids, and pulmonary inhalation therapy are the most common indicators for hospitalization.If wheezing causes an infant's respiratory rate to increase substantially, they may have a difficult time taking in adequate fluids and become dehydrated. If wheezing causes an infant's respiratory rate to increase substantially, they may have a difficult time taking in adequate fluids and become dehydrated."
How do health care professionals diagnose RSV infection?,"'Health care professionals make a diagnosis of RSV infection using a number of different laboratory tests, including''Most clinical laboratories today use nasal swab tests based on antigen detection to diagnose RSV infection. This technique is 80%-90% reliable. A newer test protocol (RT-''PCR'') is more reliable and is replacing the antigen-detecting test in many hospitals and community laboratories.' isolation of the virus, detection of viral antigens, detection of viral RNA, demonstration of a rise in serum antibodies, or a combination of these approaches."
What is the treatment for an RSV infection?,"'For children with mild RSV disease, no specific treatment is necessary other than the treatment of symptoms (such as ''acetaminophen'' [''Tylenol''] to reduce fever). RSV infection is a viral illness and antibiotic therapy will not be helpful.''Children with more severe disease may require supplemental oxygen and sometimes mechanical ventilation (respiratory support via a ''breathing'' machine). Health care providers may use ''ribavirin'' aerosol (Virazole) in the treatment of some hospitalized patients with severe disease. Some investigators have used a combination of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) with high titers of neutralizing RSV antibody (RSV-IVIG) and ribavirin to treat patients with compromised immune systems.''The American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' has recently published guidelines for children from one month of age through 23 months of age dealing with bronchiolitis (most commonly caused by RVS). Previous recommendations were updated and recommend against nebulizer (inhalation) therapy employing ''albuterol'', steroids, or hypertonic (highly concentrated) saline.'  "
Is it possible to prevent RSV infection?,"'Frequent hand washing and not sharing items such as cups, glasses, and utensils with people who have RSV illness should decrease the spread of virus to others.''Excluding children with colds or other respiratory illnesses (without fever) who are well enough to attend child care or school settings will probably ''not'' decrease the transmission of RSV, since it is often spread in the early stages of illness prior to the development of more severe symptoms.''In a hospital setting, RSV transmission can and should be prevented by strict attention to contact precautions, such as hand washing and wearing gowns, facemasks, and gloves.''In 1998, a new product called palivizumab (Synagis) was licensed to help prevent severe RSV disease in certain high-risk infants with predisposing factors such as moderate/severe prematurity, chronic lung disease, congenital ''heart disease'', etc. Palivizumab is not a treatment for RSV but rather a tool to help prevent RSV infection. Those receiving Synagis receive a monthly injection during the RSV season. Synagis is quite expensive, and insurance companies often have strict guidelines limiting those for whom they will pay this medication.' "
Is there an RSV vaccine?,"'Unfortunately, there is no RSV ''vaccine'' yet, although development of one is a high research priority.'""Effective immunity against RSV requires a continuous solid level of antibodies against the virus. There is particular concern for RSV in premature babies because of their lack of maturity and lack of protective antibodies. There is a similar concern about RSV in people of all ages with immunodeficiency. Most people's immune system loses its protective capability a few months following exposure to RSV. This enables individuals to experience repeated episodes of illness during each RSV season."" "
What is the prognosis of an RSV infection?,"'Most babies and toddlers tolerate an RSV infection well. Unless they require supplemental oxygen or are at risk for ''dehydration'', they can receive any necessary respiratory support from their parents in their home. Unfortunately, no current vaccination is available to prevent RSV infection. Hopefully, current research in this area will soon be successful.' "
What is PCR (polymerase chain reaction)?,"'PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a method to analyze a short sequence of DNA (or RNA) even in samples containing only minute quantities of DNA or RNA. PCR is used to reproduce (amplify) selected sections of DNA or RNA. Previously, amplification of DNA involved cloning the segments of interest into vectors for expression in bacteria, and took weeks. But now, with PCR done in test tubes, it takes only a few hours. PCR is highly efficient in that untold numbers of copies can be made of the DNA. Moreover, PCR uses the same molecules that nature uses for copying DNA: ' Two ""primers"", short single-stranded DNA sequences that are synthesized to correspond to the beginning and ending of the DNA stretch to be copied;  An enzyme called polymerase that moves along the segment of DNA, reading its code and assembling a copy; and  A pile of DNA building blocks that the polymerase needs to make that copy."
How is PCR (polymerase chain reaction) done?,"'As illustrated in the ''animated picture of PCR'', three major steps are involved in a PCR. These three steps are repeated for 30 or 40 cycles. The cycles are done on an automated cycler, a device which rapidly heats and cools the test tubes containing the reaction mixture. Each step -- denatauration (alteration of structure), annealing (joining), and extension -- takes place at a different temperature: ''With one cycle, a single segment of double-stranded DNA template is amplified into two separate pieces of double-stranded DNA. These two pieces are then available for amplification in the next cycle. As the cycles are repeated, more and more copies are generated and the number of copies of the template is increased exponentially.' Denaturation: At 94 C (201.2 F), the double-stranded DNA melts and opens into two pieces of single-stranded DNA.  Annealing: At medium temperatures, around 54 C (129.2 F), the primers pair up (anneal) with the single-stranded ""template"" (The template is the sequence of DNA to be copied.) On the small length of double-stranded DNA (the joined primer and template), the polymerase attaches and starts copying the template.  Extension: At 72 C (161.6 F), the polymerase works best, and DNA building blocks complementary to the template are coupled to the primer, making a double stranded DNA molecule."
What is the purpose of doing a PCR (polymerase chain reaction)?,"'To do PCR, the original DNA that one wishes to copy need not be pure or abundant. It can be pure but it also can be a minute part of a mixture of materials. So, PCR has found widespread and innumerable uses -- to diagnose genetic diseases, do DNA fingerprinting, find bacteria and ''viruses'', study human evolution, clone the DNA of an Egyptian mummy, establish paternity or biological relationships, etc.. Accordingly, PCR has become an essential tool for biologists, DNA forensics labs, and many other laboratories that study genetic material.' "
How was PCR (polymerase chain reaction) discovered?,"'PCR was invented by Kary Mullis. At the time he thought up PCR in 1983, Mullis was working in Emeryville, California for Cetus, one of the first biotechnology companies. There, he was charged with making short chains of DNA for other scientists. Mullis has written that he conceived of PCR while cruising along the Pacific Coast Highway 128 one night on his motorcycle. He was playing in his mind with a new way of analyzing changes (mutations) in DNA when he realized that he had instead invented a method of amplifying any DNA region. Mullis has said that before his motorcycle trip was over, he was already savoring the prospects of a Nobel Prize. He shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry with Michael Smith in 1993. ''As Mullis has written in the Scientific American: ""Beginning with a single molecule of the genetic material DNA, the PCR can generate 100 billion similar molecules in an afternoon. The reaction is easy to execute. It requires no more than a test tube, a few simple reagents, and a source of heat."" ' "
What is RT PCR?,"'RT-PCR (Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) is a highly sensitive technique for the detection and quantitation of mRNA (messenger RNA). The technique consists of two parts:''RT-PCR has been used to measure viral load with ''HIV'' and may also be used with other RNA viruses such as ''measles'' and ''mumps''.''Previous contributing author and editor: ''Medical Author: Frederick Hecht, MD, FAAP, FACMG''Medical Editor:  Leslie J.

Introduction to birth control,"'If a woman is sexually active and she is ''fertile'' and physically able to become ''pregnant'', she needs to ask herself, ""Do I want to become pregnant now?"" If her answer is ""No,"" she must use some method of ''birth control'' (''contraception'').''Terminology used to describe ''birth control methods'' includes:''Regardless of the terminology used, sexually active people can choose from a variety of methods to reduce the possibility of their ''becoming pregnant''. No method of ''birth control'' available today offers perfect protection against sexually transmitted diseases or ''STDs'', except abstinence.'""In simple terms, all methods of birth control are based on either preventing a man's sperm from reaching and entering a woman's egg (""'fertilization'"") or preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the woman's uterus (her womb) and starting to grow. New methods of birth control are being developed and tested all the time. What is appropriate for a couple at one point may change with time and circumstances.""'Unfortunately, no birth control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.''Emergency contraception'' is a medication or device that is used to prevent ''conception'' after unprotected intercourse has already occurred. It is not intended for use as a primary method of contraception and is most appropriate as a back-up method. Between 2006 and 2010, about 1 in 9 women of reproductive age in the US report having used emergency contraception. Emergency contraception can involve the administration of hormones or the insertion of an ''intrauterine device'' (''IUD'').' contraception,  pregnancy prevention,  fertility control, and  
family planning.
	"
What is emergency hormonal contraception (morning after pill)?,"'Emergency hormonal contraception is sometimes called ""the morning after pill"" or ""postcoital contraception,"" although these are not the preferred terms, and actually can be misleading. ''It is actually a short course of the hormones found in ''oral contraceptives'' taken at a high dose.'' The exact regimen (the number of pills and the number of days) depends on the type of oral ''contraceptive'' used.'  "
How does the morning after pill work?,"'Depending upon the time during the ''menstrual cycle'' that the emergency contraceptives are taken, these may prevent pregnancy by blocking the implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterus, by inhibiting ''ovulation'', or by interfering with fertilization of the egg. '  To be considered a possible candidate for emergency contraceptive pills a woman should take the medication within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, 
although there is some evidence that they may be effective in the 5 days 
following intercourse.  Because the pills may be taken up to 72 hours later, the 
term ""morning-after pill"" is misleading.  However, the pills are most effective 
when taken as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse. The only known contraindication to emergency contraception is pregnancy, so a woman must not be pregnant when these methods are used. 
	 Emergency hormonal contraception may be taken on any day of the menstrual cycle. 
	"
What are the side effects of the morning after pill?,"'Neither a physical examination nor any laboratory tests are required prior to use of the emergency hormonal contraception. It can be taken at any time during the menstrual cycle, and the next ''menstrual period'' typically occurs within one week of the expected time. The timing of the subsequent menses is, to some extent, dependent upon the time in the cycle at which the emergency contraceptive was taken.' There are no serious side effects, but the pills may cause 
	nausea and vomiting in some women. 
	 These side effects may be controlled by taking an 
	anti-nausea drug such as dimenhydrinate (Dramamine). 
	 Frequently a doctor will give a prescription nausea medication, such as 
	prochlorperazine (Compazine), at the same time as the emergency contraceptive pill. 
	 A woman may also experience breast tenderness and a temporary disruption of her menstrual cycle. One type of emergency hormonal contraception is available without a prescription in the US for people aged 17 or older (proof of ID is required for purchase). 
	 It is also available for younger
	teens with parental permission."
"What is the dosage, and what types of the morning after pill are available?","'The most common type of emergency hormonal contraception involves the administration of the ''progesterone'' hormone ''levonorgestrel'' in two doses (marketed as ''Plan B'' in the U.S.).''Another formulation for emergency hormonal contraception uses estrogen along with levonorgestrel, but levonorgestrel-only medication may be more effective and causes less nausea compared to estrogen-containing products.''Clinical trials'' using low doses of ''mifepristone'' (known earlier as RU-486, sometimes called ""the abortion pill"") have shown that this agent is extremely effective as an emergency contraceptive when taken prior to ovulation, but it has not been approved for this use in the US. Mifepristone (''Mifeprex'"") has been approved, in much higher doses, for terminating a pregnancy of less than 49 days' duration and must be taken under a physician's supervision.""'Another type of anti-progestin medication that is similar to mifepristone in its structure and actions is known as ulipristal acetate. Ulipristal acetate (Ella) is marketed for emergency contraception in Europe and was approved by the US FDA in August 2010 for use in the US for emergency contraception up to 120 hours after intercourse. It is available by prescription only.''Although effectiveness of the oral contraceptives are dependent to some extent upon how soon after unprotected intercourse they are taken, efficacy studies have generally reported a low rate of pregnancy with use of oral emergency contraception.''Emergency contraceptive pills do not protect women from ''sexually transmitted diseases'' (''STDs'').''Emergency hormonal contraception or the morning after pill is not meant to be a primary birth control method. Once the emergency is over, a woman should receive proper counseling so that she can select an effective and appropriate contraceptive method to use on a regular basis if she continues to be sexually active.' "
What is emergency IUD?,"'Like the high dose of oral hormonal contraceptive, an IUD blocks the implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterine wall. \tEmergency IUD insertion can also be used to prevent a pregnancy after unprotected sex. \t''An added advantage of emergency contraceptive use of an IUD compared to pills is that once the IUD is in place, it will provide the woman with a long-term contraceptive method if she chooses.'  Copper IUD insertion is the most effective method of emergency contraception. 
	 If the copper IUD (Paragard) is inserted within 5 days after unprotected sex, it is 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. 
	 The copper IUD has the lowest failure rate of all emergency contraception options. Emergency IUD insertion does slightly increase the risk of 
	pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). 
	 Contraindications to the use of the emergency IUD include:
known or suspected pregnancy, 
active pelvic infection, 
copper allergy, and 
certain anatomical abnormalities of the uterus.

What is heat rash?,"""The skin's job is to protect the inside of the body from the outside world. It acts as a preventive barrier against intruders that cause infection, chemicals, or ultraviolet light from invading or damaging the body. It also plays an important role in the body's temperature control. One way that the body cools itself is by ""'sweating'', and allowing that sweat or ''perspiration'' to evaporate. Sweat is manufactured in sweat glands that line the entire body (except for a few small spots like fingernails, toenails, and the ear canal).''Sweat glands are located in the dermis or deep layer of the skin, and are regulated by the temperature control centers in the brain. Sweat from the gland gets to the surface of the skin by a duct.'""A heat rash occurs when sweat ducts become clogged and the sweat cannot get to the surface of the skin. Instead, it becomes trapped beneath the skin's surface causing a mild inflammation or rash.""'Heat rash is also called prickly heat or miliaria.'  "
What are the causes of heat rash?,"'It is uncertain why some people get heat ''rashes'"" and others don't.""'The sweat gland ducts can become blocked if ''excessive sweating'' occurs, and that sweat is not allowed to evaporate from a specific area. Some examples of how blockage may occur include the following:''Babies'"" have immature sweat glands that aren't able to efficiently remove the sweat they produce. They can develop heat rash if they are exposed to warm weather, are overdressed, excessively bundled, or have a ""'fever''.''Heat rash may occur as a side effect of some medications (for example ''clonidine'' [''Catapres'']).'   Creases in the skin like the neck, armpit, or groin have skin touching adjacent skin, which makes it difficult for air to circulate, and prevents sweat evaporation. Tight clothing that prevents sweat evaporation. Bundling up in heavy clothing or sheets. This may occur when a person tries to keep warm in wintertime or when chilled because of an illness with fever. Heavy creams or lotions can clog sweat ducts."
What are the symptoms of heat rash in children and adults?,"'The common symptoms of heat rash are red ''bumps'' on the skin, and an ''itchy'' or prickly feeling to the skin. These are due to inflammation of the superficial layers of the skin (the ''epidermis'') and the prickly sensation is similar to the feeling of mild ''sunburn''.''The symptoms of heat rash are the same in infants and adults; however, since an infant cannot complain about the rash sensation, he or she may be fussy.'  "
Who is at risk for heat rash?,"'Newborns, infants, the elderly, and ''obese'' individuals with large areas with skin-on-skin contact areas (for example, a large overlapping area of ''abdominal fat'') are at risk for developing heat rash. They all are especially at risk if they are immobile for long periods and parts of the skin aren\'t exposed to circulating air, which results in the inability of the sweat ducts to ""breathe"" (evaporative cooling).''Heat ''rashes'' are more common in places with hot, humid, climates because people sweat more.''Intense ''exercise'' associated with lots of ''sweating'' may cause a heat rash, especially if the clothing worn does not allow adequate air circulation.' "
What does heat rash look like?,"'The appearance of the heat rash depends upon where the excess sweat is deposited in the skin.''Tiny blisters that look like small beads of sweat are seen if the sweat is blocked at the most superficial layers of the skin where the sweat duct opens on the skin surface. Called ''miliaria crystallina'', it has no symptoms other than these ""sweat bubbles.""''Classic heat rash or ''miliaria rubra'"" occurs if the sweat causes inflammation in the deeper layers of the epidermis. Like any other inflammation, the area becomes red (and therefore the name rubra = red) and the blisters become slightly larger. Because the sweat ducts are blocked and don't deliver sweat to the skin's surface, the area involved is dry and can be irritated, itchy, and sore. This rash is also called ""'prickly heat''.''Less commonly, after repeated episodes of prickly heat, the heat rash may inflame the deeper layer of the skin called the dermis, and cause ''miliaria profunda''. This rash is made up of larger, harder bumps that are more skin colored. The rash begins almost immediately after ''exercise'', and again no sweat can be found on the affected areas. Rarely, this type of heat rash may be potentially dangerous if enough skin is involved, since the lack of sweating can lead to heat-related illnesses like ''heat cramps'', ''heat exhaustion'', or ''heat stroke''.' "

How is heat rash diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of heat rash is made by physical examination. Knowing that the rash appears during sweating or heat, appreciating the location on the body (in skin creases or where clothes fit tightly) and seeing what the rash looks like is enough to make the diagnosis. As with many rashes, the health care professional may look at the involved skin and because of previous experience, immediately make the diagnosis.' "
What is the treatment for heat rash?,'Treatment for heat rash include home remedies such as ''over-the-counter'' creams and sprays. Medical treatment for heat rash may involve antibiotics if the sweat glands become infected.'  
Home remedies for heat rash,"'Heat rash often resolves on its own when the skin cools. If the prickly sensation persists, ''calamine lotion'' may be helpful. Some clinicians also recommend over-the-counter hydrocortisone creams or sprays.'  "
Medical treatment for heat rash,"'Heat rash resolves on its own once the skin cools, but on occasion, the sweat glands can become infected. The signs of infection include ''pain'', increased swelling, and redness that does not resolve. Pustules may form at the site of the rash. This infection occurs because bacteria have invaded the blocked sweat gland. Antibiotic treatment may be required. Chronic and recurrent heat rash may need to be treated by a health care professional or dermatologist (skin specialist).' "
How can heat rash be prevented?,"'Prevention'' is the most important treatment for heat rash. By allowing the skin to be exposed to circulating air, the potential for sweat ducts to become blocked and the glands to become inflamed decreases.''Other strategies to prevent heat rash include:' Avoid exercising in hot, humid weather Wear loose clothing made of breathable fabrics like cotton Use air conditioning Keep the skin clean with frequent baths or showers to prevent sweat glands from becoming clogged Reduce the amount of overlapping skin-on-skin (fat or weight loss)"
How effective are electric fans in preventing heat rash?,"'Keeping the skin cool on hot days is an important preventive measure. Air circulation (with fans or by other methods) usually will help with skin cooling. It is important not to bundle newborns and infants too tightly so that air can get to the skin, but it also is important to keep them warm enough.''It is important to move individuals who are immobile (for example, some elderly, those with ''paralysis'', or are weak) so all parts of the body can be exposed to fresh air.' "
How can people protect their health when temperatures are extremely high?,"'The body can adapt very well in hot weather, but it takes time to acclimate. The actual temperature is just one factor when a person decides to work, play, or exercise in the heat. The ''heat index ''adds humidity to the equation since sweat cannot evaporate if the water content in the air (humidity) is high. If the air holds as much water as it can there is no place for sweat to go, and evaporation cannot cool the body.''To minimize the risk of heat-related illnesses, try to avoid working or exercising in extreme heat. Avoid ''dehydration'' and other complications by taking frequent breaks to get out of the heat, and drinking plenty of water or other fluids to replenish fluid lost through sweat.''Early signs of heat-related illnesses include ''lightheadedness'', ''weakness'', and ''nausea''. It is important to get out of the heat, cool off, and rehydrate immediately to avoid severe heat-related problems such as heat exhaustion and heat ''stroke''.'""To calculate the heat index in your area,\xa0 go to the U.S. Army's Heat Index Calculator online."" "
How much water should I drink in hot weather?,"'It is hard to gauge how much water is lost through sweat, and the ''thirst'' mechanism may not be sensitive enough to remind a person to drink enough. In general, the kidneys are a good guide to whether there is enough water in the body. If the body is dehydrated, the kidneys will try to hold on to as much water as possible. Decreased urine production, urine concentrated in color, and a strong ''urine odor'"" are signs that the kidneys are trying to conserve the body's water supply. Urine is clear when there is enough fluid in the body.""'In a hot environment, a person should drink enough water to make the urine clear, and make sure the body is producing sweat. Sweat and urine loss also involves ''electrolyte'' loss. Although drinking water is good, other fluids such as sports ''drinks'' should also be consumed to replace lost ''electrolytes'' to avoid other problems like ''hypokalemia'' (''low potassium''). People that are taking medications for conditions such as ''diabetes'', kidney problems, and ''congestive heart failure'' (''CHF'') need to be especially careful about their fluid intake, and discuss how to avoid hot-weather related problems with their doctor(s).' "
Should I take salt tablets during hot weather?,"'Taking salt tablets is not a good idea. While the body loses many electrolytes when it sweats, there are mechanisms in place to compensate for the loss. Usually, keeping the body hydrated with plain water is adequate but does not resupply electrolytes. Sports drinks (for example, PowerAde, Gatorade) may be reasonable alternatives if prolonged exercise or work is required in hot conditions.' "
What is the best clothing for hot weather or a heat wave?,"""Evaporation works to cool the skin only if the sweat that the body produces is allowed to evaporate. Lightweight, loose clothing allows air circulation to the body's surface and helps promote cooling. While cotton is the classic fabric that can be used, some synthetic fabrics have been developed to wick sweat from the skin, which allows the skin to be more efficient at skin or body cooling."" "
What is the prognosis for heat rash?,"'Heat rash or prickly heat tends to be selflimiting, and gets better once the skin cools and is allowed to breathe. Prevention by not allowing heat to accumulate in body areas, followed by cooling the skin are the most common ways to obtain the best prognosis for heat rash.' "
Introduction to Male Condoms,"'Birth control'' is a way for men and women to prevent ''pregnancy''. There are many different methods of ''birth control''; some types also protect against ''sexually transmitted diseases''. Condoms are one type of birth control that in addition to preventing pregnancy also prevent the spread of ''STDs''.''There are two types of condoms, the ''male condom'' and the female ''condom''.' "
What Is a Male Condom?,"'The male condom, or ""rubber,"" is a thin covering made of latex, ''plastic'"", or animal membrane that is rolled over an erect penis. The covering prevents semen, the fluid that contains sperm, from entering a woman's vagina."" "
What Are Male Condoms Made of?,"'Most condoms are made of a type of rubber called ""latex."" Latex condoms are the most effective condom at preventing ''STDs''. Recently, condoms made of polyurethane (a type of plastic) have become available. These are more expensive than latex condoms and seem to break more easily. They are mainly useful for people who are ''allergic'' to latex. There are also ""natural"" condoms, which are made of animal membranes (lambskin). These are expensive and although they are effective at preventing pregnancy they do not decrease the spread of many sexually transmitted diseases.' "
What Types of Latex Condoms Are There?,"'Condoms come in all shapes, sizes, and materials. Here are some characteristics to consider when buying condoms.' Size. The standard size will fit most men. Extra-large condoms are available, as well as ""snug"" sizes that are a little smaller and fit tighter than the standard size. Shape. Some condoms come with a nipple in the end to hold the fluid when the man ejaculates. Others have a rounded end. Thickness. Extra-strength condoms are available. These are stronger and are especially useful for rectal sex and for men who have problems with condom breakage. Extra thin condoms also are available, but these are not recommended because they may break more easily. Lubrication. Many condoms come pre-lubricated. This lubrication can be a substance that kills sperm (spermicide) and many disease-causing germs. Lubrication may give some extra protection in preventing pregnancy, especially if the condom breaks. Lubricated condoms taste bad and are not recommended for oral sex. Flavored. These condoms are meant for the male to wear when receiving oral sex. They are not lubricated and have a mild flavor (usually mint). Color. Condoms come in many colors. The color of the condom doesn't make it any more or less effective."
When Should a Man Use a Condom?,"'Take caution when opening the wrapper to avoid tearing the condom with your ''teeth'', fingernails or rings. Gently pinch the air out of the tip of the condom before putting it on. The condom is rolled over the erect penis before sexual activity begins. If the condom does not have a built-in nipple, leave about 1/2-inch of the condom free at the tip of the penis so that semen has a place to collect.''A new condom must be used each time you have sex. The condom must be in place before the penis gets near the vagina. If you use lubricants with a condom, be sure to only use water-based lubricants, such as K-Y Jelly. Oil-based lubricants, such as Vaseline, ''massage'' oils and body lotions can cause condoms to leak or break. Certain vaginal medications used to treat yeast infections can also weaken condoms.''Initially it was felt that condoms lubricated with spermicidal agents offered more protection against STDs. Newer studies show that frequent use of condoms containing ''spermicides'' offers no additional protection and it may actually increase the risk of a href=""https://www.medicinenet.com/human_immunodeficiency_virus_hiv/article.htm"">''HIV'' and other STDs by irritating the vagina and penis. Spermicidal products do however remain useful in pregnancy ''prevention''.' "

What Causes Male Condoms to Break?,"'There are several reasons why a condom would break:' Condoms too old. Modern condom wrappers have a date after which the condom should not be used. Improper storage. Heat damages latex condoms, so they should not be kept in a hot place, such as a car glove compartment or wallet. Not enough lubrication. Additional lubrication is always needed for rectal sex. It may also be needed for vaginal sex. The lubricant should be water-soluble, such as KY jelly. The wrong kind of lubricant. Lubricants that contain oil -- such as Vaseline, baby oils and vegetable oils -- should not be used with latex condoms since they weaken the rubber. Condom too small. Try a larger size. Partner too tight. Use an extra strength condom and more lubricant."
What Causes Condoms to Come Off During Sex?,"'A condom may come off during sex because:' Condom too large. Try a snug condom. Loss of erection. Remove your penis, holding on to the rolled edge of the condom, as soon as you begin to lose your erection."
Where Can I Get Male Condoms?,'Condoms can be purchased at most drug stores. Condoms also are sold in some vending machines in public restrooms.' 
How Effective Are Male Condoms at Preventing Pregnancy?,"'Condoms are about 85 % effective. With careful use, they are even more effective. Keep in mind that the best way to avoid ''getting pregnant'' is to not have sex (abstinence).' "
How Do Male Condoms Prevent STDs?,"'Latex condoms provide protection from sexually transmitted diseases by preventing the infected area from coming into contact with the partner. Polyurethane condoms provide some protection, although not as much as latex. Natural or lambskin condoms do not protect against STDs because they have larger holes or ""pores"" that allow the small particles that can cause some STDs to pass through.' "
Should Foam be Used With Male Condoms?,"'Contraceptive'' foam can offer added protection against pregnancy in case a condom breaks. Frequent use of spermicides can irritate the genital tissues and may increase the risk of STDs, including ''HIV/AIDS''.' "
How Effective Are Foam and Male Condoms?,"'When used together and properly, foam and condoms are about 97% effective in preventing pregnancy.' "
What Is a Female Condom?,'The female condom is a lubricated polyurethane (plastic) tube that has a flexible ring at each end. One end of the tube is closed.' 
How Is the Female Condom Used?,"'Before sexual activity begins, the woman inserts the condom into her vagina so that the closed end of the tube covers the cervix, and the other end slightly covers the labia (lips on the outside of the vagina). The condom blocks sperm from entering the womb. Female condoms should be discarded after one use.' "
Where Can I Get Female Condoms?,"'Like the male condom, the female condom is available at drug stores without a prescription.' "
How Effective Is the Female Condom at Preventing Pregnancy?,'The female condom is about 75% effective.' 
Do Female Condoms Protect Against STDs?,"'Female condoms provide some protection against sexually transmitted diseases, but the male condom provides the best protection if you have sex. Female condoms should not be used in combination with male condoms. The friction of the two could result in product failure.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
About rubella,"'Rubella'', sometimes called German ''measles'' or three-day ''measles'', is a ''contagious'' disease caused by a virus. The infection is usually mild with ''fever'' and ''rash''.' "
Symptoms,"'Rubella'' usually causes the following symptoms in children:''These symptoms last 2 or 3 days.''Older children and adults may also have swollen glands and symptoms like a ''cold'' before the rash appears. Aching joints occur in many cases, especially among young women.''About half of the people who get ''rubella'' do not have symptoms.'   Rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body Low fever (less than 101 degrees)"
Complications,"'Birth defects'' if acquired by a ''pregnant'' woman: deafness, ''cataracts'', ''heart'' defects, mental retardation, and ''liver'' and spleen damage (at least a 20% chance of damage to the fetus if a woman is infected early in ''pregnancy'').' "
Transmission,"'Spread by contact with an infected person, through ''coughing'' and ''sneezing''.' "
Prevention,'Rubella ''vaccine'' (contained in MMR vaccine) can prevent this disease.' 
Does my child need this vaccine?,"'Children should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine:''These are the recommended ages. But children can get the second dose at any age, as long as it is at least 28 days after the first dose.' The first dose at 12-15 months of age The second dose at 4-6 years of age"
"As an adult, do I need this vaccine?","'You do NOT need the measles, ''mumps'', rubella vaccine (MMR) if:''You SHOULD get the measles vaccine if you are not among the categories listed above, and' You had blood tests that show you are immune to measles, mumps, and rubella. You are a man born before 1957. You are a woman born before 1957 who is sure she is not having more children, has already had rubella vaccine, or has had a positive rubella test. You already had two doses of MMR or one dose of MMR plus a second dose of measles vaccine. You already had one dose of MMR and are not at high risk of measles or mumps exposure. You are a college student, trade school student, or other student beyond high school. You work in a hospital or other medical facility. You travel internationally, or are a passenger on a cruise ship. You are a woman of childbearing age."
What is measles? What does measles look like?,"'Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can be fatal. In most people, the disease produces fever (temperature > 101 F [38.3 C]), a generalized ''rash'' that lasts greater than 3 days, ''cough'', runny nose (coryza), and ''red eyes'' (''conjunctivitis''). The complications of measles that result in most deaths include ''pneumonia'' and inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).'  "
What is rubeola? What is rubella? What are other names for measles?,"'Rubeola'' is the scientific name used for measles. People often confuse rubeola with ''rubella'' (''German measles'').''Rubella'' is the scientific name used of German measles, a different viral illness. While German measles is rarely fatal, it is dangerous in that infection of pregnant women causes ''birth defects'' and can cause ''miscarriage'' and fetal death.''Other terms describe measles. These include (erroneously) ''rubella'', hard measles, red measles, 7-day measles, 8-day measles, 9-day measles, 10-day measles, and morbilli.' "
What is the history of measles and vaccines?,"'People have described cases of measles as early as the seventh century. However, it was not until 1963 that researchers first developed a vaccine to prevent measles. Before the vaccine was available, the measles virus infected almost every child because it spreads so easily. Before routine vaccination, there were approximately 3-4 million cases of measles and 500 deaths due to measles each year in the United States.''There were initially two types of ''vaccines'' developed against measles. Researchers developed one from a killed virus, and they developed the other using a live measles virus that was weakened (attenuated) and could no longer cause the disease. Unfortunately, the killed measles virus (KMV) vaccine was not effective in preventing people from getting the disease, and medical professionals discontinued its use in 1967. The live virus vaccine has been modified a number of times to make it safer (further attenuated) and today is extremely effective in preventing the disease. The currently used vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine.' "
Is measles contagious?,"'Measles is a highly contagious viral illness that spreads easily from person to person, especially in those without previous vaccination. The pathogen responsible for measles is the rubeola virus.' "
What is the contagious period for measles?,'The infected person is highly contagious for 4 days before the ''rash'' appears until 4 days after the rash appears. The measles virus can remain in the air (and still be able to cause disease) for up to 2 hours after an infected person has left a room.' 
What causes measles? How does measles spread?,"'The measles virus (rubeola virus, a paramyxovirus, genus ''Morbillivirus'') causes measles.''Measles spreads through droplet transmission from the nose, throat, and mouth of someone infected with the virus. These droplets spray out when the infected person ''coughs'' or sneezes. Among unimmunized people exposed to the virus, over 90% will contract the disease.' "
How does one become immune to measles?,"'Anyone who has had measles is immune for life. People who have received two doses of vaccine after their first birthday have a 98% likelihood of being immune. Infants receive some immunity from their mother. Unfortunately, this immunity is not complete, and infants are at increased risk for infection until they receive the first dose of vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age. Children receive the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age.' "
What are measles symptoms and signs?,"'A typical case of measles actually starts with a''After 2 to 4 days of these symptoms, the patient may develop spots within the mouth called Koplik spots. These spots look like little grains of white or bluish-white sand surrounded by a red ring and are usually found inside the cheek toward the back of the mouth (opposite the first and second upper molars).''The skin rash (also known as an exanthem or exanthema) appears 3 to 5 days after the onset of the initial symptoms (fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes). The rash is a flat to slightly raised (maculopapular) red rash that usually last 5 to 6 days. It begins at the hairline and then progresses to the face and upper neck. Over the next 2 to 3 days, the rash progresses downward to cover the entire body, including the hands and ''feet''. The rash has mostly distinct lesions, but some may overlap (become confluent). Initially, these lesions will turn white when you press on them (blanch). After 3 to 4 days, they no longer will blanch. As the rash begins to fade, there will often be a fine flaking of the skin (desquamation). The rash fades in the same order that it appears.''The fever that occurs with measles is called a stepwise fever. The patient starts with a mild fever that progressively gets higher. ''Fevers'' often reach temperatures greater than 103 F (39.4 C).''Although not as common as other symptoms, some patients may have a ''sore throat''.'   fever, runny nose, hacking cough, and red eyes (conjunctivitis)."
Who is at risk for getting measles?,"'Those people at high risk for measles include' children less than 1 year of age (although they have some immunity passed from their mother, it is not 100% effective); people who have not received the proper vaccination series; people who received immunoglobulin at the time of measles vaccination; people immunized from 1963 until 1967 with an older ineffective killed measles vaccine."
Is measles deadly?,"'While measles can be fatal, it has rarely been fatal for the last 20 years in the United States. However, in 2016, 89,000 children died worldwide due to measles. About one in 500 to one in 1,000 people who contract measles will die. The low rate of death in the U.S. is because most people received immunizations, which resulted in very infrequent outbreaks. However, with increasing numbers of people who refuse vaccination in the U.S., there are likely going to be more complications and deaths from measles in the future. The people most likely to have complications (including death) are those who are malnourished or who have weakened immune systems.' "
What is the danger of getting measles while pregnant?,"'If a woman contracts measles while she is pregnant, she may have a miscarriage, a ''stillbirth'', or a preterm delivery. The infant can also be born with measles infection. There appears to be no risk of having birth defects (unlike an infection with the ''rubella'' virus, known as German measles).' "
What is the incubation period for measles?,'The typical time from exposure to a person infected with measles to development of the initial symptoms (incubation period) is 10-12 days (the range is 7 to 21 days). The rash occurs a few days after the initial symptoms (ranges from 7 to 18 days from exposure).' 
What is atypical measles?,"'Atypical measles occurs in people who received the killed measles vaccine (KMV; only used from 1963 until 1967) and who have an exposure to wild-type measles virus. The KMV unfortunately sensitizes the patient to the measles virus but does not offer any protection. The disease is characterized by fever, pleural effusions, ''pneumonia'', and swelling of the extremities. The rash of atypical measles is different from measles in that it may have an urticarial component (''hives'') and usually appears first on the ankles and wrists.''The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends that people who may have received the KMV should receive revaccination with the live measles vaccine.' "
What is modified measles?,"'Modified measles appears in patients who, because they were unimmunized, received immune globulin after exposure to a patient with measles. It also appears occasionally in young infants who have limited immunity from their mothers. The immune globulin prolongs the time from exposure to onset of symptoms (incubation period). When the symptoms do occur, they are much milder than those seen with normal measles and tend to last a shorter period of time.' "
What types of doctors treat measles?,"'Any physician (including primary care physicians and pediatricians) can treat measles; however, most times there will be an infectious disease doctor consulted to be sure that the diagnosis is correct. Sometimes a general practitioner may consult a dermatologist, as well. Many physicians in current practice have never seen a case of measles, which makes it more difficult for them to diagnose it. If the patient has pneumonia or encephalitis, they may be in the intensive care unit and treated by critical care physicians.' "
How do medical professionals make a diagnosis of measles?,"'The diagnosis of suspected measles is mostly clinical, meaning that the appearance and history of the patient suggest the diagnosis. In a person with known exposure to someone with measles or travel to a foreign country, health care providers should always consider measles when faced with a patient who has a high fever and characteristic rash. Until the rash appears, the presence of Koplik spots should help to suggest the diagnosis. Most cases of suspected measles in the United States turn out not to be measles (see below). It is recommended that the diagnosis be confirmed using a blood test for IgM, a type of antibody against the virus. If the IgM test is positive, medical professionals should obtain viral cultures. Contact the state and local health department immediately for any suspected case in order to follow the correct procedures for viral culture and isolation of the patient. Further information on laboratory testing of suspected measles cases is available from the CDC (''http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt07-measles.html'').' "
"If it is not measles, what else could it be?","'There are many infectious diseases and other conditions that can cause some of the ''symptoms of measles''. These include, but are not limited to, ''dengue fever'', drug reactions, enteroviral infections, ''fifth disease'', German measles (rubella), ''Kawasaki disease'', ''Rocky Mountain spotted fever'', ''roseola'', and ''toxic shock syndrome''. It is important that a medical expert see suspected measles cases and order appropriate laboratory tests.' "
What should someone do if he or she has been exposed to measles?,"'People who have been appropriately vaccinated (or who have had the disease) and who are exposed to a patient with measles do not need to do anything. If an unimmunized person is exposed to a patient with measles, they should receive the vaccine as soon as possible. This may prevent the disease if given within 72 hours of exposure. Immune globulin may have some benefit if given within 6 days of exposure. The CDC recommends that household contacts of infected people, immunocompromised people, and pregnant women receive immune globulin. It is not recommended that health care professionals use immune globulin to control a measles outbreak.' "
Is there any treatment for measles after symptoms and signs develop?,"'The treatment of patients with measles focuses on symptom relief.'   Specific complications like pneumonia may require antibiotics. Home remedies are simply symptomatic treatment with acetaminophen (Tylenol), lots of rest, and fluids. Patients should be on bed rest until the fever has resolved and should remain well hydrated. In malnourished patients, doctors recommend vitamin A supplementation. Patients should be isolated to prevent spread of the disease."
What are complications seen with measles?,"'Some cases of measles have an associated complication. These complications can include ''diarrhea'', middle ''ear infections'', pneumonia, ''blindness'', acute brain inflammation (encephalitis, which is very rare), and persistent brain inflammation (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis or SSPE, which is extremely rare).''Blindness associated with measles is due to a combination of poor ''nutrition'' (specifically vitamin A deficiency) and the measles infection. Prevention is the most effective treatment. In third-world countries, post-measles blindness is the leading cause of blindness.''Acute encephalitis, although rare, is extremely dangerous and results in death in a significant percentage of patients who develop it. When it occurs, acute encephalitis generally starts 6 days after onset of the rash. Symptoms can include fever, ''headache'', ''vomiting'', ''stiff neck'', drowsiness, ''seizures'', and ''coma''.''Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is an extremely rare degenerative condition of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). A chronic infection of the central nervous system with the measles virus causes SSPE. Typically, symptoms start years after the patient had measles (average seven years, range 1 month to 27 years). The patient has a slow and progressive loss of brain function, ''seizures'', and eventually death results. There is no known treatment for SSPE.''Most deaths from measles are due to pneumonia in children and encephalitis in adults. The people most likely to have complications (including death) are those who are malnourished or who have weakened immune systems (for example, people with ''AIDS'' or other conditions that weaken the immune system).' "
Is it possible to prevent measles with a vaccine? How effective is the measles vaccine?,"'The only way to prevent measles is by receiving measles immunization: This is commonly given as a two-shot series that contains measles, ''mumps'', and rubella vaccine (MMR) or a shot containing measles, mumps, rubella, and ''varicella'' (''chickenpox'') vaccine (MMRV). Health care professionals do not recommend the MMRV for anyone older than 12 years of age. The current recommendation is that everyone receive two doses of the vaccine after 1 year of age. If a person receives the vaccine before 1 year of age, the person should receive two additional doses.''The measles-containing ''vaccines'' (MMR and MMRV) are not 100% effective, and this is why it is critical that everyone receives an immunization. When people skip ''vaccinations'', they put others at risk. This is why most states have laws requiring vaccination. Unfortunately, many states allow people to refuse vaccination based on varying criteria. Due to a sharp increase in the number of cases of measles in 2014 and 2015, there has been a renewed urgency to require immunization for everyone.''No vaccine is 100% effective. In 2012, the Cochrane Collaboration estimated that one dose of MMR would protect prevent 92% of secondary measles cases (a case caused by exposure to another person with the disease), and two doses would be 95% effective. However, if most of the population is immunized (known as herd immunity), the effectiveness of the vaccine is markedly increased. When under-vaccinated groups of close-knit communities are exposed to a single individual with measles, an outbreak can develop very quickly, as occurred in 2019.''The measles vaccine is also available as a single vaccine. However, in most cases, there is no reason to utilize the measles vaccine alone without mumps and rubella vaccine. The complete schedule of recommended vaccinations is available from the CDC (''http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html'').' "
What is the prognosis for measles?,"'Most people who contract measles will recover completely. Very few people who get measles will die. People who are malnourished or immunocompromised are more likely to have complications or die. However, it is possible for any person to die from the measles, which highlights the importance of vaccination. Almost no one who has been vaccinated has died from the disease.' "
Why should people get the measles vaccine?,"'Although measles was extremely rare in the United States in the 1990s and early 2000s, recently, there has been a marked increased number of cases.''When the number of vaccinated individuals starts to decrease, the disease starts to occur more frequently. This occurred from 1989 until 1991 in the U.S. During that period, there were 55,000 cases and 123 deaths from measles in the U.S. Due to a massive public health effort, almost all children in the U.S. received the measles vaccine before entering school. The number of cases of measles in the U.S. dropped to only 37 in 2004. At that time, most cases originated outside of the U.S. These cases came from three common sources: infants being adopted from China, U.S. ''travelers'' being exposed while out of the country (now most commonly from European travel), and from foreign ''travelers'' visiting the U.S.''However, in 2011, the number of cases grew to 222 because more people avoided vaccinations. Fortunately, there were no deaths among those 222. In 2014, the number of cases jumped dramatically to 644 cases, and there were 14 separate outbreaks. The largest outbreak was due to many unvaccinated children and adults in an Amish community in Ohio. A large multistate outbreak of measles started in December 2014 at Disneyland in California and continued into 2015. There were 48 cases of measles in 13 states in the first half of 2016. Most of the recent outbreaks traced back to individuals who refused vaccination and had foreign travel prior to onset of the illness. In 2018, an outbreak in New York City resulted in 58 cases and cost the health department over $400,000.''Many states allow people to refuse vaccination for religious reasons (although no organized religion prohibits vaccination) and 17 states allow parents to refuse vaccinations for philosophical reasons. The only way to prevent this problem is to change laws so that parents can no longer refuse vaccination except for documented ''allergy'' to vaccine components. Many states have up to 40% of preschoolers without proper vaccinations.' "
Why is the U.S. measles outbreak of 2019 so concerning?,"'The ongoing 2019 outbreak in the U.S. reported 1,203 measles cases in 30 states as of Aug. 15, 2019. This is the largest outbreak in over 28 years. Of the 1,203 measles cases, most were in unvaccinated people. The largest number of cases occurred in New York state, followed by Washington state. Close-knit communities accounted for most of cases. Since Aug. 19, 2019, there have been 654 measles cases in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg, Queens, and Borough Park, and there were 296 cases in the northern suburb of Rockland County as of Aug. 15, 2019. This led health officials to mandate immunizations, and those who refuse vaccinations could face arrest. The cost of the current outbreak has already cost millions of dollars, and economists estimate the cost could be more than $40 million by the time they contain the outbreak.' "
Why do some Orthodox Jews refuse vaccination?,"'In the most recent 2019 outbreak of measles in New York City, the hardest hit areas were in Ultra-Orthodox Jews from Brooklyn. While these people claim that Jewish law prohibits vaccination, many Jewish scholars have refuted that claim. The issue is apparently one of personal freedom more than religion. According to the CDC Vaccine Director Nancy Messonnier, outbreaks occur when unvaccinated people travel abroad to countries (like Israel) where there is widespread transmission of measles. The person becomes infected and returns to the United States. The concern is that these reckless actions could result in measles getting a foothold again here in the United States.' "
Does the Church of Scientology oppose vaccinations?,"'The Church of Scientology does not have an official policy against vaccinations or medical care in general. In April 2019, health officials quarantined a Church-owned cruise ship in the Caribbean nation of St. Lucia because one of the passengers developed measles.' "
What can I do if I have not received the vaccine and I am exposed to a person with measles?,"'If a person is exposed to measles, a few steps can help prevent getting the disease. This is known as post-exposure prophylaxis. If the exposure to measles has been within 3 days, the recommended course of action is immunization with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) or the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine. If it has been more than 72 hours, but less than 6 days, the person can receive immunoglobulin. These are not guaranteed to prevent measles, but it can decrease the likelihood of the illness.' "
Is there any truth to the fear of getting autism from the MMR or MMRV?,"'There is no valid scientific evidence that the measles vaccine, or any other vaccine, is the cause of ''autism''. Andrew Wakefield and colleagues proposed the possibility of an association between the measles vaccine and ''autism'' in 1998. The research published by Wakefield was found to be flawed and actually forged, and the results have not been able to be repeated by other researchers. ''The Lancet'', which published the original research in 1998, retracted the research publication in 2010. Since 1998, there have been numerous studies that have examined such an association. None of these studies have shown any risk of ''autism'' associated with the use of the vaccine. A recent study performed in Japan after the MMR vaccine was removed from the market showed that autism continued to increase after the vaccine was no longer being utilized. A recent study in Denmark showed that there was no increase in autism among vaccinated children. Although autism is a very serious disease that warrants good research to find out its many causes, not obtaining vaccinations is potentially dangerous and not supported by the best scientific data available today.' "
Who should not receive measles vaccinations?,"'The following groups of people should not receive measles vaccinations:''Patients with history of thrombocytopenic purpura or ''thrombocytopenia'' (low platelets) may be at increased risk, and immunization should be decided on a case-by-case basis.' People who have suffered a severe allergic reaction to either the measles vaccine or its components (gelatin or neomycin) should not receive the vaccine. Women known to be pregnant should not receive the vaccine. Avoid pregnancy for four weeks after vaccination. Severely immunocompromised patients (cancer patients or patients who are receiving large doses of corticosteroids) should not receive the vaccine. However, those leukemia patients who have been in remission for three months may receive the MMR. Patients with severe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections should not receive the vaccine. However, it is safe for asymptomatic patients with HIV to receive vaccinations. The CDC has issued guidelines for vaccination based on the CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. People with a moderate to severe acute illness should wait until their illness resolves before receiving the vaccine."
"Do people need to be revaccinated against measles if they are traveling to Europe 
and Israel?","'Europe and Israel have been experiencing recent epidemics of measles. This is likely due to poor vaccination rates in many European countries and Israel. It is not currently recommended to revaccinate people who have received at least two doses of the MMR vaccine. However, U.S. travelers should make sure that they have received at least two vaccinations against measles (MMR) prior to visiting any country outside of the United States.' "
What adverse reactions or side effects can occur with the measles vaccination?,"'Adverse reactions to measles vaccination (as part of the MMR) include fever, rash, joint aches, and ''low platelet count'' (thrombocytopenia). Some adult women will suffer ''joint pain'' that is due to the rubella component of the vaccine. The fever usually occurs 7 to 12 days after the vaccination, and the rash occurs 7 to 10 days after vaccination.'  "
"If a child has an egg allergy, can they still receive the measles vaccine?","'Although the measles vaccine is made using chick embryos, there is no evidence of increased reactions in people with an egg ''allergy''. Therefore, the CDC recommends giving MMR vaccine to egg-''allergic'' children without any prior skin testing or the use of special protocols.' "
"Who should be revaccinated 
(receive a booster shot) against measles?",'The following group of people should be considered unvaccinated and should receive at least one dose of vaccine:' People vaccinated before their first birthday should be revaccinated. Anyone known to have been vaccinated with the killed measles vaccine (KMV) should be revaccinated. Anyone vaccinated with KMV who received their dose of live measles vaccine with four months of their last dose of vaccine should be revaccinated. Anyone vaccinated before 1968 in whom it is not known if the vaccine was KMV or not should be revaccinated.
What should I do if I am not sure if I have been properly vaccinated or my vaccine records have been lost?,"'If you are unsure of your vaccine status against measles (especially if you are going to work in health care), you should have a blood test to measure your titer of antibodies against measles.' "
What is herd immunity? Why should people care if others choose not to be vaccinated?,"'Herd immunity is an increased effectiveness of a vaccine because significant proportion of a population is immunized. Some people do not actually develop immunity even though they have received the vaccine, and others, because of legitimate medical conditions (like ''cancer''), cannot receive the vaccine. Those people are put at extreme risk of infection and even death by those who simply choose not to be vaccinated. It is reasonable for everyone to expect others to be vaccinated. Due to the anti-vaccination movement, vaccination rates have fallen in the United States. By 2017, only 91% of children 19-35 months had received the MMR. This is below the rate (93%-95%) estimated by the CDC to be needed to maintain herd immunity and prevent outbreaks.' "
Can the measles virus be used to cure cancer?,"'In 2014, there were case reports of patients with ''multiple myeloma'' (a type of blood ""''cancer''"") being treated with a genetically engineered (altered) measles virus that attacks ''tumor'' cells. This is called virotherapy. This type of therapy has been used since the 1950s, but now there is renewed hope that this new use of the measles virus will bring hope to many patients with multiple ''myeloma''.' "

What is a ruptured eardrum?,"'A ruptured eardrum, also known as a perforated tympanic membrane, is a hole or a tear in the eardrum. The eardrum is a thin tissue that separates the ear canal from the middle ear.''This illustration shows where the eardrum is located along with its adjacent structures (external ear or auricle, ear canal, small bones [malleus, incus, and stapes]), and the Eustachian tube. Moreover, it shows how the ''ear bones'' connect the eardrum to other structures such as the semicircular canals, the ''vestibular'' nerve, and the cochlea. Note the close relationship of the middle ear to the temporal bone.''In the picture above, the eardrum is connected to, and moves the bones in the middle ear that send out signals to the nerves and to other structures. A hole in the eardrum does not allow the normal movement of the eardrum as a response to sounds. Usually, the larger the hole in eardrum means that your hearing will worsen. If the rupture is very large, your eardrum may not translate any sound waves to the bones in the middle ear, which results in ''hearing loss''.' "
Does a ruptured eardrum cause pain?,"'Perforations or ruptures of the eardrum may or may not cause ''pain'' depending upon the underlying cause of the rupture or hole. Moreover, the size of the hole, and where it is located on the eardrum surface may play a role in eardrum pain or its absence. Infections are the primary cause of a ruptured eardrum. Usually, if there is no infection, the condition causes no pain.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a ruptured eardrum?,"'Signs and symptoms of a ruptured eardrum may include:''Complications of a ruptured eardrum include ''vestibular disorders'' (''labyrinthitis'', bacterial ''labyrinthitis'', ''vestibular'' neuritis, Meniere’s disease) and ''mastoiditis''.'   Whistling sounds when sneezing or blowing your nose Decreased hearing Hearing loss Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) Spinning sensation (positional vertigo) Nausea Vomiting Inflammation of the middle ear (otitis media) With infection, pain With infection, purulent (pus – like) drainage from your ear canal With infection, blood-tinged drainage from your ear canal With cholesteatoma, chronic ear canal drainage that may contain blood With cholesteatoma, hearing loss and possibly pain, vertigo, tinnitus, pain and headaches"
What causes a ruptured eardrum?,"'There are many different potential causes of an eardrum rupture. Relatively common causes of the condition include:'   Infection is the most common cause of ruptured eardrum. The infection is caused by viruses, bacteria and/or fungi that infect the inner ear and/or Eustachian tube, which exerts pressure on the eardrum and stretches it. The eardrum then may perforate, depending upon the amount of pressure put on it. Trauma, for example, a fall and hit to the side of the head on the ground, during water skiing, or an object like a stick or twig that penetrates the eardrum Rapid changes in atmospheric pressure, for example, barotrauma from scuba diving or from explosives producing a blast wave. Other blast waves, for example, gunshots, fireworks or any type of explosives Car accidents Sticking sharp objects into the ear canal (or even dull objects like cotton-tipped swabs) to remove earwax Sports injuries (any head trauma) Poor technique of irrigation of the ear canal to remove earwax (cerumen) Surgical placement of tubes in the ear (myringotomy)"
How can I tell if I have a ruptured eardrum (diagnosis)?,"'Most ruptured eardrums are diagnosed by routine otoscopy by primary care physicians, ''emergency medicine'' physicians, and/or otolaryngologists, or by medical professionals skilled in laryngology with an otoscope. Small ruptures or a small hole may require otomicroscopy to locate them. Screening tests (screening tympanometry) may show evidence of perforation; however, screening tests need to be confirmed by physical examination of the ear. Most doctors will perform audiometry to record the extent of the hearing loss. This test is highly recommended before treatment attempts.' "
What are the treatments for a ruptured eardrum?,"'The treatments for a perforated eardrum depend upon the symptoms, the size of the rupture, and a risk-benefit analysis done by your doctor and yourself to determine what treatment(s) are best for your condition.''Some patients’ perforation of their eardrum have few or no symptoms, and medical treatment is not necessary for these individuals. However, if the individual participates in certain lifestyle activities such as water sports or scuba diving, they should discuss potential treatments and/or risk-benefits of treatments with their doctor.''Larger perforations may result in greater hearing loss. Audiology tests can help determine the extent of hearing loss. Larger perforations may be repaired surgically, but again, individuals should receive medical advice from their doctor or other healthcare professional about the risk benefits of surgical repair of the eardrum versus the use of a hearing aid.''Over-the-counter'' (OTC) pain medicine (analgesics) are used for ear pain or ''earache'' due to perforation. ''Meclizine'' (''Antivert'') can be used for the ''dizziness'' or for associated ''vertigo''. Occasionally, antibiotics for bacterial infection may be used. Eardrops may help relieve ear discomfort.' "
How long does it take for a ruptured eardrum to heal?,"'On the average, a ruptured eardrum can heal within about two months. Small ruptures may heal faster. Some very large perforations and occasionally, some smaller ones will not heal. For these problems, an eye, ear, nose and throat doctor (ENT surgeon, otolaryngologist) may use a graft of the patient’s fat, muscle or other material like a paper patch to close the perforation and allow the eardrum to heal (myringoplasty, tympanoplasty).' "
Will I lose my hearing if I rupture an eardrum?,"'Although a perforated or ruptured eardrum can cause hearing problems, it does not mean that you will lose your hearing. However, until the eardrum heals, you may experience some decline in your ability to hear. With severe ruptures, some individuals may lose their ability to hear and may not be a candidate for eardrum surgery. These individuals may be able to augment hearing with a hearing aid.' "
Can I go swimming after a ruptured eardrum?,"'Most doctors and health care providers who treat individuals with ruptured eardrums advise their patients not to go ''swimming'' while the eardrum is healing. The eardrum helps to keep ''viruses'', bacteria, and other contaminants from entering the inner ear. Swimming can cause pressure changes that can force contaminants and bacteria through the ruptured membrane and encourage problems such as infection of the inner ear. This situation is especially true for individuals that like to scuba dive. You and your doctor need to discuss when and if you are able to go back to swimming and other activities like scuba diving.' "
How can a ruptured eardrum be prevented?," One of the first ways to prevent a ruptured eardrum is to get treatment for middle ear infections as soon as they develop. If you are flying, you should try to keep your ears clear by equalizing pressure using such techniques as yawning, chewing gum or gently attempting to blow your nose while pinching your nostrils and keeping your mouth closed. Keep small items that children may use to put in their ears out of their reach. Moreover, if the child is old enough, you can teach them about the damage that can be done by putting items in their ears. Adults should never attempt to dig out excessive earwax with cotton swabs, paperclips, hairpins and/or other objects that can easily rupture an eardrum. Noise at high levels (industrial machinery, gun shooting) and sharp changes in atmospheric pressure (explosions) should be avoided by using protective earplugs or earmuffs."
What are Recreational Water Illnesses (RWIs)?,"'Recreational water illnesses (RWIs) are caused by germs spread by swallowing, breathing in mists or aerosols of, or having contact with contaminated water in swimming pools, hot tubs, water parks, water play areas, interactive fountains, lakes, rivers, or oceans. RWIs can also be caused by chemicals in the water or chemicals that evaporate from the water and cause indoor air quality problems. RWIs can be a wide variety of infections, including gastrointestinal, skin, ear, respiratory, eye, neurologic and wound infections. The most commonly reported RWI is ''diarrhea''. Diarrheal illnesses can be caused by germs such as Crypto (short for ''Cryptosporidium''), ''Giardia'', ''Shigella'', norovirus and ''E. coli'' O157:H7.' "
Where are Recreational Water Illnesses (RWIs) Found?,"'RWIs are caused by germs spread through contaminated water in swimming pools, water parks, water play areas, hot tubs, decorative water fountains, oceans, lakes, and rivers.''The most common RWI is ''diarrhea''. Swallowing water that has been contaminated with feces containing germs can cause diarrheal illness.''Swimmers share the water -- and the germs in it -- with every person who enters the pool. On average, people have about 0.14 grams of feces on their bottoms which, when rinsed off, can contaminate recreational water. In addition, when someone is ill with diarrhea, their ''stool'' can contain millions of germs. This means that just one person with diarrhea can easily contaminate the water in a large pool or water park. People may not realize that although there is no standing water in interactive fountains/water play areas, the spray water will rinse any contaminants (for example, diarrhea, vomit, and dirt) down into the water holding area and be sprayed again. In other words, the water is recycled through the system.''Swallowing even a small amount of recreational water that has been contaminated with feces containing germs can make you sick.''To ensure that most germs are killed, check chlorine or other disinfectant levels and pH regularly as part of good pool operation.''Skin infections like ""hot tub ''rash''"" are a common RWI spread through hot tubs and spas. Respiratory illnesses are also associated with the use of improperly maintained hot tubs.'""The high water temperatures in most hot tubs make it hard to maintain the disinfectant levels needed to kill germs. That's why it's important to check disinfectant levels in hot tubs even more regularly than in swimming pools.""'The germs that cause ""hot tub ''rash''"" can also be spread in pools that do not have proper disinfectant levels and in natural bodies of water such as oceans, lakes, or rivers.''Not all decorative fountains are chlorinated or filtered. Therefore, when people, especially ''diaper''-aged children, play in the water, they can contaminate the water with fecal matter. Swallowing this contaminated water can then cause diarrheal illness.'""Oceans, lakes, and rivers can be contaminated with germs from sewage spills, animal waste, water runoff following rainfall, fecal incidents, and germs rinsed off the bottoms of swimmers. It is important to avoid swallowing the water because natural recreational water is not disinfected. Avoid swimming after rainfalls or in areas identified as unsafe by health departments. Contact your state or local health department for water testing results in your area or go to EPA's beach site.""  "
How are Recreational Water Illnesses (RWIs) Spread?,"'Swallowing water that has been contaminated with feces containing germs can cause diarrheal illness.''Swimmers share the water -- and the germs in it -- with every person who enters the pool.

This means that just one person with diarrhea can easily contaminate the water in a large pool or water park. Swallowing even a small amount of recreational water that has been contaminated with feces containing germs can make you sick. Remember, chlorine does not kill germs instantly, and some germs, such as ''Cryptosporidium'' (or ""Crypto""), are extremely chlorine tolerant.''In addition, lakes, rivers, and the ocean can be contaminated with germs from sewage spills, animal waste, and water runoff following rainfall. Some common germs can also live for long periods of time in salt water.''Many other RWIs (skin, ear, eye, respiratory, neurologic, wound, and other infections) are caused by germs that live naturally in the environment (for example, in water and soil). If disinfectant levels in pools or hot tubs are not maintained at the appropriate levels, these germs can multiply and cause illness when swimmers breathe in mists or aerosols of or have contact with the contaminated water.' "
Why Doesn't Chlorine Kill Recreational Water Illness (RWI) Germs?,"'Chlorine (in swimming pools and hot tubs) kills the germs that cause recreational water illnesses (RWIs), but the time it takes to kill each germ varies.''In pools and hot tubs with the correct pH and disinfectant levels, chlorine will kill most germs that cause RWIs in less than an hour. However, chlorine takes longer to kill some germs, such as Crypto (short for ''Cryptosporidium''). Crypto can survive for days even in a properly disinfected pool. This is why it is so important for swimmers to keep germs out of the water in the first place.''To protect yourself, your family, and other swimmers from RWIs, it is essential to learn and practice healthy swimming behaviors.'  "
Who is Most Likely to Get Ill from a Recreational Water Illness (RWI)?,"'Children, ''pregnant'' women, and people with weakened immune systems (for example, people living with ''AIDS'', individuals who have received an organ transplant, or people receiving certain types of ''chemotherapy'') can suffer from more severe illness if infected. People with weakened immune systems should be aware that recreational water might be contaminated with human or animal feces containing Crypto (short for ''Cryptosporidium''). Crypto can cause a life-threatening infection in persons with weakened immune systems.''People with a weakened immune system should consult their health care provider before participating in activities that place them at risk for illness.' "
How Can We Prevent Recreational Water Illnesses (RWIs)?,"'Here are a few easy and effective healthy swimming steps all swimmers can take each time we swim to help protect ourselves, our families, and our friends from recreational water illnesses (RWIs):'  Stay out of the water if you have diarrhea. Shower before you get in the water. Don't pee or poop in the water. Don't swallow the water. Take kids on bathroom breaks. Check diapers, and change them in a bathroom or diaper-changing area-not poolside-to keep germs away from the pool. Reapply sunscreen. Drink plenty of fluids. Pools: Proper free chlorine level (1-3 mg/L or parts per million [ppm]) and pH (7.2-7.8) maximize germ-killing power. Hot tubs/spas: Proper disinfectant level (chlorine [2-4 parts per million or ppm] or bromine [4-6 ppm] and pH [7.2-7.8]) maximize germ-killing power. Most superstores, hardware stores, and pool-supply stores sell pool test strips."
