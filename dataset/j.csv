Questions,Answer
What are the signs and symptoms of jaundice in adults?,"'As already mentioned, jaundice is not a disease, but rather a visible sign of an underlying disease process. Individuals with jaundice will have a yellow discoloration of the skin to varying degrees, and may also exhibit yellowing of the mucous membranes and of the white of the eyes. However, depending on the underlying cause of jaundice, individuals may experience different symptoms. Some individuals may have very few, if any, symptoms at all, while others may experience more severe and pronounced symptoms. Individuals with jaundice may experience any of the following signs and symptoms.'   Pale-colored stools Dark-colored urine Skin itching Nausea and vomiting Rectal bleeding Diarrhea Fever and chills Weakness Weight loss Loss of appetite Confusion Abdominal pain Headache Swelling of the legs Swelling and distension of the abdomen due to the accumulation of fluid (ascites)"
How common is jaundice in adutls? Who gets it?,"'The risk factors for developing jaundice vary based upon the underlying cause.' Certain people with hereditary conditions (for example, thalassemia or hereditary spherocytosis) are at an increased risk of developing jaundice from hemolysis. People who consume alcohol heavily are at an increased risk of developing alcoholic hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cirrhosis leading to jaundice. People who are at an increased risk of exposure to the different types of viral hepatitis (for example, hepatitis B and hepatitis C) are at risk of developing jaundice at the time of infection or subsequently, if liver disease occurs or if liver cancer develops later. Other risk factors include:Eating raw shellfishDrug injections of other substancesTattooingBirth between 1945 and 1965Being an unvaccinated (for hepatitis)Healthcare professionalsParticipating in high-risk sexual activity Eating raw shellfish Drug injections of other substances Tattooing Birth between 1945 and 1965 Being an unvaccinated (for hepatitis) Healthcare professionals Participating in high-risk sexual activity"
What causes jaundice in adults?,"'Jaundice in adults is caused by various medical conditions that affect the normal metabolism or excretion of bilirubin. Bilirubin is mostly formed from the daily breakdown and destruction of ''red blood cells'' in the bloodstream, which release ''hemoglobin'' as they rupture. The heme portion of this hemoglobin molecule is then converted into bilirubin, which is transported in the bloodstream to the ''liver'' for further metabolism and excretion. In the liver, the bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid (made more water-soluble), and is excreted into the gallbladder (where it is stored) and then eventually passed into the ''intestines''. In the intestines, a portion of the bilirubin is excreted in the feces, while some are metabolized by the intestinal bacteria to urobilinogen and excreted in the urine.''Jaundice occurs if there is a dysfunction of the normal metabolism and/or excretion of bilirubin. This disruption in the metabolism or excretion of bilirubin can occur at various stages, and it is, therefore, useful to classify the different causes of jaundice based on where the dysfunction occurs. The causes of jaundice are generally classified as pre-hepatic (the problem arises before secretion to the liver), hepatic (the problem arises within the liver), and post-hepatic (the problem arises after bilirubin is excreted from the liver).'""Jaundice caused during the pre-hepatic phase is due to the excessive destruction (hemolysis) of red blood cells from various conditions. This rapid increase in bilirubin levels in the bloodstream overwhelms the liver's capability to properly metabolize the bilirubin, and consequently the levels of unconjugated bilirubin increase. Conditions which can lead to an increase in the hemolysis of red blood cells include:""   Malaria, Sickle cell disease, Hereditary spherocytosis, Thalassemia, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), Drugs or other toxins, and Autoimmune disorders."
What causes jaundice during the hepatic phase in adults?,"'Jaundice caused during the hepatic phase can arise from abnormalities in the metabolism and/or excretion of bilirubin. This can lead to an increase in both unconjugated and/or conjugated bilirubin levels. Conditions with a hepatic cause of jaundice include:' Acute or chronic hepatitis (commonly viral [Hepatitis A, B, C, D, E] or alcohol related) Cirrhosis (caused by various conditions incuding alcohol toxicity) Drugs or other toxins Crigler-Najjar syndrome Autoimmune disorders Gilbert's syndrome Liver cancer"
What are post-hepatic causes of jaundice in adults?,"'Jaundice from a post-hepatic cause arises from a disruption (an obstruction) in the normal drainage and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the form of bile from the liver into the intestine. This leads to increased levels of conjugated bilirubin in the bloodstream. Conditions that can cause post-hepatic jaundice include' Gallstones, Cancer (pancreatic cancer, gallbladder cancer and bile duct cancer), Strictures of the bile ducts, Cholangitis, Pancreatitis, and Parasites (for example, liver flukes)."
What tests and procedures diagnose jaundice in adults?,"'The presence of jaundice requires a comprehensive medical evaluation to determine the cause. Initially, your health-care professional will take a detailed history of your illness and perform a physical exam, which can sometimes determine the cause of the jaundice. Initial blood testing will also be undertaken, with special attention being given to your:''Blood testing for exposure to hepatitis may also be ordered. Additional blood testing may be ordered based on the initial results. A ''urinalysis'' will likely also be ordered.''Depending on the results of initial blood tests, further studies may be needed to help diagnose the underlying disease process. In certain cases, imaging studies will need to be obtained in order to evaluate for any abnormalities of the liver, gallbladder and pancreas. These imaging studies may include:''Occasionally, people will need further invasive testing to determine the cause of the jaundice. Procedures that may be ordered include endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (''ERCP'') or a ''liver biopsy''.' Liver blood tests Complete blood count (CBC) Electrolyte pane Lipase levels  Abdominal ultrasound Computerized tomography (CT) scan Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan)"
What is the treatment for jaundice in adults?,"'The treatment for jaundice depends entirely on the underlying cause. Once a diagnosis has been established, the appropriate course of treatment can then be initiated. Certain patients will require hospitalization, whereas others may be managed as outpatients at home.'   In certain individuals with jaundice, the treatment will consist of supportive care and can be managed at home. For example, most cases of mild viral hepatitis can be managed at home with watchful waiting and close monitoring by your doctor (expectant management). Novel medications for hepatitis C now can offer a cure for this condition. Alcohol cessation is necessary in patients with cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, or acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol use. Jaundice caused by drugs/medications/toxins requires discontinuation of the offending agent. In cases of intentional or unintentional acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose, the antidote N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) may be required. Various medications may be used to treat the conditions leading to jaundice, such as steroids in the treatment of some autoimmune disorders. Certain patients with cirrhosis, for example, may require treatment with diuretics and lactulose. Antibiotics may be required for infectious causes of jaundice, or for the complications associated with certain conditions leading to jaundice (for example, cholangitis). Blood transfusions may be required in individuals with anemia from hemolysis or as a result of bleeding. Individuals with cancer leading to jaundice will require consultation with an oncologist, and the treatment will vary depending on the type and extent (staging) of the cancer. Surgery and various invasive procedures may be required for certain patients with jaundice. For example, certain patients with gallstones may require surgery. Other individuals with liver failure/cirrhosis may require a liver transplant."
What are the complications of jaundice in adults?,"'The type of complication and the severity of complications vary with the underlying cause leading to jaundice. Certain individuals will not suffer any long-term after effects and will have a full recovery, while for others the appearance of jaundice will be the first indication of a life-threatening condition. A few of the potential complications include:'   Electrolyte abnormalities Anemia Bleeding Infection/sepsis Chronic hepatitis Cancer Liver failure Kidney failure Hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction) Death"
What is the prognosis for an adult with jaundice? Can it be cured? Is it fatal?,"""The prognosis for individuals with jaundice depends on the underlying cause of the condition. There are certain conditions that carry an excellent prognosis with individuals making a full recovery. However, more serious causes of jaundice can sometimes be fatal despite medical or surgical intervention. The development and severity of complications will also determine an individual's prognosis, as will a patient's underlying health and comorbidities (presence of other diseases). Therefore, a case-by-case assessment by your health care professional is necessary in order to determine a more accurate prognosis."" "
Can jaundice in adults be prevented?,"'Certain conditions leading to jaundice can be prevented, whereas others may be less preventable. However, there are certain measures that can be taken in order to decrease the risk of developing jaundice.' Take medications as instructed in order to prevent potential liver damage or unintentional overdose. Individuals with certain medical conditions (for example, G6PD deficiency or cirrhosis) should avoid certain medications altogether. Discuss medications with your health care professional. Avoid high-risk behaviors such as unprotected intercourse or intravenous drug use, and implement universal precautions when working with blood products and needles. This can decrease your risk of developing hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Consider being vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. There is currently no available vaccine against hepatitis C. Avoid potentially contaminated food products or unsanitary water, as this may decrease your risk of developing hepatitis A. When travelling to areas where malaria is endemic, take the recommended precautions and prophylactic medications in order to prevent the development of malaria. Consume alcohol responsibly and only in moderation. This can prevent alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis and pancreatitis, among other conditions. Certain individuals will need to avoid alcohol altogether. Avoid smoking, as it is a risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer, as well as many other malignancies."
What is a Facial Implant?,"'Facial implants are used to enhance certain features of your face, including your cheeks or your jaw line. The surgery may be elective, or needed as the result of prior surgery on the face. Through a facial implant, a ''plastic surgeon'' can aesthetically improve facial contours.' "
Am I A Candidate For a Face Implant?,"' You are a candidate for this procedure if you are in good physical and ''mental health''. You should not expect perfection. Facial implants will not make you look like someone else. However, they will enhance your current features.' "
How Do I Know If a Face Implant is Right For Me?,"' When you sit down with your surgeon for your pre-operative consultation, he or she will ask detailed questions about your medical history. Among the things the surgeon will need to know is if you have had either cosmetic or reconstructive facial surgery before.'' Additionally, he or she will want to know what you seek to change about your appearance and why you are unhappy with your features. Are there other surgeries you want or need to have done, such as a ''facelift'' ,  forehead lift , or other cosmetic procedure?'' If you have dental problems, you will need to let your surgeon know about these.' "
How Are Facial Implants Done?,""" During your pre-operative consultation, you and your surgeon will decide together whether you'll have local anesthesia with an oral sedative to help you relax or general anesthesia (which means you'll be put to ""'sleep'').'"" In most cases, facial implant surgery is completed on an outpatient basis in a hospital, your surgeon's office or a surgical center. Your surgeon will make this determination based on your particular case.""' The length of surgery will depend on which part of your face is affected, but it commonly lasts between one to two hours.' "
Where Are Face Implants Placed?,"'' Lower jaw implant. The 
  implant is placed inside of the lower lip. Incision site will be secured with 
  sutures that will dissolve in about one week. The procedure takes one to two 
  hours. 
   Cheek implant. The implant 
  is placed internally through upper lip or externally via your lower eyelid. 
  Sutures will vary depending on whether they're internal or external. The 
  procedure take about an hour. 
   Chin implant. The implant is placed internally to the lower lip, or under your chin. As with the cheek implant, sutures will vary depending on whether they're internal or external. The procedure takes 30 minutes to an hour"
How Do I Prepare For a Face Implant?,"""The good news about facial implants is that the recovery is quick. You should need only to take one week off from work, at most. Of course, your recovery will depend on your own personal habits and whether or not you're having other surgery performed."""" You should plan to have someone drive you home from the hospital. If you live alone, you should also plan to have someone stay with you at least the first night once you're home. ""' Make sure to wear a loose blouse or shirt that does not have to be pulled over your face. Your surgeon will instruct you on which foods and medications to avoid before and after facial implant surgery. If you are a smoker, your surgeon may ask you to ''quit smoking'' for a certain period before and after the surgery.' "
What Will I Need When I'm Home?,"' Make sure you establish a home recovery area, which should include:' Plenty of ice 
   Freezer bags
 Ointments or creams as recommended by the surgeon for 
  any external incision sites 
   Clean gauze 
   Soft foods, such as protein shakes, pudding, Jell-O, 
  ice cream 
   Telephone within reaching distance of your primary 
  recovery area 
   Mouthwash (note that tooth brushing may be restricted based on your surgeon's recommendations)"
Are There Complications  With Face Implants?,"'As with any surgery, you do risk certain side effects and complications. You will experience ''bruising'' and swelling,   which can last at least two days. Your surgeon will let you know what to watch for, as far as excessive or abnormal   swelling or ''bruising''.''Because you are having an implant inserted into your body, there is a risk of the facial implant shifting. If this happens, you may have to undergo a follow-up operation. Your surgeon will discuss these possibilities with you. You also run the risk of infection; your surgeon will give you antibiotics in this case.' "
"After Having an Implant, Contact Your Doctor Immediately if:"," You develop a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or more 
   You experience abnormal pain or swelling 
   You experience abnormal discharge (such as pus) from the incision site"
Does Insurance Cover Facial Implants?,"' If you are having implants inserted as part of reconstruction surgery, your insurance carrier may offer coverage. Your surgeon can write a letter detailing your case and provide photos that will be taken in your pre-operative consultation.'"" It's important to be well ""'versed'"" on your carrier's policy so you're not surprised if they don't cover something."""" If you are having the surgery performed on a cosmetic basis only, your insurance carrier likely will not provide coverage.   It's very important that you realize future coverage may be affected and your premiums may increase after facial implant surgery.""' Make sure you ask your insurance carrier exactly how your coverage will be affected.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic, Department of Dermatology''Edited by Charlotte E. Grayson, MD, Sept. 2003. ''''Portions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic 2000-2003'''' ' "
What is jet lag?,"'Jet lag, also called desynchronosis and flight ''fatigue'', is a temporary disorder that causes ''fatigue'', ''insomnia'', and other symptoms as a result of air travel across multiple time zones. It is considered a ''circadian rhythm'' ''sleep'' disorder, which is a disruption of the internal circadian\xa0clock.' "
What are other symptoms and signs of jet lag?,"'Besides travel\xa0''fatigue'' and ''insomnia'', a jet lag sufferer may experience a number of physical and emotional symptoms, including ''anxiety'', ''constipation'', ''diarrhea'', ''confusion'', ''dehydration'', ''headache'', irritability, ''nausea'', ''indigestion'', ''difficulty concentrating'', ''sweating'', coordination problems, ''dizziness'', daytime sleepiness, malaise (a general feeling of being unwell), and even ''memory loss''. Some individuals report additional symptoms, such as heartbeat irregularities and increased susceptibility to illness.''Children and ''babies'' can also suffer the same jet lag symptoms as adults.''Generally, people do not need a medical evaluation for a diagnosis of jet lag. If you have traveled across several time zones and feel the symptoms associated with jet lag, you likely have it. If your symptoms of jet lag are severe, do not go away after a few days, or you have any other concerns, see a doctor.'  "
How long does it take to recover from jet lag?,"'Recovering from jet lag depends on the number of time zones crossed while traveling. In general, the body will adjust to the new time zone at the rate of one or two time zones per day. For example, if you crossed six time zones, the body will typically adjust to this time change in three to five days.''Jet lag is temporary, so the prognosis is excellent and most people will recover within a few days.''Complications of jet lag are extremely rare. If a person has a preexisting ''heart'' condition, the ''stress'' of the disruption in the circadian rhythm, combined with the ''stress'' of travel, the high altitude, and immobility during flight may result in a ''heart attack''. If the jet lag results in chronic ''sleep'' deprivation, ''stroke'' may occur in certain predisposed individuals.' "
What is a time zone?,"'The definition of a time zone is a geographical region which has the same time everywhere within it. The world has 24 time zones, one for each hour in the day. Each zone runs from north to south in strips that are approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) wide. (The actual width of each zone varies to accommodate political and geographical boundaries.) As the earth rotates, dawn occurs at a set hour in one time zone, then an hour later in the time zone immediately to the west and so on through the 24-hour cycle. Thus, in the U.S., when it is 6 a.m. in the Eastern Time zone, it is 5 a.m. in the central zone, 4 a.m. in the mountain zone, and 3 a.m. in the Pacific zone.' "
"What 
causes jet lag?","'The cause of jet lag is the inability of the body of a ''traveler'' to immediately adjust to the time in a different zone. Thus, when a New Yorker arrives in Paris at midnight Paris time, his or her body continues to operate on New York time. As the body struggles to cope with the new schedule, temporary ''insomnia'', fatigue, irritability, and an impaired ability to concentrate may set in. The changed bathroom schedule may cause ''constipation'' or ''diarrhea'', and the brain may become confused and disoriented as it attempts to juggle schedules.' "
How does the body keep time?,"'Our bodies have a sort of internal biological clock that follows a 24-hour cycle, called a circadian rhythm. A tiny part of the brain called the hypothalamus acts like an alarm clock to activate various body functions such as hunger, ''thirst'', and sleep. It also regulates body temperature, ''blood pressure'', and the level of hormones and glucose in the bloodstream. To help the body tell the time of day, fibers in the ''optic nerve'' of the eye transmit perceptions of light and darkness to a timekeeping center within the hypothalamus. So, when the eye of an air ''traveler'' perceives dawn or dusk many hours earlier or later than usual, the hypothalamus may trigger activities that the rest of the body is not ready for, and jet lag occurs.' "
Does the direction of travel matter?,"'Yes. ''Travelers'' flying north or south in the same time zone typically experience the fewest problems because the time of day always remains the same as in the place where the flight originated. These ''travelers'' may experience discomfort, but this usually results from confinement in an airplane for a long time or from differences in climate, culture, and ''diet'' at the new location. Time differences do not play a role.''Travelers flying east, on the other hand, typically experience the most problems because they ""lose"" time. For example, on an international flight from Washington, D.C., to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, a traveler loses eight hours. Meals, sleep, bowel habits, and other daily routines are all pushed ahead eight hours.''Travelers flying west ""gain"" time and usually have an easier time adjusting than eastward travelers. However, they too experience symptoms of jet lag after landing because they still must adjust to a different schedule.'  "
Do the symptoms of jet lag vary in intensity?,"'Yes. People flying across only one or two time zones may be able to adjust without noticeable effects of the time change. Those flying across three or more time zones will likely develop noticeable symptoms of jet lag. Generally, the intensity of symptoms varies in relation to the number of time zones crossed and the direction of travel. People also vary in their susceptibility to jet lag symptoms and the severity of the symptoms.' "
What are risk factors for jet lag?,"'The main cause of jet lag is travel across different time zones. However, there are certain risk factors that may result in symptoms being more severe or longer-lasting.' Travel across three or more time zones: Most people can adjust rapidly to a one or two time zone change. Three or more may cause more noticeable symptoms of jet lag. Flying east: As stated previously, travel from west to east causes travelers to ""lose"" time, and this can be a more difficult adjustment. Age: Older adults may recover from jet lag more slowly. Frequent travel: Pilots, flight attendants, and frequent business travelers who are constantly in different time zones may have difficulty adjusting. Preexisting conditions: Preexisting sleep deprivation, stress, and poor sleep habits prior to travel can exacerbate jet lag symptoms. Flight conditions: The monotony of travel, immobility and cramped seating, airline food, altitude, and cabin pressure can impact jet lag symptoms. Alcohol use: Overconsumption of alcohol during long flights can also worsen the symptoms of jet lag."
Are there any remedies for jet lag? Is it possible to prevent jet lag?,"'There are several home remedies that can help with ''prevention'' of jet lag and easier recovery from the symptoms. The following are 12 tips to help travelers to avoid or to minimize the effects of jet lag.''If you are in good physical condition, stay that way. In other words, long before you embark, continue to ''exercise'', eat right, and get plenty of rest. Your physical stamina and conditioning will enable you to cope better after you land. If you are not physically fit, or have a poor ''diet'', begin shaping up and eating right several weeks before your trip.''If you have a medical condition that requires monitoring (such as ''diabetes'' or ''heart disease'""), consult your physician well in advance of your departure to plan a coping strategy that includes medication schedules and doctor's appointments, if necessary, in the destination time zone.""'If your stay in the destination time zone will last more than a few days, begin adjusting your body to the new time zone before you leave. For example, if you are traveling from the U.S. to Europe for a one-month vacation, set your daily routine back an hour or more three to four weeks before departure. Then, set it back another hour the following week and the week after that. Easing into the new schedule gradually in familiar surroundings will save your body the ''shock'' of adjusting all at once.'""If you are traveling east, try going to sleep earlier and getting up and out into the early morning sun. If traveling west, try to get at least an hour's worth of sunlight as soon as possible after reaching your destination.""'There are online jet lag calculators that can help you figure out how much and when to reset your sleep schedule to help you adjust to a time change before you depart.''Do not drink alcoholic ''beverages'' the day before your flight, during your flight, or the day after your flight. These beverages can cause ''dehydration'', disrupt sleeping schedules, and trigger ''nausea'' and general discomfort.''Likewise, do not drink ''caffeinated'' beverages before, during, or just after the flight. ''Caffeine'"" can also cause dehydration and disrupt sleeping schedules. What's more, ""'caffeine'' can rattle your nerves and intensify any travel ''anxiety'' you may already be feeling.''Drink plenty of water, especially during the flight, to counteract the effects of the dry atmosphere inside the plane. Take your own extra water aboard the airplane if allowed.''While seated during your flight, ''exercise'' your legs from time to time. Move them up and down and back and forth. Bend your knees. Stand up and sit down. Every hour or two, get up and walk around. Do not take sleeping pills, and do not nap for more than an hour at a time.''These measures have a twofold purpose. First, they reduce your risk of developing a ''blood clot'' in the legs. Research shows that long periods of sitting can slow blood movement in and to the legs, thereby increasing the risk of a clot. The seat is partly to blame. It presses against the veins in the leg, restricting blood flow. Inactivity also plays a role. It slows the movement of blood through veins. If a clot forms, it sometimes breaks loose and travels to the ''lungs'' (known as ''pulmonary embolism''), lodges in an artery, and inhibits blood flow. The victim may experience ''pain'' and ''breathing'' problems and ''cough'' up blood. If the clot is large, the victim could die. Second, remaining active, even in a small way, revitalizes and refreshes your body, wards off ''stiffness'', and promotes mental alertness which can ease the symptoms of jet lag.''On long flights traveling across eight, 10, or even 12 time zones, break up your trip, if feasible, with a stay in a city about halfway to your destination. For example, if you are traveling from New York to Bombay, India, schedule a stopover of a few days in Dublin or Paris. (At noon in New York, it is 5 p.m. in Dublin, 6 p.m. in Paris, and 10:30 p.m. in Bombay.)''On a long trip, how you feel is more important than how you look. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. Avoid items that pinch, restrict, or chafe. When selecting your trip outfit, keep in mind the climate in your destination time zone. Dress for your destination.''Upon arrival, if you are staying at a hotel, check to see that beds and bathroom facilities are satisfactory and that cooling and heating systems are in good working order. If the room is unsuitable, ask for another.''The sooner you adapt to the local schedule, the quicker your body will adjust. Therefore, if you arrive at noon local time (but 6 a.m. your time), eat lunch, not breakfast. During the day, expose your body to sunlight by taking walks or sitting in outdoor cafés. The sunlight will cue your hypothalamus to reduce the production of sleep-inducing ''melatonin'' during the day, thereby initiating the process of resetting your internal clock.''When traveling with children and babies, try to get them on the local schedule as well. When traveling east (you will lose time), try to keep the child awake until the local bedtime. If traveling west when you will gain time, wake your child up at the local time.'""Try to establish sleeping patterns without resorting to pills. However, if you have difficulty sleeping on the first two or three nights, it's OK to take a mild sedative if your physician has prescribed one. But wean yourself off the sedative as soon as possible. Otherwise, it could become habit-forming.""'Valerian'' root is an herb that can be used as treatment for insomnia. Do not take valerian with alcohol. It is important to consult your physician before taking these or any other herbal remedy.''Sleep medications are not recommended for children.'  "
What is the treatment for jet lag?,"'The best way to treat jet lag is to take measures to prevent it. But you may still feel jet lagged when traveling across many time zones, even with some preventive measures. Treatment to cure jet lag involves some of the home remedies discussed.'""When you arrive at your destination, try to adapt to the local schedule as soon as possible. For example, if you arrive at 6 p.m. local time (but noon your time), eat dinner, not lunch. If your normal bedtime at home is 11 p.m., go to bed at 11 p.m. local time (even if it's only 5 p.m. at home). Get as much exposure to sunshine during the day as possible to help reset your internal ""'body clock''.''Once you arrive at your destination, a small dose of caffeine, such as from your morning coffee, may help jolt you awake for a few hours. Caffeine is best reserved for the early part of the day because it can keep you awake at night if taken too late.'  "
Are there effective medications for jet lag? What is the role of melatonin in jet lag?,"'There are no specific medications for jet lag, only medications that may help you get to sleep more easily when you reach your destination, or that remedy some symptoms of jet lag.''Melatonin is a hormone that plays a key role in body rhythms and jet lag. After the sun sets, the eyes perceive darkness and alert the hypothalamus to begin releasing melatonin, which promotes sleep. Conversely, when the eyes perceive sunlight, they tell the hypothalamus to withhold melatonin production. However, the hypothalamus cannot readjust its schedule instantly; it takes several days.''A dose of melatonin that is between 0.3 mg-5 mg may be taken on the first day you travel at the time you go to sleep at your destination, and for a few days, if needed. Melatonin seems to be most effective when crossing five or more time zones, or traveling east. Melatonin should only be taken by adults. Do not drink alcohol when taking melatonin. Consult a doctor if you plan on taking melatonin.''Prescription or ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) sleeping pills may help you reset your body clock to the time at your destination. Try not to use them if possible, but if your doctor has prescribed sleep medication, it may be taken if needed for up to two or three nights. Try not to take it for longer, as these medications can be habit-forming.''OTC ''sleep aids'' include''Prescription sleep medications include the following:'   diphenhydramine (Sominex, Nytol) and doxylamine (Unisom). Short-acting sedative-hypnotics (non-benzodiazepines): zolpidem (Ambien, ZolpiMist), zaleplon (Sonata), and eszopiclone (Lunesta) Melatonin receptor agonists: ramelteon (Rozerem) Benzodiazepines (tranquilizers): flurazepam (Dalmane), temazepam (Restoril), and estazolam (ProSom)"
What is jock itch? What does jock itch look like?,"'Jock itch is a common, ''itchy'' rash of the groin. It can produce a very intense itch and is associated with a red or pink rash involving the groin folds and genitals. Jock itch is primarily a skin condition in men because of anatomic structures unique to males, the male genitalia.''The symptoms and signs of jock itch may come and go, and many cases of jock itch resolve spontaneously without any treatment. Jock itch is primarily seen in the groin, although it may spread to the inner thighs, genitals (including penis, scrotum, labia, and vaginal opening), and anus. Jock itch causes a red or pink rash on the sides of the groin folds. There may be a dry, scaly, well-demarcated skin rash or a collection of small, pinpoint red or pink ''bumps'' at each ''hair follicle''. This form of eruption is often called ''ringworm'' because of its well-defined red edge with central clearing. The medical term for ''ringworm'' of the groin is ''tinea cruris'', and it is caused by a fungal infection.''While jock itch is frequently noted in otherwise healthy people, those with ''diabetes'' and/or ''obesity'' are more susceptible. Possible causes include irritation from tight-fitting or abrasive underwear, excess moisture, ''sweating'', skin rubbing or friction, ''allergic'' problems, fungal infection, ''Candida'' (yeast) infection, and bacterial overgrowth.''Treatment of fungal-related jock itch may include one or a combination of antifungal creams and, rarely, antifungal medications. Treatment of jock itch that is not caused by fungus involves proper groin hygiene, keeping the genital area clean and dry, and washing frequently with gentle soap and water (especially after ''sweating'' or ''exercise'').'  "
What causes jock itch?,"'Causes of jock itch include the following:''Generally, ''diet'' does not seem to affect jock itch.'   Warmth, skin friction, and moist areas in the groin Tight, occlusive clothing and undergarments that trap in sweat Infections caused by fungus and yeasts: Candida (yeast), Trichophyton, and Epidermophyton (fungal molds) Infections by certain types of bacteria"
What are risk factors for jock itch?,"'Jock itch is most common in adult and middle-aged men. Anyone can get jock itch, which is thought to affect nearly all people at some point in their lives.''Certain groups of people may be more prone to jock itch. Patients with ''diabetes'', obesity, and those with a compromised immune system such as from ''HIV/AIDS'', ''hepatitis'', chronic illnesses, ''cancer'', systemic ''chemotherapy'', immunosuppressive ''drugs'' such as ''prednisone'', and those on biologic immune-system-modifying drugs such as ''infliximab'' (''Remicade'') or ''etanercept'' (''Enbrel'') may be more prone to jock itch.''Other risk factors include' male genitalia, heat, moisture, humidity, obesity, excess sweating, exercise, weakened immune system, tight, occlusive fabrics and undergarments, and athlete's foot infection or other fungal infections on the body."
What are jock itch symptoms and signs?,"'Jock itch usually begins with mild intermittent ''itching'' in the groin. The itching can get worse and become unbearable in some cases. The rash is usually on both sides of the groin and affects the folds.''The rash may become dry, rough, and bumpy, develop pus ''blisters'', or begin to ooze. Sometimes, there is central clearing as the redness of the rash spreads outward to the thighs. The itching and rash can spread to the genitals, including the labia, vagina, scrotum, penis, and anus.''Women may also develop vaginal white discharge and yeast infections. Men may develop infections on the head of the penis, especially if they are not circumcised.''Severe cases may be very uncomfortable and develop secondary complications such as breaks in the skin, open sores, ulcers, and rarely ''cellulitis''.'  "
Does jock itch affect the entire body?,"'Jock itch does not affect the entire body. It is usually limited to the groin, inner thigh folds, genitals, and anal area. Itching (pruritus) of the entire body is not typical of jock itch.' "
Which health care professionals diagnose and treat jock itch?,"'Most primary care physicians can accurately diagnose and treat jock itch. A few other medical conditions may appear just like jock itch and should be examined more closely by a dermatologist.''Other medical conditions can mimic jock itch. Some possible mimics include''Jock itch may be associated with '""athlete's foot""', also called ''tinea pedis''. The same fungus that causes '""athlete's foot""' in a person may actually spread to the groin in some cases. It is important to always check the ''feet'' for ''rashes'' in people with jock itch. Spread of the fungus usually occurs when fungal particles pass onto the crotch while putting on underwear. Any foot infection must be treated in order to avoid recurrence of the jock itch.' ringworm, also called tinea, contact dermatitis, intertrigo, erythrasma, impetigo, diaper rash, irritant or contact dermatitis, heat rash, familial pemphigus, and inverse psoriasis."
How do health care professionals diagnose jock itch?,"""The diagnosis of jock itch is usually based on the symptoms and skin appearance. A microscopic examination of skin scrapings covered in a drop of potassium hydroxide will confirm a fungal cause of jock itch. Occasionally, a fungal culture of the skin scrapings may be necessary. Certain bacteria can produce an eruption in the groin indistinguishable from a fungal infection. An examination with a special ultraviolet light, a Wood's light, will enable identification.""'Occasionally, a small ''skin biopsy'' may be used to help the doctor confirm the diagnosis. Rarely, a skin biopsy (surgically taking a small piece of skin using local numbing medicine) that is examined under a microscope may be necessary in atypical or widespread cases. Sometimes skin biopsies help to exclude other possible diagnoses. A skin swab or culture may be taken and sent to the lab to detect an infectious cause of the jock itch. A bacterial culture may be useful to detect bacteria, such as ''Staphylococcus''.' "
Is jock itch curable? Is jock itch contagious?,"'Most cases of jock itch are easily and fully curable. There are very uncommon, long-standing cases of jock itch that may not be cured. Often these more resistant cases may be controlled with proper treatment and medication. Jock itch sometimes clears completely by itself without treatment.''Although most cases of jock itch are not ''contagious'', cases caused by an infection may be transmitted through skin or sexual contact, sharing of swimwear, or towels. It is possible to transmit fungal jock itch to someone else through close skin contact.''Some people are simply more prone to developing jock itch because of their overall health, activity, anatomy, possible altered immune status, exposure history, and other predisposing ''skin conditions'' like ''eczema''. People with '""athlete's foot""' (''tinea pedis'') are more prone to developing jock itch.' "
What is the treatment for jock itch?,"'There are many treatment options and ''skin care'' ''recipes'' for treating jock itch. Since the two primary causes of jock itch are excess moisture and fungal infections, treatment depends on the exact cause of the jock itch. Treatment of jock itch associated with skin irritation and excess moisture should address general measures to keep the groin clean and dry along with the use of zinc oxide ointment. Treatment of fungal jock itch should include antifungal creams used continuously for two to four weeks. ''Clotrimazole'' cream is an effective treatment for both dermatophyte molds and ''Candida'' (yeast) and can be purchased without a prescription.''It is important to keep in mind that no therapy is uniformly effective in all people.'  "
What home remedy can I use for jock itch?,"'Home remedy for mild jock itch includes the following:' Wash the groin skin two to three times a day. Keep the groin area dry. Avoid excess groin skin irritation by wearing 100% cotton underwear. Avoid fabric softeners, bleaches, or harsh laundry detergents. Apply a mix of over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream and clotrimazole (Lotrimin, Mycelex) cream one to two times a day to the affected area and covering this liberally with zinc oxide ointment."
What holistic jock itch treatments are available?,'Holistic (nonmedicated) home remedy options for jock itch include' soaking the affected area daily with a washcloth dipped in dilute white vinegar (1 part vinegar to 4 parts of water) and drying the skin; and soaking in a bathtub daily or every other day with very dilute Clorox bleach (1 quarter cup of Clorox bleach in a bathtub full of water) and drying the skin.
How do I treat fungal jock itch?,"'Mild fungal or yeast jock itch may be treated by''Moderate fungal or yeast jock itch is often treated by a combination of''Severe fungal or yeast jock itch is typically treated by a combination of' washing the groin twice daily with an antifungal shampoo like ketoconazole (Nizoral shampoo) or selenium sulfide (Selsun Blue shampoo). washing the groin twice daily with an antifungal shampoo like ketoconazole or selenium sulfide; and using a topical antifungal cream like miconazole (Monistat, Micatin), clotrimazole (Lotrimin, Mycelex), or terbinafine (Lamisil). washing groin twice daily with an antifungal shampoo like ketoconazole or selenium sulfide; using a topical antifungal cream like miconazole, clotrimazole, or terbinafine; and taking an antifungal pill like fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole (Sporanox), or terbinafine."
How do I treat bacterial jock itch?,"'Mild bacterial jock itch may be treated with''Moderate bacterial jock itch may be treated with''Severe bacterial jock itch may be treated with' antibacterial skin washes like Lever 2000 soap and a neomycin-containing ointment. antibacterial skin washes like chlorhexidine soap twice daily; and twice-daily application of a topical antibiotic like erythromycin lotion or metronidazole (Flagyl) lotion. antibacterial skin washes like chlorhexidine soap twice daily and a 5- to 14-day course of an oral antibiotic like cephalexin (Keflex), dicloxacillin, doxycycline, minocycline (Dynacin, Minocin), or erythromycin."
How is itching from jock itch treated?,"'Assuming the condition is not caused by an infectious agent, itching from jock itch can be treated with a short course of one of the following:' Use a short five- to seven-day course of a mild to medium potency, topical steroid cream like prescription triamcinolone 0.025% once or twice a day for inflamed or itchy areas. Use a short five- to seven-day course of a mild over-the-counter topical steroid cream like 1% hydrocortisone (Cortaid) one to three times a day for itching."
What is the best drug for jock itch?,"'Overall, the best jock-itch drug is a topical antifungal cream like miconazole, clotrimazole, or terbinafine, assuming the condition is produced by a fungus. If the jock itch does not improve within two to three weeks of treatment, then a physician should be consulted. The use of the topical antifungal should be suspended for two weeks prior to seeing the physician.' "
Why is my groin still discolored?,"'Residual skin discoloration in the groin may persist for weeks to months after more severe forms of jock itch clear. Because it is in an area that is not generally visible, it does not usually require treatment. Eventually, the skin discoloration will return to a more natural color.' "
What are possible complications of jock itch?,"'Complications are infrequent since jock itch is usually a self-limited skin condition. Rarely, the rash may spread past the groin onto the thighs and genitals. Secondary skin infections from scratching or rubbing can uncommonly deepen, causing cellulitis or ''abscess'' formation.''Another potential complication includes temporary skin discoloration called post-inflammatory hypopigmentation (lighter than the regular skin color) or ''hyperpigmentation'' (darker then the regular skin color). This altered skin color may occur after the rash has improved or after a temporary flare. Permanent scarring is uncommon.' "
When should someone call a doctor about jock itch?,"'If jock itch persists over one to two weeks despite proper skin care and use of over-the-counter medications, it may be necessary to schedule an appointment to see a physician. In addition, if the rash is worsening despite medical treatment or if any of the following signs of an advancing ''skin infection'' develop, contact a physician.' Spreading despite treatment Increasing pain Rapidly spreading rash Formation of pus, abscesses, or draining sores Red streak(s) extending from the groin (called lymphangitis) Fever or chills Failing to improve after two weeks of continuous topical treatment"
What is the prognosis with jock itch?,"'The prognosis with jock itch is very good. Overall, jock itch tends to be an easily treated and curable skin condition. Commonly, it is a mild, benign, usually noncontagious, and self-limited skin condition. More widespread, atypical cases of jock itch may be embarrassing, chronically disfiguring, and psychologically distressing.' "
Is it possible to prevent jock itch?,"'Jock itch ''prevention'' efforts include good general skin hygiene and keeping the groin clean and dry. The following steps will help prevent the itchy condition:' Wash groin and buttocks with soap and water after exercise and sweating. Wash workout clothes, underwear, and swimwear after each use. Minimize groin moisture by using white cotton underwear. Change underwear frequently and especially after sweating. It may be useful to apply petroleum jelly or zinc oxide ointment (Desitin) liberally to the groin creases prior to physical exercise to minimize friction skin damage. Wash clothes, undergarments, and towels in hot soapy water. Use loose-fitting cotton underwear and clothing. Avoid undergarments with polyesters, nylon, or synthetic fibers. Use an antifungal powder like Lamisil or Zeasorb to keep the groin dry. Avoid perfumed creams, powders, sprays, or lotions on the groin. Do not go barefoot, especially at gyms, schools, and public pools. Treat athlete's foot if you have it. Cover your feet with socks before you put on your underwear and pants."
What is jock itch (tinea cruris)?,"'Jock itch'', also termed ''tinea cruris'', tinea (the fungal name is often used as the disease name), or ''ringworm'', is a term that describes superficial fungal infection of the skin located in the groin area (genitals, inner thighs, and buttock area). It is a common ''skin infection'' that occurs in warm, moist areas of the body. The major cause of jock itch is the fungus termed tinea; the term jock itch came from the ''itchy'' superficial ''fungal infections'' that frequently occur in males who wear protective gear like cups to protect the genitals during sports activities (football, baseball, and other sports). However, any tight clothing (''swimming'' suits, tight-fitting shorts, and tight-fitting underwear) may increase the chance of acquiring jock itch.' "
Is jock itch contagious?,"'Jock itch is considered to be mildly ''contagious''. Usually, it requires direct person-to-person contact or wearing the clothing of someone who has the skin disease. It is mildly contagious because if the individual who becomes associated with a person with jock itch does not provide a similar warm, moist environment that supports the growth of fungi, the uninfected individual may not get the disease.' "
How will I know if I have jock itch?,"'Symptoms of jock itch include the following:''If you are not sure you have jock itch, a physician can, after physical exam and patient history, either examine the flaking skin scales or send them off to be examined. Microscopic detection of the fungi can confirm a diagnosis of jock itch.'  An itchy red rash that is slightly raised and flaking Crack formations in the skin Often, the skin rash will have a sharp line that defines the extent of the ongoing infection. Some individuals may have a burning pain in the rash area. When clothing rubs against the skin, additional discomfort and/or pain can occur."
How does jock itch spread?,"'In general, jock itch is spread usually in areas where there are individuals dressing and undressing in athletic facilities like locker rooms. These areas frequently have a hot, moist environment that is ideal for fungal growth and also ideal for cross-contamination of clothing that is tight-fitting (jock straps, swimming suits, underwear, for example) so that fungi are more easily spread to other people.' "
How do I know when I am cured of jock itch?,"'When the skin returns to normal (redness, ''itching'', burning and flaking cease), a person is cured of jock itch. However, no matter if the person spontaneously clears the infection or if the individual requires an antifungal medication to clear the symptoms, it is still possible to become reinfected. In fact, it is not unusual for individuals to have recurrent infections especially if they fail to keep the groin area free of tight-fitting clothes and moisture.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about jock itch?,"'The majority of patients who develop jock itch do not need to contact a medical ''caregiver''. Jock itch can spontaneously be cured in some individuals simply by making sure that tight-fitting clothing and moisture from ''sweating'' or other sources is not allowed to remain in contact with the skin for any extended time (minutes to hours). For others, simple ''over-the-counter'' topical antifungal creams such as ''clotrimazole'' or ''terbinafine'' will be effective.''However, if over-the-counter antifungals are not effective, if the skin area develops a secondary (usually bacterial) infection, if the area becomes tender and/or swollen, ''lymph node'' swelling and tenderness develop, or if red streaks develop, a medical caregiver should be contacted. Individuals who are ''obese'"" with skin folds (overlapping skin) and those with suppressed immune function are likely to require more intensive treatment; such treatments are usually prescribed by the patient's physician."" "
What is a joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"""A joint aspiration is a procedure whereby a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain synovial fluid from a patient's joint. Joint aspiration is typically performed by a doctor or ancillary health care provider as an office procedure or at the bedside of hospitalized patients. Joint aspiration is sometimes called joint drainage and is medically referred to as arthrocentesis."" "
"How do patients prepare for a joint aspiration (arthrocentesis), and does it cause pain?","""Patients do not need any special preparation before a joint aspiration. The aspiration is easily performed in a doctor's office as an outpatient procedure. ""'Pain'"" is minimized by topical or local anesthetics applied onto the patient's skin or just beneath the skin. Usually, there is a momentary, slight amount of ""'pain'"" as the needle is inserted into the patient's joint space. Withdrawal of the fluid into the syringe does not typically cause pain. Injection of medication into the joint does not typically cause pain. There is very slight pain sometimes as the needle is withdrawn from the joint. Any pain is reduced by topical or local anesthetics that block pain sensation."" "
"What is the purpose of joint aspiration (arthrocentesis), and when is it performed?","'Joint aspiration can be both used for diagnosis and medical treatment of ''arthritis'"" of a joint. Joint aspiration is used to obtain fluid from the patient's joint for examination in the laboratory. Analysis of joint fluid can help the physician to define causes of ""'joint swelling'' (joint effusion) or arthritis, such as infection, ''gout'' arthritis, and ''rheumatoid disease''. Fluid from the joint can be tested for white cell count, crystals, protein, glucose, as well as cultured to detect infection. Each of these laboratory parameters can be helpful in defining the cause of a particular form of arthritis, particularly in distinguishing inflammatory from non-inflammatory forms of arthritis. The result can be key to identifying various potential ''rheumatology'' diseases and musculoskeletal conditions.''Joint aspiration can also be a helpful treatment in relieving joint swelling and pain. Removal of synovial fluid from the joint that is inflamed can also remove the white blood cells within that are sources of enzymes that can be destructive to the joint. This treatment can more rapidly restore the health of the joint. Bursa aspiration procedure and indications for ''bursitis'' are analogous to joint aspiration for arthritis, except the bursa is the target instead of the joint (intra-articular). The result and analysis of the fluid (aspirate) is similarly evaluated for various diseases and conditions in the laboratory.' "
What is a joint injection?,"'A ''joint injection'' is a procedure whereby a medicine is injected into the joint space with a needle and syringe. Occasionally, cortisone (an anti-inflammatory medication) or ''hyaluronic acid'' derivatives (a synthetic joint lubricant, approved for pain relief of the knee in ''degenerative arthritis'') are injected into the joint during the joint aspiration. ''Cortisone injection'' can rapidly relieve ''joint inflammation'' and further reduce symptoms. Simultaneous joint aspiration followed by joint injection can often be done by changing the aspiration syringe with the syringe for the injection (such as for steroid injection). In this way, the joint injection does not need to be done as a separate procedure. ' "
How is joint aspiration (arthrocentesis) performed?,"'The skin over the joint is cleaned by the health care professional using a liquid, typically an ''iodine'' solution (Betadine). Local anesthetic is used in the area of the joint; either by injection, a topical liquid coolant, or both. A needle with a syringe attached is inserted within the joint (joint injection) and joint fluid is drawn back under suction (aspirated) into the syringe. For certain diseases and medical conditions, the health care professional will also inject medicine into the joint after fluid removal. The needle is then removed and a Band-Aid or dressing is applied over the entry point.' "
Who performs a joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'Joint aspirations can be performed under medical guidelines by qualified doctors, including general physicians, internists, orthopedic surgeons, ''rheumatologists'', interventional radiologists, emergency room physicians, as well as nurse practitioners and physician assistants.' "
Who should not undergo joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'There are few health contraindications to a joint aspiration. People who are taking blood-thinning medicines (''anticoagulants'' such as ''warfarin'' [''Coumadin'']) for underlying health reasons can have bleeding into the joint. The risk of this is extremely low, unless the level of blood thinner is too high (making the blood very thin), in which case the procedure may need to be temporarily delayed. The risk of bleeding into the joint is minimized when the physician uses the thinnest needle possible and applies ''cold'' packs after the procedure. If the skin over a joint is infected, the joint should not be aspirated, in order to prevent the infection from spreading into the joint.' "
What are complications of joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'Medical complications of joint aspiration are uncommon. Possible complications of the aspiration procedure include a reaction to the local anesthetic, local ''bruising'' or, minor bleeding into the joint. If cortisone is used, there may be loss of pigment in the skin (a light-colored spot may develop). A rare but serious complication of the procedure is infection of the joint (''septic arthritis'').''With ''corticosteroid'' injections, additional uncommon complications include inflammation in the joint as a result of the medication crystallizing, shrinkage (atrophy) or loss of pigment of skin at the injection site, increased blood ''sugar'' (worsening of ''diabetes mellitus''), and aggravation of preexisting infection elsewhere in the body. If multiple injections with ''corticosteroids'' are given too frequently, it is possible to develop systemic side effects (side effects throughout the body), such as ''weight gain'', puffy face and trunk, and ''easy bruising''. Injection of hyaluronic acid derivatives may cause local inflammation and swelling of the joint due to a reaction to the medication. Hyaluronic acid injections into the ''knee joint'' for pain relief are generally given no more frequently than every six months.'  "
What is the recovery time for joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'There is no recovery time required after joint aspiration. Doctors typically will suggest avoiding stressful activity with the joint for at least 24 hours, especially if medication (such as steroid injection) has been injected by joint injection. If pain increases after the procedure while at home, the doctor should be notified. ' "
What is arthritis?,"'Arthritis is a joint disorder featuring inflammation. A joint is an area of the body where two different bones meet. A joint functions to move the body parts connected by its bones. Arthritis literally means inflammation of one or more joints.''Arthritis is frequently accompanied by ''joint pain''. Joint ''pain'' is referred to as arthralgia. When four or more joints are involved, the arthritis is referred to as polyarthritis. When two or three joints are involved, it is referred to as oligoarthritis. When only a single joint is involved, it is referred to as monoarthritis.' "
How many types of arthritis exist?,"'There are many types of arthritis (over 100 identified). The types of arthritis range from those related to wear and tear of cartilage (such as ''osteoarthritis'') to those associated with inflammation resulting from a misdirected immune system (such as ''rheumatoid arthritis''). While osteoarthritis and ''rheumatoid arthritis'' are common types of arthritis, there are many other common and uncommon types of arthritis. Other types of inflammatory arthritis include''Together, the many types of arthritis make up the most common chronic illness in the United States. Self-limited forms of arthritis can occur in association with virus infections.' psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and reactive arthritis. Types of infectious arthritis include septic arthritis and Lyme arthritis."
What are arthritis symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of arthritis include pain and limited function of joints. Joint inflammation from arthritis is characterized by ''joint stiffness'', swelling, redness, pain, and warmth.''Many of the forms of arthritis, because they are rheumatic diseases, can cause symptoms affecting various organs of the body that do not directly involve the joints. Therefore, symptoms in some patients with certain forms of arthritis can also include'   Stiffness of the joint can lead to poor function. Tenderness of the inflamed joint can be present with or without pain. When large joints are involved, such as the knee, there can be loss of cartilage with limitation of motion from the joint damage. When arthritis affects the small joints in fingers, there can be bone growth and loss of hand grip and grip strength of the hand associated with stiffness. Arthritis of weight-bearing joints can lead to difficulty walking from poor joint function and arthritis pain. fever, gland swelling (swollen lymph nodes), weight loss, fatigue, feeling unwell, and even symptoms from abnormalities of organs such as the lungs, heart, or kidneys."
"What is a rheumatologist, and what specialties of doctors treat arthritis?","'A rheumatologist is a medical doctor who specializes in the nonsurgical treatment of rheumatic illnesses, especially arthritis.''Rheumatologists'' have special interests in unexplained ''rash'', ''fever'', arthritis, ''anemia'', ''weakness'', ''weight loss'', ''fatigue'', joint or ''muscle pain'', autoimmune disease, and ''anorexia''. They often serve as consultants, acting like medical detectives at the request of other doctors.''Rheumatologists have particular skills in the evaluation of the over 100 forms of arthritis and have special interests in inflammatory arthritis such as''Classical adult ''rheumatology'' training includes four years of medical school, one year of internship in internal medicine, two years of internal-medicine residency, and two years of rheumatology fellowship. There is a subspecialty board for rheumatology certification, offered by the American Board of Internal Medicine, which can provide board certification to approved rheumatologists.''Other doctors who treat arthritis include' rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative arthritis, spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, Still's disease, dermatomyositis, Sjögren's syndrome, vasculitis, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, back pain, gout, pseudogout, relapsing polychondritis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, serum sickness, reactive arthritis, Kawasaki disease, fibromyalgia, erythromelalgia, Raynaud's disease, growing pains, iritis, osteoporosis, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and others. Pediatric rheumatologists are physicians who specialize in providing comprehensive care to children (as well as their families) with rheumatic diseases, especially arthritis. Pediatric rheumatologists are pediatricians who have completed an additional two to three years of specialized training in pediatric rheumatology and are usually board-certified in pediatric rheumatology. pediatricians, internists, general-medicine doctors, family medicine doctors, and orthopedic surgeons."
Whom does arthritis affect?,"'Arthritis sufferers include men and women, children, and adults.' "
What causes arthritis?,"'The causes of arthritis depend on the form of arthritis. Causes include''Arthritis is classified as one of the rheumatic diseases. These are conditions that are different individual illnesses, with differing features, treatments, complications, and prognoses. They are similar in that they have a tendency to affect the joints, muscles, ligaments, cartilage, and tendons, and many have the potential to affect other internal body areas.' injury (leading to osteoarthritis), metabolic abnormalities (such as gout with elevated uric acid blood levels and pseudogout with hypercalcemia), hereditary factors, the direct and indirect effect of infections (bacterial and viral), and a misdirected immune system with autoimmunity (such as in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus)."
What are risk factors for arthritis?,'The major risk factors for most forms of arthritis are genes that are ''inherited'' from ancestors. ''Trauma''-related arthritis is related to the risk of injury from specific activities.' 
How do health care professionals diagnose arthritis?,"'The first step in the diagnosis of arthritis is a meeting between the doctor and the patient. The doctor will review the history of symptoms, examine the joints for inflammation and deformity, as well as ask questions about or examine other parts of the body for inflammation or signs of diseases that can affect other body areas. Furthermore, medical professionals might order certain blood (''C-reactive protein'', ''sedimentation rate'', ''rheumatoid factor'', anti-CCP antibody, etc.), urine, joint fluid, and/or X-ray tests. Plain X-ray testing can be used to easily detect signs of osteoarthritis, such as joint space narrowing and spur formation (''osteophytes''). A doctor will make a diagnosis based on the pattern of symptoms, the distribution of the inflamed joints, and any blood and X-ray findings. Several visits may be necessary before the doctor can be certain of the diagnosis. A doctor with special training in arthritis and related diseases is called a rheumatologist (see below).''Many forms of arthritis are more of an annoyance than serious. However, millions of people suffer daily with pain and disability from arthritis or its complications.''Earlier and accurate diagnosis can help to prevent irreversible damage and disability. Properly guided programs of ''exercise'' and rest, medications, physical therapy, and surgery options can idealize long-term outcomes for those with arthritis. ''Exercise'' and exercise routines can be helpful in providing joint stability by strengthening the musculoskeletal system while improving balance. Physical therapists can provide the care needed for properly guided exercise regimens.'""It should be noted that both before and especially after the diagnosis of arthritis, communication with the treating doctor is essential for optimal health. This is important from the standpoint of the doctor, so that he/she can be aware of the vagaries of the patient's symptoms as well as their tolerance of and acceptance of treatments. It is important from the standpoint of patients, so that they can be assured that they have an understanding of the diagnosis and how the condition does and might affect them. It is also crucial for the safe use of medications."" "
Is there an arthritis diet?,"'For most forms of arthritis, diets play little or no role in precipitating or exacerbating the condition. However, in general, oils of fish have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. Some osteoarthritis suffers benefit from ''omega-3'' fatty acid ''supplements''. Some people with osteoarthritis feel they benefit from the curcumin that is present in curry foods.''Gout'' is a particular type of metabolic arthritis that is clearly ''diet''-related. Foods that are high in purines, especially red meats and shellfish, can worsen the condition. Moreover, certain foods elevate the levels of uric acid, including ''alcohol'' (especially beer) and those foods containing high amounts of fructose (such as the ''corn'' syrup found in soft ''drinks''). For people with ''celiac disease'', ''gluten''-containing foods (wheat, barley, rye) can worsen ''joint pains''.'  "
Are there foods to avoid when you have arthritis?,"'With the exception of the unique metabolic form of arthritis in ''gout'' and ''celiac disease'', there are no universally accepted foods that must be avoided by people with arthritis. That is, most foods are joint friendly. ''Gout'', however, can be promoted and precipitated by ''dehydration'' as well as fructose-containing foods (''corn'' syrup, etc.), high-purine foods (seafood, shellfish, organ meats), and alcoholic ''beverages'' (particularly beer). People with gout should avoid these foods. The arthritis of ''celiac disease'' can be worsened by intake of gluten-containing foods (wheat, barley, rye).' "
What are medications and treatment options for arthritis?,"'The treatment of arthritis is very dependent on the precise type of arthritis present. An accurate diagnosis increases the chances for successful treatment. Treatments available include physical therapy, home remedies, splinting, ''cold''-pack application, paraffin wax dips, anti-inflammatory ''drugs'', pain medications (ranging from pain-relieving ''over-the-counter'' medications such as ''acetaminophen'' [''Tylenol''] and ''ibuprofen'' [''Motrin'', ''Advil''] to narcotics), immune-altering medications, biologic medications, and surgical operations (including joint replacement surgery). Pain from osteoarthritis of the knee can be relieved by ''hyaluronic acid'' injections. Rheumatoid arthritis can require medications that suppress the immune system (disease modifying medications). Low back arthritis that is irritating nerves of the spine can require surgical repair. For more on treatments of particular forms of arthritis, see the corresponding articles for the form of arthritis of interest.'  "
"What are the prognosis (outlook) for arthritis, and what are arthritis complications?","'The outlook for patients with arthritis depends on its severity, complications, and whether or not there are non-joint manifestations of the disease. For example, rheumatoid arthritis can affect the lungs, kidneys, eyes, etc. Chronic joint inflammation can lead to permanent damage to the joint and loss of joint function, making movement difficult or impossible.' "
Is it possible to prevent arthritis?,"""Since most forms of arthritis are inherited to some degree, there is no real way to prevent them. Arthritis that follows joint injury could be prevented by adhering to safety regulations and trying to avoid becoming injured. Arthritis related to infection (for examples, septic arthritis, reactive arthritis, Whipple's disease) could be prevented by not becoming infected with the causative organism. The extent to which this is possible varies depending upon the individual condition."" "
What is the Arthritis Foundation?,"'The Arthritis Foundation is the only national voluntary health organization whose purpose is directed solely to all forms of arthritis. The Arthritis Foundation has national and international programs involving support for scientific research, public information and education for affected patients and their families, training of specialists, public awareness, and local community assistance.''Local branch chapters of the Arthritis Foundation serve to disseminate information about arthritis and rheumatic diseases, as well as function as referral centers. Moreover, many of the various forms of arthritis have their own foundations that serve as information and referral health resources for local communities.''It is the ultimate goal of scientific arthritis research that optimal treatment programs are designed for each of the many form of arthritis. This field will continue to evolve as improvements develop in the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis and related conditions.' "
What are corticosteroids?,"'Corticosteroids are a class of medications that are related to cortisone, a steroid. Medications of this class powerfully reduce inflammation. They are used to reduce the inflammation caused by a variety of diseases. Cortisone is one type of ''corticosteroid''. For the purpose of this review, ""cortisone"" is used interchangeably with ""corticosteroid.""''Corticosteroids can be taken by mouth, inhaled, applied to the skin, given intravenously (into a vein), or injected into the tissues of the body. Examples of corticosteroids include ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone'' (given by mouth), ''methylprednisolone'' sodium succinate injection (''Solu-Medrol'') (given intravenously), as well as triamcinolone (Kenalog), betamethasone (Celestone), methylprednisolone (''Depo-Medrol''), and others (given by injection into body tissues). This article describes the role of cortisone injections into the soft tissues and joints.'  "
What types of doctors administer cortisone injections?,"'Many different health care professionals administer cortisone shots. The specialty administering the cortisone depends on the condition being treated. For example, a primary care doctor or nurse practitioner may administer a systemic cortisone injection in the gluteus muscle to treat an ''allergic reaction''. Orthopedic surgeons commonly give cortisone injections into a joint, such as a cortisone injection into the knee to treat knee ''osteoarthritis''. Dermatologists treat some ''skin conditions'' with special preparations of cortisone (to minimize the risk of changing the appearance of the skin after the injection). ''Rheumatologists'' administer cortisone injections into joints to treat ''joint inflammation'' caused by ''rheumatoid arthritis'' or other forms of ''arthritis''.' "
Is a cortisone injection merely a pain reliever or  temporary remedy?,"'Corticosteroids are not ''pain'' relievers. They reduce inflammation. When corticosteroids relieve pain, it is because they have reduced inflammation that would be causing pain.''While the inflammation for which corticosteroids are given can recur, corticosteroid injections can provide months to years of relief when used properly. These cortisone shots also can cure diseases (permanently resolve them) when the problem is tissue inflammation localized to a small area, such as ''bursitis'' and tendinitis. They can also cure certain forms of ''skin inflammation''.' "
For what conditions are cortisone injections used?,"'Cortisone injections can be used to treat the inflammation of small areas of the body (local injections), or they can be used to treat inflammation that is widespread throughout the body (systemic injections). Examples of conditions for which local cortisone injections are used include inflammation of a bursa (''bursitis of the hip'', knee, elbow, or shoulder), a tendon (tendinitis such as ''tennis elbow''), and a joint (arthritis). Knee ''osteoarthritis'', ''hip bursitis'', painful foot conditions such as ''plantar fasciitis'', ''rotator cuff'' tendinitis, ''frozen shoulder'', and many other conditions may be treated with cortisone injections. Certain skin disorders, such as ''alopecia'' (a specific type of ''hair loss''), can be treated with cortisone injections.''Corticosteroid injections given in the shoulder may cure localized soft-tissue inflammation in the shoulder, such as bursitis or tendinitis. Cortisone injections of the shoulder may be used in conjunction with physical therapy to treat ''rotator cuff'' syndrome and ''impingement syndrome''.''Injections of cortisone and a local anesthetic such as ''lidocaine'' are sometimes used to confirm a diagnosis. For example, if pain in the buttock and groin improves after a cortisone injection in the hip, the pain is caused by hip arthritis rather than arthritis in the low back.''Epidural injections in the lumbar spine (lumbar epidural) are cortisone injections inserted into a specific location in the spinal canal of the low back by a specialist under X-ray guidance (fluoroscopy). These injections may help relieve ''back pain'' and ''sciatica''. Epidural injections can also be given in other areas of the spinal canal to relieve upper back and ''neck pain''.''Systemic corticosteroid injections are used for more widespread conditions affecting many joints or the skin, such as ''allergic'' reactions, ''asthma'', and ''rheumatoid arthritis''. These injections are usually given intramuscularly, into a large muscle group such as the gluteus muscles in the buttocks, or into the deltoid muscle in the shoulder. The corticosteroid is then absorbed into the blood and travels through the bloodstream to treat the inflammation. Systemic corticosteroids can also be administered intravenously to treat more severe widespread inflammation.'  "
What are the advantages of cortisone injections?,"'When a joint is swollen, joint fluid may be removed before cortisone is injected. If fluid is removed, it can be analyzed with laboratory testing to determine what caused the joint to swell. This is a big advantage as it is a powerful and accurate diagnostic test.''A distinct benefit of a steroid injection is that the relief of localized inflammation in a particular body area is more rapid and powerful than with traditional anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' given by mouth, such as ''aspirin''. A single injection also can avoid certain side effects that can accompany many ''over-the-counter'"" oral anti-inflammatory medications, notably irritation of the stomach. Cortisone injections can be administered easily in the doctor's office. Other advantages include the rapid onset of the medication's action, dependability, high success rate, and minimal side effects."" "
What are the disadvantages and side effects of cortisone injections?,"'Disadvantages of cortisone injections are the necessity of piercing the skin with a needle as well as potential short- and long-term side effects. It should be emphasized that though each of these side effects is possible, they usually do not occur.''Short-term cortisone injections complications are uncommon but include''Increased pain after the injection is typically due to a post-injection flare because true ''allergies'' to cortisone are very rare. Tendons can be weakened by steroid injections administered in or near tendons. Tendon ruptures as a result have been reported. Facial flushing may occur in up to 40% of cases but lasts only briefly. ''Sweating'', ''dizziness'', and ''insomnia'' are uncommon side effects. Nerve damage is a very uncommon side effect.''In people who have ''diabetes'"", cortisone injections can elevate a person's blood ""'sugar'"". In patients with underlying infections, cortisone injections can suppress somewhat the body's ability to fight the infection and possibly worsen the infection or may mask the infection by suppressing the symptoms and signs of inflammation. Generally, cortisone injections are used with caution in people with ""'diabetes'' and avoided in people with active infections. Cortisone injections are also used cautiously in people with a ''bleeding disorder''.''Long-term complications of corticosteroid injections depend on the dose and frequency of the injections. With higher doses and frequent administration, which increases total systemic exposure to the corticosteroid, potential side effects include'   shrinkage (atrophy) and lightening of the color (depigmentation) of the skin at the injection site, introduction of bacterial infection into the body (such as a joint infection), local bleeding from broken blood vessels in the skin or muscle, soreness at the injection site, aggravation of inflammation in the area injected because of reactions to the corticosteroid medication (post-injection cortisone flare). thinning of the skin, easy bruising, weight gain, puffiness of the face, acne (steroid acne), elevation of blood pressure, cataract formation, thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), a rare but serious type of damage to the bones of the large joints (avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis)."
Are there special side effects that can occur with cortisone joint injections?,"'Cortisone injections into a joint may have side effects in addition to those described above. Unique side effects of joint injections involve injury to the joint tissues, particularly with repeated injections. These injuries include thinning of the joint cartilage, weakening of the ligaments of the joint, increased inflammation in the joint (arthritis) due to a reaction to a corticosteroid that has crystallized, and introduction of infection into the joint.' "
Are there special advantages in using cortisone injections for joint inflammation (arthritis)?,"'Cortisone injections into a joint can be beneficial in rapidly reducing ''joint pain'' while restoring function to a body part immobilized by inflammation, such as an arthritic knee or elbow. This might be particularly important in certain circumstances, such as the gainful employment of a family breadwinner or someone who lives alone. Despite potential and infrequently reported adverse reactions as described above, it is generally felt that low, intermittent doses of corticosteroids pose little risk of significant side effects.''Cortisone injections into a joint also can decrease the inflammation in diseased joints throughout the body when the corticosteroids are absorbed from the joint into the circulation.' "
How are cortisone injections of soft tissues given?,"'The medical professional administering the injection draws up the corticosteroid into a syringe. A local anesthetic (such as lidocaine) may simultaneously be drawn into the syringe. Next, the area to be injected is selected. Typically, the skin over the area to be injected is sterilized with a liquid solution, either ''alcohol'' or Betadine.''Sometimes, the area is topically anesthetized by rapid cooling using a spray such as ethyl chloride. The needle of the syringe then is inserted into the tissue to be injected and the solution is ejected from the syringe into the area of inflammation. The needle then is withdrawn, and a sterile bandage is applied to the injection site.' "
How are cortisone injections into a joint given?,"'The method of administering a cortisone injection into a joint (intra-articular joint injection) is similar to that of soft-tissue injections. Betadine, however, is more commonly used for sterilization of the skin over the joint. This is an important precaution to prevent introducing infection into the joint. Furthermore, if there is an excessive amount of fluid within the joint, it often is removed first with a separate syringe and needle prior to injection of the cortisone. Removal of this joint fluid allows the doctor to examine the fluid and submit a sample to the laboratory for diagnosis. Removal also rapidly relieves pain by reducing the pressure in the fluid-filled joint. Finally, removal of fluid may allow the joint to heal more quickly. After a health care professional removes the fluid, he or she injects the cortisone medication into the joint, sometimes along with an anesthetic such as lidocaine or ''bupivacaine'' (''Marcaine''). Some health care professionals use an ''ultrasound'' to guide the needle into the exact location desired prior to injecting the cortisone into a joint (injection with ultrasound guidance).' "
How long does it take to recover after a cortisone injection?,'Recovery after a cortisone injection does not take long. Resting the joint after the injection is important to allow the inflammation to decrease. Formal ''exercise'' involving the injected joint should be avoided for several days after the injection.' 
Are cortisone injections painful?,"""In an expert's hands, the opposite is more often the case. That is, minimal pain from the procedure is noted while relief from the pain of the inflammation occurs rapidly. Occasionally, cortisone injections of joints that have degenerated (become damaged) or that are particularly small (such as finger joints) can be associated with temporary minor pain at the time of the injection. This is not generally expected. Less frequently, nerves can be irritated, either directly by the needle during the injection or by the corticosteroid medication. Again, pain after the injection is not common or anticipated."" "
How long does a cortisone injection last?,"'At times the relief from a cortisone injection begins almost immediately after the procedure, but it can take a few days for relief. A cortisone injection administered for certain conditions may be curative (such as for certain types of bursitis or mild ''trigger finger''), but with some conditions the symptoms of the condition recur after weeks or months. In this situation, another cortisone injection can be given, but risks of side effects increase with more frequent or regular injections.' "
How often can someone receive cortisone injections?,"'How often cortisone injections are given varies based on the reason for the injection. This is determined on a case-by-case basis by the health care practitioner. If a single cortisone injection is curative, then further injections are unnecessary. Sometimes, a series of injections might be necessary; for example, cortisone injections for a trigger finger may be given every three weeks, to a maximum of three times in one affected finger. In other instances, such as knee osteoarthritis, a second cortisone injection may be given approximately three months after the first injection, but the injections are not generally continued on a regular basis.' "
How many cortisone injections can someone receive?,"'There is no absolute maximum number of cortisone injections that a person may receive. The risk of side effects increases as the number of injections increases, and so the risks and benefits of each injection are considered carefully prior to administration. It is unusual to give cortisone shots in the same location on a routine basis.' "
Facts you should know about total hip replacement," The prostheses for a total hip replacement (total hip arthroplasty) can be inserted into the pelvis and femur with or without cement. The options are customized for each patient by the orthopedic surgeon. Chronic pain and impairment of daily function of patients with severe hip arthritis are reasons for considering treatment with total hip replacement. Complications and risks of total hip replacement surgery have been identified. Preoperative banking of the blood of patients planning total hip replacement is considered when possible. This blood can be used for transfusion if needed (autologous transfusion). Physical therapy is an essential part of rehabilitation after a total hip replacement. Patients with artificial joints are generally recommended to take antibiotics before, during, and after any elective invasive procedures (including dental work)."
What is a total hip replacement?,"'A total hip replacement is a surgical procedure whereby the diseased cartilage and bone of the hip joint is surgically replaced with artificial materials. The normal hip joint is a ball and socket joint. The socket is a ""cup-shaped"" component of the pelvis called the acetabulum. The ball is the head of the thighbone (femur). Total hip joint replacement involves surgical removal of the diseased ball and socket and replacing them with a metal (or ceramic) ball and stem inserted into the femur bone and an artificial ''plastic'' (or ceramic) cup socket. The metallic artificial ball and stem are referred to as the ""femoral prosthesis"" and the plastic cup socket is the ""acetabular prosthesis."" Upon inserting the prosthesis into the central core of the femur, it is fixed with a bony cement called methylmethacrylate. Alternatively, a ""cementless"" prosthesis is used that has microscopic pores which allow bony ingrowth from the normal femur into the prosthesis stem. This ""cementless"" hip is felt to have a longer duration and is considered especially for younger patients. Total hip replacement is also referred to as total hip arthroplasty.'  "
Who is a candidate for total hip replacement?,"'Total hip replacements are performed most commonly because of progressively worsening of severe ''arthritis'' in the hip joint. The most common type of arthritis leading to total hip replacement is ''degenerative arthritis'' (''osteoarthritis'') of the hip joint. This type of arthritis is generally seen with ''aging'', congenital abnormality of the hip joint, or prior ''trauma'' to the hip joint. Other conditions leading to total hip replacement include bony ''fractures'' of the hip joint, ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and death (''aseptic necrosis'', or ''avascular necrosis'') of the hip bone. Hip bone necrosis can be caused by ''fracture'' of the hip, ''drugs'' (such as chronic use of ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone''), ''alcoholism'', and systemic diseases (such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'').''The progressively intense ''chronic pain'', together with impairment of daily function including ''walking'', climbing stairs, and even arising from a sitting position, eventually become reasons to consider a total hip replacement. Because replaced hip joints can fail with time, whether and when to perform total hip replacement are not easy decisions, especially in younger patients. Replacement is generally considered after ''pain'' becomes so severe that it impedes normal function despite use of anti-inflammatory and/or ''pain'' medications. A total hip joint replacement is usually an elective procedure, which means that it is an option selected among other alternatives and can be scheduled on a routine basis. It is a decision that is made with an understanding of the potential risks and benefits. A thorough understanding of both the procedure and anticipated outcome is an important part of the decision-making process with the orthopedic surgeon.'  "
What are total hip replacement complications?,"'The risks of total hip replacement include ''blood clots'' in the lower extremities that can travel to the ''lungs'' (''pulmonary embolism''). Severe cases of ''pulmonary embolism'' are rare but can cause respiratory failure and death. Other problems include difficulty with urination, local skin or joint infection, ''fracture'' of the bone during and after surgery, scarring, limitation of motion of the hip, dislocation of the hip replacement, and loosening of the prosthesis that eventually leads to prosthesis failure. Because total hip joint replacement requires anesthesia, the usual risks of anesthesia apply and include ''heart'' arrhythmias, ''stroke'', ''liver'' toxicity, and ''pneumonia''.' "
What preparation is needed for the procedure?,"'The preoperative evaluation generally includes a review of all medications being taken by the patient. Anti-inflammatory medications, including ''aspirin'', are often discontinued one week prior to surgery because of the effect of these medications on platelet function and blood clotting. Other preoperative evaluations include complete blood counts, ''electrolytes'' (potassium, sodium, chloride), blood tests for kidney and liver functions, ''urinalysis'', ''chest X-ray'', ''EKG'', and a physical examination. Your physician will determine which of these tests are required, based on your age and medical conditions. Any indications of infection, severe heart or lung disease, or active metabolic disturbances such as uncontrolled ''diabetes'' may postpone or defer total hip joint surgery.''If the condition of the hip allows it, some doctors will recommend a preoperative ''exercise'' program to build muscle and increase flexibility. This can help with recovery.''Total hip joint replacement can involve blood loss. Patients planning to undergo total hip replacement often will donate their own (autologous) blood to be stored for transfusion during the surgery. Should ''blood transfusion'' be required, the patient will have the advantage of having his or her own blood available, thus minimizing the risks related to blood transfusions.' "
What will recovery be like for the patient after surgery?,"'A total hip joint replacement takes approximately two to four hours of surgical time. The preparation prior to surgery may take up additional time. After surgery, the patient is taken to a recovery room for immediate observation that generally lasts between one to four hours. The lower extremities will be closely observed for both adequate sensation and circulation. If unusual symptoms of numbness or tingling are noted by the patient, recovery room nurses are available and should be notified by the patient. Upon stabilization, the patient is transferred to a hospital room.'""During the immediate recovery period, patients are given intravenous fluids. Intravenous fluids are important to maintain a patient's electrolytes and replace any fluids lost during surgery. Using the same IV, antibiotics might be administered as well as pain medication. Patients also will notice tubes draining fluid from the surgical ""'wound'' site. The amount and character of the drainage is important to the doctor and can be monitored closely by the nurse in attendance. A dressing is applied in the operating room and will remain in place for two to four days to be later changed by the attending surgeon and staff.''Pain-control medications are commonly given through a patient-controlled-analgesia (PCA) pump whereby patients can actually administer their own dose of medications on demand. Pain medications occasionally can cause ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Antinausea medications may then be given.''Measures are taken to prevent blood clots in the lower extremities. Patients are placed in elastic hose (TEDs) after surgery. Compression stockings are often added, which help by forcing blood circulation in the legs. Patients are encouraged to actively ''exercise'' the lower extremities in order to mobilize venous blood in the lower extremities to prevent blood clots. Medications are often given to thin the blood in order to further prevent blood clots.''Patients may also experience difficulty with urination. This difficulty can be a side effect of medications given for pain. As a result, catheters are often placed into the bladder to allow normal passage of urine.''Immediately after surgery, patients are encouraged to frequently perform deep ''breathing'' and ''coughing'' in order to avoid lung ''congestion'' and the collapse of tiny airways in the lungs. Patients are also given a ""blow bottle,"" whereby active blowing against resistance maintains the opening of the breathing passages.' "
What is involved in the rehabilitation process after total hip joint replacement?,"'After total hip joint replacement surgery, patients often start physical therapy immediately! On the first day after surgery, it is common to begin some minor physical therapy while sitting in a chair. Eventually, rehabilitation incorporates stepping, walking, and climbing. Initially, supportive devices such as a walker or crutches are used. Pain is monitored while exercise takes place. Some degree of discomfort is normal. It is often very gratifying for the patient to notice, even early on, substantial relief from the preoperative pain for which the total hip replacement was performed.''Physical therapy is extremely important in the overall outcome of any joint replacement surgery. The goals of physical therapy are to prevent contractures, improve patient education, and strengthen muscles around the hip joint through controlled exercises. Contractures that can cause limitation of joint motion result from scarring of the tissues around the joint. Contractures do not permit full range of motion and therefore impede mobility of the replaced joint. Patients are instructed not to strain the hip joint with heavy lifting or other unusual activities at home. Specific techniques of body posturing, sitting, and using an elevated toilet seat can be extremely helpful. Patients are instructed not to cross the operated lower extremity across the midline of the body (not crossing the leg over the other leg) because of the risk of dislocating the replaced joint. They are discouraged from bending at the waist and are instructed to use a pillow between the legs when lying on the non-operated side in order to prevent the operated lower extremity from crossing over the midline. Patients are given home exercise programs to strengthen the muscles around the buttock and thigh. Most patients attend outpatient physical therapy for a period of time while incorporating home exercises regularly into their daily living.''Occupational therapists are also part of the rehabilitation process. These therapists review precautions with the patients related to everyday activities. They also educate the patients about the adaptive equipment that is available and the proper ways to do their ""ADLs"" or activities of daily living.'  "
What other postoperative instructions are given to patients with total hip joint replacements?,"'Patients will continue to use supportive devices as monitored and recommended by the therapist and attending physician. Medications are likely to be given to further prevent blood clots in the legs. These include ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'') or aspirin medications. Occasionally, ''heparin'' (''enoxaparin'' [''Lovenox'']) can be given by self-injection at home. A doctor will determine how long a patient needs to take this medication. Additional medications are given for pain, ''sleep'', and occasionally for muscle relaxation.'""Gradually, patients become more confident and less dependent on supportive devices. Patients are instructed to look for signs of infection, including swelling, warmth, redness, or increased pain in or around the surgical site. The patient should notify the doctor's office immediately if these changes are noted or if there is injury to the hip. The wound site will be inspected regularly by the attending physician. The ""'sutures'', which are usually staples, are removed several weeks after the operation.' "
What is the prognosis of total hip joint replacement?,"'Patient education is important to ensure longevity of the replaced hip. Strenuous exercises such as ''running'' or contact sports are discouraged, since these activities can reinjure the replaced hip. ''Swimming'' is ideal in improving muscle strength and promoting mobility and endurance.''Patients should be aware and notify any caregivers that they have an artificial joint. Antibiotics are recommended during any invasive procedures, whether surgical, urological, gastroenterological, or dental. Infections elsewhere in the body should also be treated to prevent seeding of infection into the joint. This is important because bacteria can pass through the bloodstream from these sites and cause infection of the hip prosthesis.''Measurements of metallic substances that can erode away from the metal portions of hip replacements can indicate toxicity or wear of the prostheses. With high levels of cobalt measured in blood of these patients, it is suggested that an ''MRI'' of the hip be performed to be certain an abnormal growth of tissue (pseudotumor) is not present.''Hip joint replacement surgery is one of the most successful joint surgeries performed today. In well-selected patients, who are appropriate candidates for total hip replacements, the procedure lasts at least 15 years in most patients. Long-term results have been improving impressively with new devices and techniques. The future will provide newer techniques which will further improve patient outcomes, mobility, and lessen the potential for complications.'  "
What is a total knee replacement?,"'A total knee replacement is a surgical procedure whereby the diseased knee joint is replaced with artificial material. The knee is a hinge joint that provides motion at the point where the thigh meets the lower leg. The thighbone (or femur) abuts the large bone of the lower leg (tibia) at the knee joint.''During a total knee replacement, the end of the femur bone is removed and replaced with a metal shell. The end of the lower leg bone (tibia) is also removed and replaced with a channeled ''plastic'' piece with a metal stem. Depending on the condition of the kneecap portion of the knee joint, a plastic ""button"" may also be added under the kneecap surface. The artificial components of a total knee replacement are referred to as the prosthesis.''The posterior cruciate ligament is a tissue that normally stabilizes each side of the knee joint so that the lower leg cannot slide backward in relation to the thighbone. In total knee replacement surgery, this ligament is either retained, sacrificed, or substituted by a polyethylene post. Each of these various designs of total knee replacement has its own particular benefits and risks.'  "
What patients should consider a total knee replacement?,"'Total knee replacement surgery is considered for patients whose knee joints have been damaged by either progressive ''arthritis'', ''trauma'', or other rare destructive diseases of the joint. The most common reason for knee replacement in the United States is severe ''osteoarthritis'' of the knees.''Regardless of the cause of the damage to the joint, the resulting progressively increasing ''pain'' and ''stiffness'' and decreasing daily function lead the patient to consider total knee replacement. Decisions regarding whether or when to undergo knee replacement surgery are not easy. Patients should understand the risks as well as the benefits before making these decisions about knee replacement.'  "
What are the risks of undergoing a total knee replacement?,"'Risks of total knee replacement include ''blood clots'' in the legs that can travel to the ''lungs'' (pulmonaryembolism). ''Pulmonary embolism'' can cause ''shortness of breath'', ''chest pain'', and even ''shock''. Other risks include ''urinary tract infection'', ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' (usually related to pain medication), chronic ''knee pain'' and stiffness, bleeding into the knee joint, nerve damage, blood vessel injury, and infection of the knee which can require reoperation. Furthermore, the risks of anesthesia include potential ''heart'', lung, kidney, and ''liver'' damage.' "
What is involved with the pre-operative evaluation for total knee replacement?,"'Before surgery, the joints adjacent to the diseased knee (hip and ankle) are carefully evaluated. This is important to ensure optimal outcome and recovery from the surgery. Replacing a knee joint that is adjacent to a severely damaged joint may not yield significant improvement in function as the nearby joint may become more painful if it is abnormal. Furthermore, all medications that the patient is taking are reviewed. Blood-thinning medications such as ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'') and anti-inflammatory medications such as ''aspirin'' may have to be adjusted or discontinued prior to knee replacement surgery.''Routine blood tests of liver and kidney function and urine tests are evaluated for signs of ''anemia'', infection, or abnormal metabolism. ''Chest X-ray'' and ''EKG'"" are performed to exclude significant heart and lung disease that may preclude surgery or anesthesia. Finally, a knee replacement surgery is less likely to have good long-term outcome if the patient's weight is greater than 200 pounds. Excess body weight simply puts the replaced knee at an increased risk of loosening and/or dislocation and makes recovery more difficult.""'Another risk is encountered in younger patients who may tend to be more active, thereby adding trauma to the replaced joint.' "
What happens in the post-operative period? What is involved in the recovery from surgery?,"'A total knee replacement generally requires between one and a half to three hours of operative time. Post-surgery, patients are taken to a recovery room, where vital organs are frequently monitored. When stabilized, patients are returned to their hospital room.''Passage of urine can be difficult in the immediate postoperative period, and this condition can be aggravated by pain medications. A catheter inserted into the urethra (a Foley catheter) allows free passage of urine until the patient becomes more mobile.''Physical therapy is an extremely important part of rehabilitation and requires full participation by the patient for optimal outcome. Patients can begin physical therapy 48 hours after surgery. Some degree of pain, discomfort, and stiffness can be expected during the early days of physical therapy. Knee immobilizers are used in order to stabilize the knee while undergoing physical therapy, ''walking'', and sleeping. They may be removed under the guidance of the physical therapist for various portions of physical therapy.''A unique device that can help speed recovery is the continuous passive motion (CPM) machine. The CPM machine is first attached to the operated leg. The machine then constantly moves the knee through various degrees of range of motion for hours while the patient relaxes. This can help to improve circulation and minimize the risk of scarring and contracture of the tissues around the knee.''Patients will start walking using a walker and crutches. Eventually, patients will learn to walk up and down stairs and grades. A number of home exercises are given to strengthen thigh and calf muscles.'  "
How does the patient continue to improve as an outpatient after discharge from the hospital? What are recommended exercises?,"'For an optimal outcome after total knee replacement surgery, it is important for patients to continue in an outpatient physical-therapy program along with home exercises during the healing process. Patients will be asked to continue exercising the muscles around the replaced joint to prevent scarring (and contracture) and maintain muscle strength for the purposes of joint stability. These exercises after surgery can reduce recovery time and lead to optimal strength and stability.''The ''wound'' will be monitored by the surgeon and his/her staff for healing. Patients also should watch for warning signs of infection, including abnormal redness, increasing warmth, swelling, or unusual pain. It is important to report any injury to the joint to the doctor immediately.''Future activities are generally limited to those that do not risk injuring the replaced joint. Sports that involve ''running'' or contact are avoided, in favor of leisure sports, such as golf, and ''swimming''. Swimming is the ideal form of ''exercise'', since the sport improves muscle strength and endurance without exerting any pressure or ''stress'' on the replaced joint.''Patients with joint replacements should alert their doctors and dentists that they have an artificial joint. These joints are at risk for infection by bacteria introduced by any invasive procedures such as surgery, dental or gum procedures, urological and endoscopic procedures, as well as from infections elsewhere in the body.''The treating physician will typically prescribe antibiotics before, during, and immediately after any elective procedures in order to prevent infection of the replaced joint.''Though infrequent, patients with total knee replacements can require a second operation years later. The second operation can be necessary because of loosening, ''fracture'', or other complications of the replaced joint. Reoperations are generally not as successful as original operations and carry higher risks of complications. Future replacement devices and techniques will improve patient outcomes and lead to fewer complications.'  "
What happens in joint replacement surgery?,"'Joint replacement surgery involves replacing a destroyed joint with an artificial joint. In knee or ''hip replacement'' surgery, the artificial joint is made out of metal and ''plastic'"".  In the case of joint replacement in the hand, the new joint is most commonly composed of silicone rubber or the patient's own tissues such as a portion oftendon.""'Joint replacement surgery, also known as arthroplasty, is very common. Each year, orthopedic surgeons perform thousands of joint replacement surgeries in the U.S.  (Most of these procedures are performed on the large weight-bearing joints such as the hips and knees.) Joint replacement surgery in the hand is typically used in treating severe ''arthritis'' that involves the small joints of the hand.''The hips and knees receive continuous ''stress'' from ''walking'',  ''running'', sporting activity, or injury and are more commonly affected by the wearing of cartilage (''degenerative arthritis'') than the  hand joints.  However, the joints of the hand do experience ''stress'' in everyday use, and because the hand joints are smaller, these stresses are concentrated over a smaller surface area. The high ratio of stress to surface area can cause the smooth joint cartilage to wear over the years.  As the cartilage degenerates, the underlying bone becomes exposed.  When the deteriorated joint moves, bone rubs upon bone causing ''pain'', swelling, limiting motion, and frequently causing a grinding or popping sensation.  Furthermore, forms of arthritis that are caused by inflammation of the tissues lining the joint frequently affect the small joints of the hands and wrists to cause joint destruction.  Examples include ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and  ''psoriatic arthritis''.' "
"What are symptoms and signs of arthritis of the hand and 
wrist?","'The most common symptoms of arthritis of the hands include ''pain'', ''stiffness'', and swelling over the joints. The pain is usually worsened when the joint is moved.  Moreover, motion of the joint is frequently limited due to pain and joint contractures.  Symptoms can lead to difficulty with daily living activities including tying shoes, buttoning buttons, opening jars, or turning a key in a lock.''Physical signs of arthritis of the hand include changes in the appearance of the joints.  The joints most commonly affected by degenerative arthritis are those at the ends of the fingers.  Swelling and ''bumps'', or nodes, can occur at the small joints at the area of the base of the nail.  These bumps are called Heberden nodes and can become extremely painful.  The joint at the base of the thumb can also become swollen with ''bone spurs'' and cause pain and deformity.  The joint destruction also leads to severe pain when pinching the fingers together and gripping forcefully.  Joint motion limitation can also decrease the ability to grip.''Wrist arthritis can cause pain with motion of the wrist or grasping and lifting.  Wrist range of motion is frequently limited by the arthritis.  Patients typically experience relief when the wrist is stabilized by a splint.''Rheumatoid arthritis'' frequently causes swelling, pain, and stiffness in the wrists, as well as the small joints in the middle and at the base of the fingers. This disease frequently causes hand deformities.  Tissue lumps called rheumatoid nodules can form over the joints of the hand and wrist.  The joints of the fingers and thumb can become deformed and contracted by the destruction of the supporting ligaments, so that grasping and pinching movements are not possible.' "
How are patients with hand joint abnormalities evaluated?,"'The diagnosis of hand joint problems typically involves evaluating symptoms, physical examination, and the x-ray appearance of the joints.  Blood testing is sometimes also helpful in the assessment process.  Joint replacement surgery becomes a treatment option when significant joint destruction and/or deformity are present.' "
What are the different surgical options?,"'Surgical options include'""The optimal surgical treatment of arthritis of the hand and wrist varies from patient to patient and is based on many factors.  These factors include the patient's age, hand dominance, employment, level of pain, functional goals, and underlying disease."" cleaning of the abnormal cartilage and bone, including removal of bone 
spurs, fusion of the joint, and joint replacement surgery."
When is surgical cleaning of the joint the best alternative?,"'Surgical cleaning of the joint, or salvage procedure, is usually performed in cases of early ""wear and tear"" arthritis where there are painful bone spurs or, in cases of ''rheumatoid arthritis'', where there is a large amount of inflamed tissue.  Removal of bone spurs is especially helpful when the arthritis involves the joints at the ends of the fingers (distal interphalangeal or DIP joints).' "
"What is a joint fusion? When is it the best surgical 
option?","'Fusion of a joint involves removing the joint and surgically ""fusing"" the bone ends so that the two bones effectively become one solid bone.  This procedure terminates all motion at that joint and thus eliminates the pain. The benefit of fusion is pain relief and the downside is elimination of motion at the fused joint, which can hinder function. This surgical option is reserved for patients with advanced arthritis.''Joint fusion is usually the best surgical option in patients who are younger and very active. Younger patients may not be candidates for joint replacement because of the increased stress demand on the joints which accompany higher activity levels.  This increased stress demand can quickly wear out an artificial joint.' "
When is joint replacement surgery the best surgical option?,"'Joint replacement surgery in the hand is an excellent option for treating arthritis of the hand in older, low-activity patients and for those with ''rheumatoid arthritis''. Joint replacement surgery can provide pain relief, increase finger range of motion, and improve hand function.' "
"How do the surgical options vary with the different joints of 
the hands and wrists?","'Hand joint replacement surgery options differ according to the specific joint(s) involved.''1. ''DIP joint (joint closest to the fingertip)'': This joint is not a good candidate for joint replacement.  The bones are very small and do not hold the implant very well. The best treatment option for advanced arthritis at this joint is fusion.  Hand function is only minimally compromised by lack of motion at this joint after a fusion procedure, while pain is relieved.''2. ''PIP joint (second joint from the fingertip)'': Joint replacement is commonly performed in the PIP joint.  Hand function, especially power grasp, can be hindered by fusion of this joint.  The small and ring fingers are the best candidates for joint replacement as they are the most important for power grasp.  The index finger is not a good candidate for a PIP joint replacement, as it must withstand sideways forces which accompany movements such as key turning and fine manipulation of objects.  These forces cause excess stress on the joint implant and can lead to early implant breakage.''There have been numerous false (prosthetic) joints designed for PIP joint replacement, but only one has stood the test of time.  The only nonexperimental PIP joint replacement is the silicone interpositional arthroplasty.  These joints are made of silicone rubber and have a flexible hinge in the middle and stems at the ends which insert into the shaft of the bone, providing stability.  The most frequently used silicone joint implants are termed the Swanson implant and the Sutter implant.''The best results with PIP joint replacement are in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in older, lower-activity patients.''3. ''MCP joint (third joint from the fingertip)'': ''Osteoarthritis'' rarely affects the MCP joints.  The most common need for joint replacement in this joint is destruction from rheumatoid arthritis.  Silicone joint replacement of the MCP joint has been used since the 1960s and has produced excellent long-term results.''4. ''Thumb basal joint (where the thumb meets the wrist)'': This joint is exposed to very high stresses with normal activities.  Forces felt at the tip of the thumb are multiplied 12 times in their effect to the thumb base, thus predisposing this joint to wear.  Arthritis of this joint is very common, especially in women, and frequently requires joint replacement.  Attempts at silicone replacement of this joint have not been as successful as hoped due to implant failure and bone destruction.  Thus, the most common joint replacement procedure for the thumb base is done with natural material.  The procedure is termed the ligament reconstruction-tendon interposition procedure (LRTI).  This procedure uses the patient\'s own tendon to stabilize the thumb and resurface the joint.  LRTI provides stability and pain relief. Long-term results have been excellent.  This has also been called the tendon roll or ""anchovy"" procedure because the tendon used is curled to form the new joint cushion.''5. ''Wrist joint'': Most patients with wrist arthritis are best treated with surgical joint cleaning or fusion and not joint replacement.  Most wrist-joint prostheses on the market are currently investigational and for use in extremely low activity patients with ''osteoarthritis'' or rheumatoid arthritis. ''Summary''''Arthritis of the hand and wrist is a very common and complex problem with many nonsurgical and surgical treatment options.  Deciding which alternative is best can require the skills of the primary doctor, the arthritis specialist (''rheumatologist''), and/or an orthopedic surgeon.' "
Joint Replacement Surgery of the Hand At A Glance," Joint replacement surgery involves replacing a destroyed joint with an artificial joint. This procedure is typically employed in treating severe arthritis involving certain joints. Surgical options for treatment of arthritis of the hand include cleaning of the abnormal cartilage and bone, fusion, and replacement surgery."
What is a joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"""A joint aspiration is a procedure whereby a sterile needle and syringe are used to drain synovial fluid from a patient's joint. Joint aspiration is typically performed by a doctor or ancillary health care provider as an office procedure or at the bedside of hospitalized patients. Joint aspiration is sometimes called joint drainage and is medically referred to as arthrocentesis."" "
"How do patients prepare for a joint aspiration (arthrocentesis), and does it cause pain?","""Patients do not need any special preparation before a joint aspiration. The aspiration is easily performed in a doctor's office as an outpatient procedure. ""'Pain'"" is minimized by topical or local anesthetics applied onto the patient's skin or just beneath the skin. Usually, there is a momentary, slight amount of ""'pain'"" as the needle is inserted into the patient's joint space. Withdrawal of the fluid into the syringe does not typically cause pain. Injection of medication into the joint does not typically cause pain. There is very slight pain sometimes as the needle is withdrawn from the joint. Any pain is reduced by topical or local anesthetics that block pain sensation."" "
"What is the purpose of joint aspiration (arthrocentesis), and when is it performed?","'Joint aspiration can be both used for diagnosis and medical treatment of ''arthritis'"" of a joint. Joint aspiration is used to obtain fluid from the patient's joint for examination in the laboratory. Analysis of joint fluid can help the physician to define causes of ""'joint swelling'' (joint effusion) or arthritis, such as infection, ''gout'' arthritis, and ''rheumatoid disease''. Fluid from the joint can be tested for white cell count, crystals, protein, glucose, as well as cultured to detect infection. Each of these laboratory parameters can be helpful in defining the cause of a particular form of arthritis, particularly in distinguishing inflammatory from non-inflammatory forms of arthritis. The result can be key to identifying various potential ''rheumatology'' diseases and musculoskeletal conditions.''Joint aspiration can also be a helpful treatment in relieving joint swelling and pain. Removal of synovial fluid from the joint that is inflamed can also remove the white blood cells within that are sources of enzymes that can be destructive to the joint. This treatment can more rapidly restore the health of the joint. Bursa aspiration procedure and indications for ''bursitis'' are analogous to joint aspiration for arthritis, except the bursa is the target instead of the joint (intra-articular). The result and analysis of the fluid (aspirate) is similarly evaluated for various diseases and conditions in the laboratory.' "
What is a joint injection?,"'A ''joint injection'' is a procedure whereby a medicine is injected into the joint space with a needle and syringe. Occasionally, cortisone (an anti-inflammatory medication) or ''hyaluronic acid'' derivatives (a synthetic joint lubricant, approved for pain relief of the knee in ''degenerative arthritis'') are injected into the joint during the joint aspiration. ''Cortisone injection'' can rapidly relieve ''joint inflammation'' and further reduce symptoms. Simultaneous joint aspiration followed by joint injection can often be done by changing the aspiration syringe with the syringe for the injection (such as for steroid injection). In this way, the joint injection does not need to be done as a separate procedure. ' "
How is joint aspiration (arthrocentesis) performed?,"'The skin over the joint is cleaned by the health care professional using a liquid, typically an ''iodine'' solution (Betadine). Local anesthetic is used in the area of the joint; either by injection, a topical liquid coolant, or both. A needle with a syringe attached is inserted within the joint (joint injection) and joint fluid is drawn back under suction (aspirated) into the syringe. For certain diseases and medical conditions, the health care professional will also inject medicine into the joint after fluid removal. The needle is then removed and a Band-Aid or dressing is applied over the entry point.' "
Who performs a joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'Joint aspirations can be performed under medical guidelines by qualified doctors, including general physicians, internists, orthopedic surgeons, ''rheumatologists'', interventional radiologists, emergency room physicians, as well as nurse practitioners and physician assistants.' "
Who should not undergo joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'There are few health contraindications to a joint aspiration. People who are taking blood-thinning medicines (''anticoagulants'' such as ''warfarin'' [''Coumadin'']) for underlying health reasons can have bleeding into the joint. The risk of this is extremely low, unless the level of blood thinner is too high (making the blood very thin), in which case the procedure may need to be temporarily delayed. The risk of bleeding into the joint is minimized when the physician uses the thinnest needle possible and applies ''cold'' packs after the procedure. If the skin over a joint is infected, the joint should not be aspirated, in order to prevent the infection from spreading into the joint.' "
What are complications of joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'Medical complications of joint aspiration are uncommon. Possible complications of the aspiration procedure include a reaction to the local anesthetic, local ''bruising'' or, minor bleeding into the joint. If cortisone is used, there may be loss of pigment in the skin (a light-colored spot may develop). A rare but serious complication of the procedure is infection of the joint (''septic arthritis'').''With ''corticosteroid'' injections, additional uncommon complications include inflammation in the joint as a result of the medication crystallizing, shrinkage (atrophy) or loss of pigment of skin at the injection site, increased blood ''sugar'' (worsening of ''diabetes mellitus''), and aggravation of preexisting infection elsewhere in the body. If multiple injections with ''corticosteroids'' are given too frequently, it is possible to develop systemic side effects (side effects throughout the body), such as ''weight gain'', puffy face and trunk, and ''easy bruising''. Injection of hyaluronic acid derivatives may cause local inflammation and swelling of the joint due to a reaction to the medication. Hyaluronic acid injections into the ''knee joint'' for pain relief are generally given no more frequently than every six months.'  "
What is the recovery time for joint aspiration (arthrocentesis)?,"'There is no recovery time required after joint aspiration. Doctors typically will suggest avoiding stressful activity with the joint for at least 24 hours, especially if medication (such as steroid injection) has been injected by joint injection. If pain increases after the procedure while at home, the doctor should be notified. ' "
What is joint hypermobility syndrome?,"'The joint hypermobility syndrome is a condition that features joints that easily move beyond the normal range expected for a particular joint. The joint hypermobility syndrome is considered a benign condition. It is estimated that 10%-15% of normal children have hypermobile joints or joints that can move beyond the normal range of motion. Hypermobile joints are sometimes referred to as ""loose joints,"" and those affected are referred to as being ""double jointed.""' "
What diseases are risk factors for joint hypermobility syndrome?,"'Joint hypermobility is also a feature of a rare, inherited, more significant medical condition called ''Ehlers-Danlos syndrome'' (EDS), which is characterized by ''weakness'' of the connective tissues of the body. Joint hypermobility is commonly seen in people with ''Down syndrome'' and in people with ''Marfan syndrome''.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of joint hypermobility?,"'Because the joints are capable of excessive motion in people with the joint hypermobility syndrome, they are susceptible to injury. Symptoms of the joint hypermobility syndrome include ''pain'' in the knees, fingers, hips, and elbows. There is a higher incidence of joint dislocation and ''sprains'' of involved joints. ''Scoliosis'' (curvature of the spine) occurs more frequently in people with hypermobile joints and can lead to ''back pain''. Joint hypermobility tends to decrease with ''aging'' as we become naturally less flexible.''Signs of the syndrome are the ability to place the palms of the hands on the floor with the knees fully extended, hyperextension of the knee or elbow beyond 10 degrees, and the ability to touch the thumb to the forearm.'  "
What causes joint hypermobility syndrome?,"'Hypermobile joints tend to be inherited in specific genes passed on by parents to their children. It is felt that these certain genes predispose to the development of hypermobile joints. As a result, there is a tendency of the condition to run in families (familial). Genes that are responsible for the production of collagen, an important protein that helps to glue tissues together, are suspected of playing a role.'  "
What tests diagnose joint hypermobility syndrome?,"'Joint hypermobility syndrome is diagnosed by examining affected joints and noting that they easily move beyond the normal range expected. For example, the middle of the fingers may bend backward more than usual. There is no blood test for hypermobility syndrome.' "
What is the treatment for hypermobility syndrome?,"'Often joint hypermobility causes no symptoms and requires no treatment. Many individuals with joint hypermobility syndrome improve in adulthood. Treatments are customized for each individual based on their particular manifestations. ''Joint pains'' can be relieved by medications for pain or inflammation. Proper physical ''fitness'' ''exercise'' should be designed to avoid injury to joints. Home remedies include home exercises and ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), as needed. Sometimes physical therapy can help with rehabilitation of injured areas and can be especially helpful to prevent reinjury.'  "
What is the prognosis for joint hypermobility syndrome?,"'Frequently, there are no long-term consequences of joint hypermobility syndrome. However, hypermobile joints can lead to ''joint pain''. Over time, joint hypermobility can lead to degenerative cartilage and ''arthritis''. Certain hypermobile joints can be at risk for injury, such sprained ligaments.' "
Which types of doctors treat hypermobility syndrome?,"'Doctors who treat hypermobility syndrome include general-medicine doctors, family medicine doctors, and internists, as well as ''rheumatologists'', orthopedists, and physical-medicine physicians.' "
Can you prevent joint hypermobility syndrome?,"'Because joint hypermobility syndrome is inherited, it is not preventable. Nevertheless, when joint hypermobility syndrome causes symptoms, ''prevention'' of injury and pain is possible by avoiding ''trauma'' and with appropriate treatments.' "
What is juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)?,"'Juvenile ''rheumatoid arthritis'' (JRA) is the umbrella term under which several forms of chronic ''arthritis'' in children are categorized. Regardless of type, all of these conditions have several historical and/or clinical characteristics in common. One or more joints must demonstrate evidence of inflammation characterized by ''swollen joints'', limitation in the range of motion of the involved joint(s), tenderness when the joint is moved, and increased warmth of the joint region. These symptoms must be present (even intermittently) for at least six weeks and affect a child less than 16 years of age.''JRA is the most frequent chronic rheumatologic disease of childhood, and the cause(s) are not well understood. Both environmental and genetic influences are felt to contribute to the development of signs and symptoms of JRA. Knowledgeable specialists (pediatric ''rheumatologists'' usually affiliated with pediatric teaching hospitals) can help to limit the possibility of complications of juvenile ''rheumatoid arthritis'' including leg-length discrepancy, joint contractures, and destruction and ''blindness'' due to inflammation of the eye (''iritis'').''Until the late 1990s, JIA was known in the U.S. as JRA (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) and JCA (juvenile chronic arthritis) in Europe. The revised name was devised in order to better distinguish the childhood disease from rheumatoid arthritis (''RA'') that affects adults. This new nomenclature has enabled the categorization of six JIA subtypes. This updated classification has helped to foster better communication among those doing research on causation, clinical manifestations, and therapy of JIA.'""JRA is considered a diagnosis of exclusion; the diagnosis can only be confidently made when (1) the patient's history, physical exam, and laboratory findings are consistent with those described in the literature by the International League of Associations for ""'Rheumatology'' and (2) other conditions have been excluded. These include infection, ''malignancy'', ''trauma'', ''reactive arthritis'', immunodeficiency, and other connective tissue/rheumatologic diseases (for example, ''systemic lupus erythematosus'').' "
What are the types of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)?,"'There are six broad categories of JRA. These include''The specific criteria necessary to establish a diagnosis and prognosis for each category are detailed below.' systemic onset 
	JRA, oligoarticular JRA (containing two subgroups), polyarticular 
	JRA (containing two subgroups), psoriatic arthritis, enthesitis related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis."
What are causes and risk factors of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) arthritis?,"'While no specific cause(s) of JRA have been determined, there is strong evidence of both genetic and environmental factors being implicated in the development of the disease. Studies of the frequency of JRA have shown that if one identical twin develops the disease that the likelihood of their identical sibling developing JRA is 25%-40%. Studies of nonidentical siblings show evidence that if one child develops JRA there is a 15 to 30 times increased risk that a sibling will develop the condition when compared to the general pediatric population.''The biologic and clinical manifestations of JRA provide strong evidence that a general theme of an immune system misdirection is evident. The immune system has two ""arms"" -- the cell based (lymphocytes, etc.) and humeral based (antibodies). Rheumatologists have demonstrated that both of these elements of the immune system react against the patient\'s own body structures (joints, muscles, eye tissues, etc.). Much research is currently focused in an effort to better understand this auto-inflammatory process in the hope that understanding the cause of JRA will enable better and more effective treatments and ultimately a cure for the condition.' "
What specialists treat juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)?,"'Members of the treatment team would include a pediatric ''rheumatologist'', a pediatric ophthalmologist, physical and occupational therapists, a pharmacologist, and a social worker/family counselor.' "
"What are juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) symptoms and signs, and how are the different types of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) diagnosed?","'The International League of Associations of Rheumatology has classified JRA into six distinct patterns that vary by clinical presentation and evolution of symptoms, laboratory implications, potential complications, and therapeutic options. While some similarities exist among these diseases, the uniqueness of each manifestation of JRA is strong enough to justify the breakdown into the six patterns. One characteristic common to all six forms of JRA is that of ""morning ''stiffness''"" that improves during the day as more movement is done. Likewise, spontaneous patterns of worsening and lessening of symptoms (which may be independent of therapy) is characteristic.''1. ''Systemic onset JRA'': By definition, systemic onset JRA must have arthritis (swelling, ''pain'', and warmth) of one or more joints associated with a minimum of two weeks of daily spiking ''fevers''. The ''fever'' is often greater than 102 F (39 C) and usually spikes once or twice a day and may have the unique pattern of returning to below normal between rises. In addition, a characteristic intermittent salmon-colored ''rash'';\xa0''swollen lymph nodes'', ''liver'', and spleen; and inflammation of the ''lungs'', the pericardium (the ""sack"" surrounding the ''heart''), and other organs may occur. During febrile episodes, children appear moderately sick, but with resolution of ''fever'' they are much improved. Systemic onset JRA affects approximately 10%-15% all children suffering from JRA. There is no gender preference (the frequency in boys and girls is equal), with symptoms generally starting between 3-5 years of age. There is no unique laboratory test for JRA, but children typically have ''anemia'' and elevation of white blood cell and platelet counts, as well as alterations of general markers of inflammation. Complications of systemic onset JRA may include slower than expected growth, weakening of bones, abnormalities of liver and lung function, and consequences of therapy (see below). The prognosis is generally noted to depend upon the severity of arthritis with many/most of the systemic symptoms resolving over months to years. The low mortality rate (<0.3% in North America) is reassuring. Since the diagnosis of systemic onset of JRA is one of exclusion, the possibility of infection, malignancy, ''collagen vascular disease'', and ''rheumatic fever'' must also be considered.''2. ''Oligoarticular JRA'': Oligoarticular is defined as arthritis that affects four or fewer joints in the first six months of the disease. This form of JRA accounts for about 50% of all cases of pediatric chronic arthritis and may be subdivided into two groups. One group consists of those children who continue throughout the entire course of their disease having four or fewer joints involved. The other group eventually develops greater than four-joint involvement after the first six months of illness. The onset of disease is between 2-4 years of age with a female gender bias of approximately 3:1. Children with oligoarticular JRA most commonly have a single large joint (knee in approximately 90% of cases) involvement. Symptoms of ''joint pain'' and tenderness are worse in the morning in association with the previously described morning stiffness (see systemic onset JRA). The primary complication of oligoarticular JRA is inflammation of the ''iris'' (the colored region of the eye). Iritis is found in approximately 15%-20% with this form of JRA and is often without symptoms. Complications of iritis may include clouding of the ''cornea'' (''cataracts''), ''glaucoma'', and ''vision loss''. Since outcome is linked to early diagnosis, it is imperative an ophthalmologist evaluate children with oligoarticular JRA every three to four months. Conditions that should be eliminated prior to establishing a diagnosis of oligoarticular JRA include trauma, infection, malignancy, and arthritis following an infection.''3. ''Polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis'': Children who have five or more joints involved with arthritis during the first six months of their disease are classified into the polyarticular JRA form of illness. Two subgroups of polyarticular JRA exist based upon a constellation of various laboratory studies. One group (rheumatoid factor ""RF"" positive) affects between 5%-10% of all patients with JRA. Late childhood through young teenage girls are the most likely to develop this pattern. Generally, small joints (such as the hands and ''feet'') tend to be involved, and a more aggressive course has been observed. ""RF negative"" polyarticular JRA affected individuals tend to have a milder course and thus a better outcome. ''Fatigue'', ''anemia'', suboptimal growth, and iritis (to a lesser degree than oligoarticular JRA) are complications. Other conditions that must be considered and eliminated prior to establishing the diagnosis of polyarticular JRA include infection, malignancy, and collagen ''vascular disease'' (including ''systemic lupus erythematosus'').''4. ''Psoriatic arthritis'' (PsA)'': Establishing the diagnosis of ''psoriatic arthritis'' involves demonstration of both large and small joint arthritis and a characteristic ''rash'' (''psoriasis''). Should the rash not be present, two of the following must exist: (a) family history of ''psoriasis'' in an immediate family member, (b) diffuse swelling of the fingers, and (c) pitting of the nails. Children with psoriatic arthritis may also develop iritis and should have ophthalmologic evaluation every six months.''5. ''Enthesitis''-related arthritis (ERA)'': Enthesitis (inflammation at the site of tendon insertion on the bone) most profoundly affects males over 8 years of age and often involves the lower back, sacroiliac joints, and joints of the legs, ankles, and feet. Patients with a particular genetic marker (HLA-B27) may also develop iritis, ''inflammatory bowel disease'', ''psoriasis'', and/or ''ankylosing spondylitis'' (inflammation of the pelvic joints -- most commonly the sacroiliac region). The male to female ratio is 7:1.''6. ''Undifferentiated arthritis'': Children who either do not fit clearly into the above unique subtypes of JRA or who have symptoms/laboratory studies that overlap more than one subtype are classified as having undifferentiated arthritis. By their nature, the patient population with this form of JRA often presents with nonclassical history and/or findings on physical exam and laboratory studies. Providing an accurate prognosis and developing a treatment program are challenges.'  "
What is the treatment for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)? What medications treat JRA?,"'While there currently is no cure for JRA, an integrated and coordinated approach has been shown to be helpful in lessening the morbidity (nonlethal side effects) of JRA. Goals include lessening ''pain'', joint contractures, and growth disturbances (see above). Monitoring for the development of iritis and aggressive treatment are also paramount. Often patients are best served at a pediatric teaching hospital where access to pediatric rheumatologists, physical and occupational therapists, pharmacologists, and social support providers may allow ""one stop shopping.""''Therapies for JRA patients include the following:''1. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') are commonly used as the first line of therapy due to their positive effect of reducing inflammation in arthritis and relatively few side effects. Medications such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin''), ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), and ''indomethacin'' (''Indocin'') are examples of this class of therapy.''2. Steroids are another common class of medications for those experiencing moderate to severe arthritis or nonarthritis inflammatory consequences of JRA. These medications may be administered orally (''prednisone'' [''Deltasone''], ''prednisolone'' [''Pediapred'']), intravenously (''methylprednisolone'' [''Solu-Medrol''], ''dexamethasone'' [Decadron], hydrocortisone [''Solu-Cortef'']), or injected directly into an involved joint (methylprednisolone [''Depo-Medrol''], triamcinolone [Kenalog]). Side effects of steroids may be considerable, and pediatric rheumatologists strive to use the lowest possible dosage. Side effects are most commonly seen at dosages over 20 mg/day and may include immune system ''depression'', ''increased appetite'' resulting in ''weight gain'', ''acne'', ''mood changes'', ''osteoporosis'', ''bruising'', ''cataracts'', ''glaucoma'', and ''diabetes''.''3. Antirheumatic medications (also known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or DMARDs) are needed in approximately two-thirds of children to control the joint changes and prevent damage of JRA. These medications are generally considered when the medications previously described are not providing effective control of the illness. Medicines in this category include ''methotrexate'' (''Trexall''), now considered the ""gold standard"" for JRA, ''sulfasalazine'' (Azulfidine), ''azathioprine'' (Imuran), ''cyclosporine'' (''Sandimmune'', ''Neoral''), and others. These medications are administered orally or intravenously. Antirheumatic medications are more potent in effect but also can have significant side effects. All of these medications require regular blood testing to monitor for side effects. Problems include immune suppression, which may cause an increased risk of infection, certain ''cancers'', bone marrow toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, ''liver function'' abnormalities, ''abdominal pain'', and decrease in appetite.''4. Biologic agents can lessen the morbidity for children with JRA. These agents are administered either by superficial injection under the skin or intravenously. Their general chemical classification is that of ""monoclonal antibodies"" that work by accurately targeting various mechanisms of the immune system that are overactive and misdirected in JRA. They are associated with an increased risk of infections and (rarely) development of certain malignancies. As such, close clinical monitoring and various laboratory studies are required. Examples of ''biologics'' used in the treatment of JRA include ''etanercept'' (''Enbrel''), ''anakinra'' (''Kineret''), ''adalimumab'' (''Humira''), ''tocilizumab'' (''Actemra''), and ''abatacept'' (''Orencia'').'""5. Autologous stem cell transplantation is reserved only for those children with JRA who have failed the above therapeutic options. This procedure requires hospitalization and is a two-step process. The initial goal is utilization of high-dose immune suppression medications to remove the patient's lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) that are attacking the patient's joint(s). Once removed, new ""'stem cells'"" from the patient (autologous) that were previously harvested and treated are introduced back into the patient's body via the bloodstream. This process requires expertise found only in a few pediatric referral centers.""  "
What are complications of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)?,"'Perhaps the most insidious and most devastating complication of JRA is a form of eye inflammation of the iris of the eye called iritis. The risk for iritis is variable depending upon the subtype of JRA. The highest risk group is oligoarticular JRA while patients with systemic onset JRA are at a low risk of this complication. It is imperative that all JRA patients have thorough ophthalmologic examinations in order to detect any changes that would herald the onset of iritis.''Another common complication of JRA is growth disturbances (such as a difference in leg lengths). Interestingly, the involved joint (such as the knee) has an increase in blood flow due to the inflammatory nature of the local arthritis. This increase in blood flow encourages the area of bone growth (growth plate) to maximum activity and thus the involved leg is longer than the non-involved limb. However, as the disease progresses, the chronic nature of arthritis can damage the growth plate region causing premature fusion and thus the involved leg will be retarded relative to the uninvolved limb. Many patients experience moderate pain of the joints involved resulting in limited use of the region. As a result, loss of calcium from the bone can result in ''osteoporosis''.''These children and their parents may also fall victim to emotional ''stress'' associated with any chronic illness. Long-term low-grade pain may stimulate a sense of helplessness and hopelessness and thus ''depression''. Children often have a limited social life (especially with their peers) due to school absenteeism.''It must also be remembered that the medical therapies commonly used to treat JRA can have many have prominent side effects (see above).' "
What is the prognosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)?,"'Approximately 50% of children with JRA continue to have active disease into adulthood. In patients who have active disease into adulthood, there can be significant disability with functional limitations. Outcome may reflect duration of disease, presence of polyarticular involvement, and the need for systemic steroids. In the United States and Canada, death is rare (29 out of 10,000 patients) and is most likely with systemic onset JRA.' "
Why Is Childhood Such an Important Time for Bone Development?,"'Bones are the framework for your child\'s growing body. Bone is living tissue that changes constantly, with bits of old bone being removed and replaced by new bone. You can think of bone as a bank account, where (with your help) your kids make ""deposits"" and ""withdrawals"" of bone tissue. During childhood and adolescence, much more bone is deposited than withdrawn as the skeleton grows in both size and density.''For most people, the amount of bone tissue in the skeleton (known as bone mass) peaks by their late twenties. At that point, bones have reached their maximum strength and density. Up to 90 percent of peak bone mass is acquired by age 18 in girls and age 20 in boys, which makes youth the best time for your kids to ""invest"" in their bone health.''Building your children\'s ""bone bank"" account is a lot like saving for their education: The more they can put away when they\'re young, the longer it should last as they get older.' "
What Is Osteoporosis? Isn't It Something Old People Get?,"'Osteoporosis'' is a disease that causes bones to become fragile and break easily. When someone has osteoporosis, it means his/her ""bank account"" of bone tissue has dropped to a low level. If there is significant bone loss, even ''sneezing'' or bending over to tie a shoe can cause a bone in the spine to break. Hips, ribs, and wrist bones also break easily. The fractures from osteoporosis can be painful and disfiguring. There is no cure for the disease.''Osteoporosis is most common in older people but can also occur in young and middle-aged adults. Optimizing peak bone mass and developing lifelong healthy bone behaviors during youth are important ways to help prevent or minimize osteoporosis risk as an adult.''Factors Affecting Peak Bone Mass'""Peak bone mass is influenced by a variety of factors: some that you can't change, like gender and race, and some that you can, like nutrition and physical activity.""'Gender:'' Bone mass or density is generally higher in men than in women. Before puberty, boys and girls develop bone mass at similar rates. After puberty, however, boys tend to acquire greater bone mass than girls.''Race: For reasons still not well understood, African American girls tend to achieve higher peak bone mass than Caucasian girls, and African American women are at lower risk for osteoporosis later in life. More research is needed to understand the differences in bone density between the various racial and ethnic groups. However, because all women, regardless of race, are at significant risk for osteoporosis, girls of all races need to build as much bone as possible to protect them against this disease.''Hormonal factors: ''Sex hormones, including estrogen and testosterone, are essential for the development of bone mass. Girls who start to menstruate at an early age typically have greater bone density. Those who frequently miss their menstrual periods sometimes have lower bone density.''Nutritional status: ''Calcium is an essential nutrient for bone health. In fact, calcium deficiencies in young people can account for a 5- to 10-percent lower peak bone mass and may increase the risk for bone fracture in later life. A well-balanced diet including adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals such as magnesium, zinc, and vitamin D is also important for bone health.''Physical activity: ''Physical activity is important for building healthy bones, and provides benefits that are most pronounced in the areas of the skeleton that bear the most weight. These areas include the hips during walking and running and the arms during gymnastics and weight lifting.' "
How Can I Help Keep My Kids' Bones Healthy?,"'The same healthy habits that keep your kids going and growing will also benefit their bones. One of the best ways to encourage healthy habits in your children is to be a good role model yourself. Believe it or not, your kids are watching, and your habits, both good and bad, have a strong influence on theirs.''The two most important lifelong bone health habits to encourage now are proper ''nutrition'' and plenty of physical activity.''Eating for healthy bones means getting plenty of foods that are rich in calcium and ''vitamin D''. Most kids get enough ''vitamin D'' from sunlight (or from foods like egg yolks or fortified milk), but most do not get enough calcium in their diets to help ensure optimal peak bone mass. Are your kids getting enough calcium?''Source: National Academy of Sciences, 1997.''Calcium is found in many foods, but the most common source is milk and other dairy products. Drinking one 8-oz glass of milk provides 300 milligrams (mg) of calcium, which is about one-third of the recommended intake for younger children and about one-fourth of the recommended intake for ''teens''. In addition, milk supplies other minerals and ''vitamins'' needed by the body. The chart on the next page lists the calcium content for several high-calcium foods and ''beverages''. Your kids need several servings of these foods each day to meet their need for calcium. ' "
How Can I Persuade My Daughter to Drink Milk Instead of Diet Soda? She Thinks Milk Will Make Her Fat.,"'Soft ''drinks'' tend to displace calcium-rich beverages in the diets of many children and adolescents. In fact, research has shown that girls who drink soft drinks consume much less calcium than those who do not.'""It's important for your daughter to know that good sources of calcium don't have to be fattening. Skim milk, low-fat cheeses and yogurt, calcium-fortified juices and cereals, and green leafy vegetables can all fit easily into a healthy, low-fat ""'diet''. Replacing even one soda each day with milk or a milk-based fruit smoothie can significantly increase her calcium intake.' "
But My Kids Don't Like Milk.,"""Drinking milk isn't the only way to enjoy its benefits. For example, try making soup and oatmeal or other hot cereals with milk instead of water. Pour milk over ""'cold'"" cereal for breakfast or a snack. Incorporate milk into a fruit smoothie or milkshake. Chocolate milk and cocoa made with milk are also ways to increase the milk in your child's diet. ""'Sources of calcium also might include an ounce or two of cheese on pizza or a cheeseburger, a cup of calcium-enriched orange juice, or a small carton of yogurt. Your kids can also get calcium from dark green, leafy vegetables like kale or bok choy, or foods such as broccoli, almonds, tortillas, or tofu made with calcium. Many popular foods such as cereals, breads, and juices now have calcium added too. Check the Nutrition Facts label on the package to be sure.' "
"My Teenage Son Loves Milk, But It Seems to Upset His Stomach. Could He Have Lactose Intolerance?","'People with ''lactose intolerance'' have trouble digesting lactose, the ''sugar'' found in milk and dairy foods. Lactose intolerance is not common among infants and young children, but can occur in older children, adolescents, and adults. It is more common among people of African American, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian descent.''Most kids with lactose intolerance are able to digest milk when it is served in small amounts, and combined with other foods like cereal. They may tolerate other dairy products such as cheese or yogurt even if milk is a problem. Lactose-free milk products are now available in most stores, and there are pills and drops you can add to milk and dairy products that make them easier to digest.'""Be sure to include plenty of foods with calcium in the meals and snacks you plan for your kids. Almonds, calcium-fortified orange juice, tortillas, fortified cereals, soy beverages, and broccoli with dip are a few great choices. Although it's best to get calcium from food, ""'calcium supplements'' can also be helpful.''How to Read a Food Label for Calcium''The food label, called Nutrition Facts, shows you how much one serving of that food contributes to the total amount of calcium, as well as other nutrients, you need every day. This is expressed as a percentage of the daily value (%DV) of calcium that is recommended. For labeling purposes, this is based on the daily calcium recommendation of 1,000 milligrams for people 19 to 50 years old. Since children and teens 9 to 18 years old require more calcium, their %DV target is higher, as indicated below:''Here is an easy rule of thumb for evaluating the calcium content of a food: 20%DV or more is high for calcium. That means it is a high-calcium food and contributes a lot of calcium to the diet. A food with a calcium content of 5%DV or lower contributes little calcium to the diet and is a low source.''If you want to convert the %DV for calcium into milligrams, you can multiply by 10. For example, if a single-serving container of yogurt lists 30%DV for calcium, it contains 300 mg of calcium (30 x 10).''Getting plenty of high-calcium foods every day is important. To meet their calcium needs, children 9 to 18 years old need about four servings of foods with a 30%DV for calcium (300 mg each) or six to seven servings of foods with a 20%DV for calcium (200 mg each) every day. Foods with a lower %DV for calcium are also important to fill gaps and help ensure that your children get all the calcium they need.' "
My Daughter Is Constantly Dieting. Should I Be Concerned?,"'Maintaining proper weight is important to overall health, but so is good nutrition. If your daughter is avoiding all milk and dairy products and severely restricting her food intake, she is probably not getting enough calcium. She needs a more balanced diet that includes low-fat milk products and other calcium-rich foods. Calcium ''supplements'' may also be helpful to ensure that she gets enough of this essential nutrient. '""You should discuss your concerns with your daughter's doctor. If your daughter is one of up to 3 percent of American girls and young women with eating disorders, the problem is even more serious. ""'Eating disorders'', especially  ''anorexia'' nervosa, can lead to missed or irregular menstrual periods or the complete absence of periods, known as ''amenorrhea''. These are signs of low estrogen, a hormone that is essential for developing bone density and reaching peak bone mass. Girls with ''anorexia'"" nervosa will often have fractures as a first sign of the disease. Furthermore, reduction in estrogen production in adolescence can increase your daughter's risk of osteoporosis and fracture later in life. In severe cases, girls with eating disorders may even develop osteoporosis in their twenties, and they may find the damage to their bones cannot be reversed later in life. """"Look for the following signs and see your daughter's physician if you think your daughter has, or is at risk of developing, an eating disorder: "" missed menstrual periods after having had them regularly for at least several 
months extreme and/or unhealthy-looking thinness extreme or rapid weight loss frequent dieting practices such as eating very little not eating in front of 
others trips to the bathroom following meals preoccupation with thinness focus 
on low-calorie and diet foods overtraining or excessive exercise."
"Should I Give 
My Kids Calcium Supplements?","'Experts believe calcium should come from food sources whenever possible. However, if you think your children are not getting adequate calcium from their diet, you may want to consider a calcium supplement. For optimal absorption, no more than 500 mg of calcium should be taken at one time. ' "
How Does Physical Activity Help My Kids' Bones?,"'Muscles get stronger when we use them. The same idea applies to bones: the more work they do, the stronger they get. Any kind of physical ''exercise'' is great for your kids, but the best ones for their bones are weight-bearing activities like walking, running, hiking, dancing, tennis, basketball, gymnastics, and soccer. (Children who tend to play outside will also have higher vitamin D levels.) ''Swimming'"" and bicycling promote your kids' general health, but are not weight-bearing exercises and will not help build bone density. Organized sports can be fun and build confidence, but they are not the only way to build healthy bones.""'The most important thing is for your kids to spend less time sitting and more time on their ''feet'' and moving. Alone or with friends, at home or at the park, one of the best gifts you can give your kids is a lifelong love of physical activity.''Bone-Building Activities'  Walking Tennis Running Volleyball Hiking Ice hockey/field hockey Dancing Skiing Soccer Skateboarding Gymnastics In-line skating Basketball Lifting weights Jumping rope Aerobics"
Is It Possible to Get Too Much Exercise?,"'For most people, including children and teens, the challenge is to get enough physical activity. However, excessive exercise and overtraining, often coupled with restrictive eating, can be a problem, especially for some female athletes and dancers, as well as girls who become obsessive about ''weight loss''. Overtraining, like eating disorders, can result in decreased estrogen and eventually lead to thin bones that break easily. ''Years ago, it was not unusual for coaches and trainers to encourage athletes to be as thin as possible for many sports, including dancing, gymnastics, figure skating, running, and diving. Fortunately, many coaches now realize that being too thin is unhealthy and can negatively affect performance as well as lifelong health. ' "
What Else Can My Kids Do Besides Eating Calcium-Rich Foods and Getting Plenty of Weight-Bearing Exercise to Keep Their Bones Healthy?,"'They should avoid ''smoking''. You probably know that ''smoking'' is bad for the heart and ''lungs'"", but you may not know that it's harmful to bone tissue. ""'Smoking'' may harm your bones both directly and indirectly. Several studies have linked smoking to higher risk of fracture. The many dangers associated with smoking make it a habit to be avoided.'""You may think it's too early to worry about smoking, but the habit typically starts during childhood or adolescence. In fact, most people who use ""'tobacco'' products start before they finish high school. The good news? If your kids finish high school as nonsmokers, they will probably stay that way for life. ''Children who learn good eating and exercise habits by their preteen years are more likely to carry these habits with them for the rest of their lives.' "
"My Son Has Asthma and Takes a Steroid Medication to Control It. His Doctor 
Said This Might Affect His Bones. Is There Anything We Can Do About This?","'Asthma'' itself does not pose a threat to bone health, but some medications used to treat the disease can have a negative effect on bones when taken for a long time. ''Corticosteroids'', a type of anti-inflammatory medication, are often prescribed for ''asthma'"". These medications can decrease calcium absorbed from food, increase calcium loss from the kidneys, and shrink a child's bone bank account. ""'Kids with ''asthma'' need to take special care of their bones, making sure to get enough calcium and weight-bearing exercise. Some health care providers recommend extra calcium each day: between 1,000 and 1,500 mg. Many people think milk and dairy products – great sources of calcium and vitamin D – trigger asthma attacks, but this is probably true only if your child is ''allergic'' to dairy foods. Unfortunately, this misconception often results in an unnecessary avoidance of dairy products, which is especially risky for kids with asthma, who need extra calcium during their bone-building years. ''Because exercise can often trigger an ''asthma attack'', many people with asthma avoid weight-bearing physical activities that strengthen bone. Kids with asthma may be able to exercise more comfortably in an air-conditioned place, such as a school gym or health club. '""Talk to your child's doctor for more information about protecting his bones while he is taking ""'asthma medications''. ' "
"My 8-Year-Old Son Is a Daredevil and Has Already Broken Several Bones. Could 
He Have a Problem Like Osteoporosis at This Young Age?","'Osteoporosis is rare among children and adolescents. When it occurs, it is usually caused by an underlying medical disorder or by medications used to treat such disorders. This is called secondary osteoporosis. It may also be the result of a genetic disorder such as osteogenesis imperfecta, in which bones break easily from little or no apparent cause. Sometimes there is no identifiable cause of juvenile osteoporosis. This is known as idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. Two or more low-impact fractures may be a sign of one of these disorders. '""If you are concerned about your son's frequent fractures, talk to his doctor for more information. "" "
How Can I Get Through to My Kids? They Sure Don't Think About Their Bones.,"'You are absolutely right. Research has shown that children and adolescents do not tend to think much about their health. Their decisions about diet and exercise, for example, are rarely made based on ""what\'s good for them."" But we also know that you have a much greater influence on your kids\' decisions and behaviors than you may believe. For example, many teenagers, when asked who has been the greatest influence in their life, name parents before friends, siblings, grandparents, and romantic partners.''Disorders, Medications, and Behaviors That May Affect Peak Bone Mass''The best way to help your kids develop healthy habits for life is to be a good role model. Research suggests that active children have active parents. If you make physical activity a priority and try hard to maintain a healthy diet, including plenty of calcium, chances are your positive lifestyle will ""rub off"" on them along the way. Here are some things you can do:' Be a role model. Drink milk with meals, eat calcium-rich snacks, and get plenty of weight-bearing exercise. Don't smoke. Incorporate calcium-rich foods into family meals. Serve fat-free or low-fat milk with meals and snacks. Stock up on calcium-rich snacks that are easy for hungry children to find, such as:cheese cubes and string cheesesingle-serving puddingsyogurt and frozen yogurtcereal with low-fat milkbroccoli with yogurt dipcalcium-fortified orange juiceindividual cheese pizzastortillasalmonds. cheese cubes and string cheese single-serving puddings yogurt and frozen yogurt cereal with low-fat milk broccoli with yogurt dip calcium-fortified orange juice individual cheese pizzas tortillas almonds. Help your kids to find a variety of physical activities or sports they enjoy participating in. Establish a firm time limit for sedentary activities such as TV, computers, and video games. Teach your kids to never start smoking, as it is highly addictive and toxic. Look for signs of eating disorders and overtraining, especially in preteen and teenage girls, and address these problems right away. Talk to your children's pediatrician about their bone health. If your child has a special medical condition that may interfere with bone mass development, ask the doctor for ways to minimize the problem and protect your child's bone health. Talk to your children about their bone health, and let them know it is a priority for you. Your kids may not think much about health, but they are probably attracted to such health benefits as energy, confidence, good looks, and strength."
