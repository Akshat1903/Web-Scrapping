What is paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'The ''heart'' is a two-stage electrical pump. A coordinated electrical signal is required for the heart muscle cells to contract in a coordinated way and generate a heartbeat. Normally, an electrical signal is generated in special ''pacemaker'' cells found in the sinoatrial (SA) node located in the ''right atrium'' or upper chamber of the heart. This impulse spreads to the whole atrial muscle causing it to contract and push blood into the ventricle or the lower chamber of the heart. The electrical signal continues to a junction box between the ''atrium'' and ventricle (the ''AV node''), where there is a slight delay that allows the ventricle to fill before it contracts and pumps blood to the body. The signal continues throughout the ventricles and causes them to beat and push blood to the body. '  "
What causes paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'In paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), abnormal conduction of that electricity causes the ''atrium'', and secondarily the ventricles, to beat very rapidly. It is referred to as paroxysmal, because the rapid rate can occur sporadically and without warning and may also stop on its own. The rapid heartbeat may last a few seconds or many hours. Often the PSVT resolves before the patient reaches a health care professional.''In many patients with PSVT, there is a “wiring” problem in the ''AV node'' and instead of having just one pathway for electricity to travel to the ventricle, there are two. This allows electricity to circle back and cause the ''atrium'' to beat more quickly than it should normally. PSVT is one of many electrical abnormalities that cause the atrium to beat too quickly. These abnormalities were once lumped together and called paroxysmal atrial tachycardia or PAT but, as more has been learned about the electrical wiring of the heart, terminology has been updated to better reflect the specific abnormal rhythm.''Some examples include''As well, there are numerous abnormalities in the ''AV node'' that cause rapid heartbeats and ''palpitations''. PSVT and other electrical abnormalities located in the atrium or AV node should not be confused with ventricular tachycardia, which arises from the ventricle and is potentially life-threatening.' atrial tachycardia, multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome."
What are the symptoms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'One of the most common symptom of\xa0PSVT is heart ''palpitations'', often described as a ""rapid heartbeat."" There can also be a fullness in the throat that is associated with the rapid heartbeat.''Other symptoms include the following:''The symptoms of PSVT usually occur while the heart is beating quickly, but the ''fatigue'' can persist after the heartbeat returns to normal. By its nature, PSVT is intermittent and its onset cannot be predicted. As well, once the heart starts to beat quickly, there is no way of predicting if and when it will return to normal rhythm on its own. Some patients are unaware that their heart is beating quickly and PSVT is found only when the patient presents for care and is found to have a rapid heartbeat.'   Lightheadedness, Weakness and fatigue Shortness of breath Chest pressure Syncope (passing out)"
How is paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of PSVT is based upon interpretation of the heart rate monitor and ''electrocardiogram''.'""Sometimes the diagnosis is difficult because the rapid heart rate resolves before the patient presents for medical care. In these cases, where there is a recurrent pattern of palpitations, the healthcare professional may suggest monitoring the patient's heart rate and rhythm as an outpatient. A Holter monitor is a small device that can be worn for 24 or 48 hours that records every heartbeat and may give a clue as to the underlying cause of the palpitations.""'A 30-day event monitor may also be considered, which gives a longer window to detect the rhythm. Again, a small monitor is worn, but with this device the patient triggers the recording when the palpitations begin. In some cases, specialized electrophysiology tests may be necessary to monitor the heart and try to reproduce abnormal rhythms.''For infrequent events, an implantable device (LINQ) can be placed just under the skin, and can scan for a month looking for rare rhythm changes.'  "
What is the treatment for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)?,"'There is a stepwise approach to treating the rapid heartbeat of PSVT. ''Vasovagal'"" maneuvers stimulate the vagus nerve and can slow the heart rate. Some options include holding one's breath and bearing down as if to have a bowel movement or splashing ""'cold'' water on the face. A care professional might cautiously ''massage'' the carotid artery in the neck, but in older patients, there is a risk of ''stroke'' and this procedure is usually reserved for younger patients.''Depending upon the heart rhythm, medications can be injected intravenously to reset the AV node or to decrease heart muscle excitability. Adenosine is a short-acting medication that is commonly used as a first-line drug to treat PSVT. Other treatment options for other atrial tachycardias include ''calcium channel blockers'', ''beta blockers'', ''digoxin'', and ''amiodarone''.''If the PSVT does not convert with intravenous medication or if the patient has ''low blood pressure'' or complains of ''chest pain'' or shortness of breath, ''cardioversion'' may be required. This means that an electrical ''shock'"" is given that resets the heart's electrical system to beat with a regular rate and rhythm.""  "
How can paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) be prevented?,"'PSVT can result because of underlying medical conditions or because of foods and medications that are ingested. ''Caffeine'', ''alcohol'', and ''over-the-counter'"" (OTC) cold medications that contain pseudoephedrine can stimulate and irritate the heart's electrical conduction system and precipitate an episode of PSVT. Decreasing or avoiding use of these chemicals completely may prevent PSVT. ""'Electrolytes'' abnormalities can cause heart electrical irritability. Abnormal thyroid levels can also precipitate ''abnormal heart rhythms''.''Medications can be used to minimize the recurrence of PSVT, including calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, or other antiarrhythmic medications.'""If PSVT continues to recur, an electrophysiologic study (EPS) can be done by a cardiologist and the electrical system of the heart can be mapped. If abnormal tracts or short circuits are found, they can be ablated or destroyed with high frequency radio waves and hopefully, prevent future episodes of PSVT. This is often a highly effective modality for patients with recurrent episodes who don't wish to have to take long-term medication."" "

Facts you should know about Takayasu disease," Takayasu disease is a chronic inflammation of the large blood vessels that distributes blood from the heart. The cause of Takayasu disease is unknown. Symptoms of Takayasu disease include painful, cool, or blanched extremities, dizziness, headaches, chest pain, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis of Takayasu disease involves detecting abnormal narrowing of the characteristic blood vessels. The treatment of Takayasu disease involves suppressing the inflammation in the blood vessels. Surgical procedures can be required."
What is Takayasu disease?,"'Takayasu disease is a chronic inflammation of the large blood vessels that distribute blood from the heart, including the ''aorta'' and its main branches. Inflammation of blood vessels is also called ''vasculitis''. It is most common in women of Asian descent. It usually begins between 10 and 30 years of age.'""Takayasu disease has also been referred to as pulseless disease, aortic arch syndrome, Takayasu's disease, and Takayasu's arteritis."" "
What causes Takayasu disease?,'The cause of Takayasu disease is unknown. The immune system in patients with Takayasu disease seems to be misdirected to cause inflammation of arteries (arteritis). White blood cells called T lymphocytes are part of the inflammation.' 
What are symptoms of Takayasu disease?,"'The inflammation of the aorta and its branch arteries can lead to poor blood supply to tissues of the body in patients with Takayasu disease. This can cause painful, cool, or blanched extremities, ''dizziness'', ''headaches'', ''chest pain'', and ''abdominal pain''. Other symptoms can include ''fatigue'', ''weight loss'', and low-grade ''fever''.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose Takayasu disease?,"'The doctor can find elevated ''blood pressure'' in over half of the patients with Takayasu disease. Abnormal sounds of blood movement through narrowed blood vessels can be heard sometimes with a stethoscope. Small notches in the ribs of the back of the chest have sometimes been detected on routine chest ''X-rays'' and are felt to be a result of abnormal pulsations of blood vessels in these areas.''The diagnosis is supported by the blood tests, such as a ''sedimentation rate'' (sed rate), that suggest inflammation in the body. In fact, elevated blood pressure with an elevated sedimentation rate is distinctly uncommon in children and very helpful in suggesting Takayasu disease as a possible cause. ''Anemia'' (''low red blood cell count'') is frequent.''Takayasu arteritis is ultimately diagnosed with an ''angiogram'' of the arteries (''arteriogram'') whereby a contrast material is injected into the blood vessels which makes them visible by X-ray. With the arteriogram, the doctor can visualize the abnormally narrowed and constricted arteries. The diagnosis of Takayasu disease can be aided by magnetic resonance ''angiography'' (MRA, the combination of an ''MRI'' scan with angiogram) and CT angiography. These are noninvasive methods of diagnosing and monitoring patients with Takayasu disease.' "
What are treatment options for Takayasu disease?,"'The treatment of Takayasu disease involves suppressing the inflammation with cortisone medication (''prednisone'', ''prednisolone''). While most patients can improve, some do not or relapse. In cortisone-resistant patients, stronger medications which suppress the immune system (immunosuppressive ''drugs''), thereby further decreasing active inflammation of the arteries, have been used. Examples include ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall''), ''cyclosporine'', ''cyclophosphamide'' (''Cytoxan''), and ''azathioprine'' (Imuran). Strict control of elevated blood pressure (''hypertension'') is important.''Vascular surgery procedures and/or ''angioplasty'' with ''stents'' can be required to treat aneurysms and severe blood vessel narrowing.'  "
What is the long-term prognosis for patients with Takayasu disease?,"'The long-term prognosis is not predictable. Some researchers have found that the prognosis is worse when the retinas of the eyes are affected, if the aorta is damaged, or when aneurysms develop. There is also some research that indicates that earlier, aggressive treatment with cortisone and immune-suppression medications may decrease the chances for requiring future surgical procedures for the blood-vessel abnormalities.''The effects of Takayasu arteritis vary greatly from patient to patient. These effects frequently depend on the impaired blood supply to body tissues (such as the brain leading to ''strokes'' or spinal cord leading to ''paralysis'').' "
Is it possible to prevent Takayasu disease?,"'Because the cause of Takayasu disease is not known, there is no current means of ''prevention''.' "

Questions to Ask Your Dentist About Your Medication,"'Review the medication information sheet that comes with each prescription.Write down any side effects you experience and call your dentist to discussthem. Update and review your history every time you see your dentist.' What is the name of the medication? Why do I need to take it? How often should I take it? What time of day should I take it? Should I take it on an empty stomach or with meals? Where should I store the medication? What should I do if I forget to take a dose? How long should I expect to take the medication? How will I know it is working? What common side effects should I expect? Are there any rare, but serious side effects to watch for? Will the medication interfere with driving, working or other activities? Does the medication interact with any foods, alcohol or other beverages, or other medications, vitamins, supplements, over-the-counter products, herbal products, or eye drops?"
Facts to Tell Your Dentist About Yourself," If you are taking any other medications, supplements, vitamins, herbal products, over-the-counter products, eye drops, or prescription skin lotions. If you are allergic to any medications. If you are pregnant or think you might be pregnant. If you have problems taking any medications. If you have any health-related problems or medical conditions, especially any serious conditions that affect your body's major organs -- the kidneys, lungs, heart or liver."
Safety Guidelines for Taking Medications in General,"'Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Edited by Charlotte E. Grayson, MD, February 2003, WebMD.''  Portions of this page ©  ''The Cleveland Clinic''  2000-2003' Keep an updated list of all your medications and their dosages with you. Take your medications exactly as prescribed. Do not stop taking your medications unless you talk to your dentist first. Stopping your medication too early can cause the illness to return or make it more difficult to treat. Do not double the dose of your medication. If you miss a dose of your medication at the scheduled time, don't panic. Take it as soon as you remember. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and return to your regular medication schedule. Do not keep outdated medication or medication that is no longer needed. Throw old medicines away. Store medications in a dry area away from moisture (unless your dentist or pharmacist tells you the medicine needs to be refrigerated). Always keep medications out of the reach of children. Contact your dentist immediately if you experience any unusual side effects after taking your medication. Do not share your medications with others. If you store your medications in a container, label it with the medication name, dose, frequency and expiration date. Anticipate when your medications will be running out and have your prescriptions renewed as necessary. Use one pharmacy if possible. Keep your medications in your carry-on luggage when you travel. Do not pack your medications in a suitcase that is checked, in case the suitcase is lost. Take extra medication with you when you travel in case your flight is delayed and you need to stay away longer than planned."
What is tardive dyskinesia?,"'Dyskinesias are involuntary movements of the face (including lips, tongue, eyes), trunk, and extremities, which are identified in patients who have been treated with certain (''dopamine''-antagonist) medications.''Dyskinesias are difficult to control. Many different conditions can lead to dyskinetic movements, including ''rheumatic fever'', genetic disorders, or unusual disorders such as motor tics and paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia. Dyskinetic movements can include eye blinking or closure, mouth opening or lip pursing, involuntary tongue movements, or more pronounced movements of the extremities or trunk. Sometimes, dyskinetic movements can include sustained abnormal postures; in these cases, the movements are called ''dystonia''.''Tardive dyskinesias are a subgroup of dyskinesias that occur after exposure to certain types of medication. The most common medications that can lead to tardive dyskinesia include antipsychotic medications and medications used to treat chronic ''nausea''. This class of medications is often used to treat psychiatric conditions such as ''schizophrenia'', severe ''depression'' or ''anxiety'', or ''bipolar disorder''. Often stereotyped, these drug-induced movement disorders include orofacial dyskinesias, or involuntary movements of the mouth, eyes, and tongue. The movements can range from intermittent and infrequent to almost constant.' "
How common is tardive dyskinesia?,"'The number of people who develop tardive dyskinesia is unknown, but estimates suggest that about 5%-6% of those who take neuroleptic or ''anti-nausea'' medications may develop symptoms; this number rises to about 25% of the elderly population. Sometimes tardive dyskinesia isn’t seen until the medication is stopped (this is called withdrawal dyskinesia); others find that their symptoms resolve after restarting the medication or adjusting the dose (this is known as “masked tardive dyskinesia”).' "
What causes tardive dyskinesia?,"'Although medications can trigger tardive dyskinesia, the underlying reason or cause of tardive dyskinesia remains unknown. Scientists speculate that medication-induced changes to a specific region in the brain (''dopamine''-2 or D-2 receptors) may lead to the movements, but this theory has not been proven yet.' "
What are the medications that cause tardive dyskinesia?,"'While antipsychotic medications -- including first- and second-generation antipsychotics -- ''metoclopramide'', and ''antiemetics'' have been implicated in the onset of tardive dyskinesia, the underlying cause remains unclear.' "
What are the risk factors for tardive dyskinesia?,"'Risk factors for tardive dyskinesia include age, gender (older females are more likely to develop tardive dyskinesia, whereas younger males seem more likely to develop tardive ''dystonia''), duration of exposure to antipsychotic medications, dose of antipsychotic medications, ''cigarette smoking''.' "
What are tardive dyskinesia symptoms and signs?,"'There are many different symptoms associated with tardive dyskinesia, including:''The facial movements may interfere with speaking or eating.''Other symptoms or signs include:''When the person is distracted, the movements are often worse; however, if the affected person becomes aware of the movements, he or she is often able to stop or decrease the activity.'  Twisting movements of the tongue or tongue protrusion Lip pursing or smacking Grimacing Cheek bulging or “puffing out” Chewing actions Eye closure Involuntary actions of the hands or feet, including persistent finger movements or toe extension Shoulder shrugging Neck movements (including pulling the head back or pushing it forward) Rocking activity Hip movements In rare cases, irregular breathing Involuntary facial movements, especially tongue protrusion. In some cases, the tongue movements are so pronounced that the person’s tongue begins to grow, exacerbating the problems with protrusion. Lip pursing and grunting also are frequently identified in cases of tardive dyskinesia. Sometimes a person with tardive dyskinesia will appear to be chewing on something."
What is the difference between dystonia and tardive dyskinesia?,"'When patients develop sustained twisting or abnormal postures related to medication use, a diagnosis of tardive ''dystonia'' may be made.' "
Akathisia vs. tardive dyskinesia,"'Akathisia is a sense of pronounced restlessness and an inability to sit still. People with akathisia will often pace, fidget, or march for hours on end. Unlike tardive dyskinesia, which occurs after several months or years of treatment, akathisia may arise after a single dose of a medication. Akathisia may be described as acute, occurring shortly after starting a medication, or tardive, occurring many months or years after starting the medication.' "
What specialists treat tardive dyskinesia?,"'Psychiatrists and neurologists, especially those who specialize in treating movement disorders, are most experienced in treating tardive dyskinesia.' "
How is tardive dyskinesia diagnosed?,"'Tardive dyskinesia is diagnosed after careful clinical examination and assessment of a patient’s history. Health care professionals consider and exclude other movement disorders, including drug-induced movement disorders, prior to making a diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia.'  "
Is there a test for tardive dyskinesia?,"'Tardive dyskinesia is a clinical diagnosis, meaning that there are no blood tests, ''X-rays'', or other objective assessments which can confirm this condition. Physicians often use the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) to quantify movements, which appear to be tardive dyskinesia. This scale is a numeric score that grades involuntary movements from 0-4 in 10 different areas, including muscles of facial expression, lips/perioral area, jaw, tongue, upper extremities, lower extremities, neck, shoulders, hips, severity of overall movements, and patient awareness of the movements. Many sources suggest that patients who are treated with antipsychotic medications be rated prior to initiating treatment and every 3 months thereafter.''Health care professionals consider conditions such as ''thyroid disorders'', parathyroid conditions, Sydenham chorea, ''syphilis'', Wilson disease, and Meige syndrome (idiopathic orofacial ''dystonia'') prior to making a diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia, as treatment is much different in those conditions.' "
What are tardive dyskinesia treatment options?,"'Treatment of tardive dyskinesia is often difficult; in some cases, symptoms may escalate if a medication is stopped abruptly. Although discontinuation of the drug thought to be the cause of tardive dyskinesia is suggested followed by a trial of an alternate antipsychotic agent, this is not always a feasible solution for patients, and sometimes stopping the current antipsychotic medication may exacerbate the symptoms.' "
Is medication for tardive dyskinesia available?," Dopamine-depleting medications -- including tetrabenazine, deutetrabenazine, valbenazine, and reserpine -- can all be beneficial to help alleviate symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. Although tetrabenazine has been used for many years to treat tardive dyskinesia, it has not received FDA approval for this application. Deutetrabenazine and valbenazine are FDA-approved medications to treat tardive dyskinesia. Benzodiazepines may be of benefit for some patients. Botulinum toxin injections can be helpful for certain symptoms such as blepharospasm or isolated dystonia."
Are there natural remedies for tardive dyskinesia?,"'Some patients have successfully used ''Ginkgo'' biloba for control of their tardive dyskinesia. Researchers evaluated ''vitamin E'', but found it to be ineffective.' "
Is tardive dyskinesia reversible?,'Tardive dyskinesia can be treated or even reversed in many patients. Early identification and treatment of this condition are often most successful in controlling the symptoms.' 
Can tardive dyskinesia be prevented?,'The most effective strategy in controlling tardive dyskinesia is ''prevention''; this includes short-term use of antipsychotic medications and regular assessment of whether patients need to remain on the medication. Experts recommend that use of ''metoclopramide'' be limited to less than 3 months.' 
What research for tardive dyskinesia is underway?,"'Studies looking at the potential benefit of ''pyridoxine'', as well as attempting to quantify the incidence of tardive dyskinesia are underway. Further information can be found at clinicaltrials.gov.' "
What are the things to remember while reaching your target heart rate zone?," Never skip warming up or cooling down during exercising. Skipping these can cause muscle injury and chronic pain. Choose exercises that suit you. You can do muscle strength training and aerobic activities. Aim for at least twice a week strength training of all major muscles (such as triceps, biceps, and quadriceps). You can use free weights or do activities such as planks, squats, or lunges. There are two kinds of aerobic activities. You can do any one of these or a combination of these.Moderate aerobic activity: Get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity such as brisk walking or swimming.Vigorous physical activity: Get at least 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity such as jogging or running. Moderate aerobic activity: Get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity such as brisk walking or swimming. Vigorous physical activity: Get at least 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity such as jogging or running. Start with aiming for a lower range of your target heart rate zone (50%) and gradually build up till you can reach 85%. Listen to your body. Stop if you feel uncomfortable even when you are exercising in your target heart rate zone. Devices that measure your heart rate can malfunction. Some exercises may not be advised for people with back problems; talk to your fitness guide/doctor before you start. If you feel chest pain or shortness of breath while doing exercises in your target heart rate zone, do not push yourself too hard. Talk to your doctor to check if you have any problems with your heart or to know how intensely you should exercise.  Ask an exercise/fitness expert if high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is good for you. This kind of training involves each exercise (vigorous) of 15-60 seconds with short intervals of rest of about 10-30 seconds. In between, your trainer may include moderate exercises as well. This works very well if you have diabetes or are looking for weight loss. Before you start a vigorous exercise program to reach your target heart rate zone, make sure you speak to your doctor if youHave diabetes.Have conditions (such as high cholesterol levels and a sedentary lifestyle) that can make you more likely to get heart disease.Are a man over age 45 years.Are a woman over age 55 years.

How common are taste disorders?,"""Many of us take our sense of taste for granted, but a taste disorder can have a negative effect on your health and quality of life. If you are having a problem with your sense of taste, you are not alone. More than 200,000 people visit a doctor each year for problems with their ability to taste or smell. Scientists believe that up to 15 percent of adults might have a taste or smell problem, but many don't seek a doctor's help.""'The senses of taste and smell are very closely related. Most people who go to the doctor because they think they have lost their sense of taste are surprised to learn that they have a smell disorder instead.' "
How does your sense of taste work?,"'Your ability to taste comes from tiny molecules released when you chew, drink, or digest food; these molecules stimulate special sensory cells in the mouth and throat. These taste cells, or gustatory cells, are clustered within the taste buds of the tongue and roof of the mouth, and along the lining of the throat. Many of the small ''bumps'' on the tip of your tongue contain taste buds. At birth, you have about 10,000 taste buds, but after age 50, you may start to lose them.''When the taste cells are stimulated, they send messages through three specialized taste nerves to the brain, where specific tastes are identified. Taste cells have receptors that respond to one of at least five basic taste qualities: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami [oo-MOM-ee]. Umami, or savory, is the taste you get from glutamate, which is found in chicken broth, meat extracts, and some cheeses. A common misconception is that taste cells that respond to different tastes are found in separate regions of the tongue. In humans, the different types of taste cells are scattered throughout the tongue.''Taste quality is just one way that you experience a certain food. Another chemosensory mechanism, called the common chemical sense, involves thousands of nerve endings, especially on the moist surfaces of the eyes, nose, mouth, and throat. These nerve endings give rise to sensations such as the coolness of mint and the burning or irritation of chili peppers. Other specialized nerves create the sensations of heat, ''cold'"", and texture. When you eat, the sensations from the five taste qualities, together with the sensations from the common chemical sense and the sensations of heat, cold, and texture, combine with a food's aroma to produce a perception of flavor. It is flavor that lets you know whether you are eating a pear or an apple.""'Most people who think they have a taste disorder actually have a problem with smell. When you chew food, aromas are released that activate your sense of smell by way of a special channel that connects the roof of the throat to the nose. If this channel is blocked, such as when your nose is stuffed up by a cold or ''flu'"", odors can't reach sensory cells in the nose that are stimulated by smells. As a result, you lose much of our enjoyment of flavor. Without smell, foods tend to taste bland and have little or no flavor."" "
What are the taste disorders?,"""The most common taste disorder is phantom taste perception: a lingering, often unpleasant taste even though there is nothing in your mouth. People can also experience a reduced ability to taste sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami -- a condition called hypogeusia [hy-po-GYOO-zee-a]. Some people can't detect any tastes, which is called ageusia [ah-GYOO-zee-a]. True taste loss, however, is rare. Most often, people are experiencing a loss of smell instead of a loss of taste.""'In other disorders of the chemical senses, an odor, a taste, or a flavor may be distorted. Dysgeusia [dis-GYOO-zee-a] is a condition in which a foul, salty, rancid, or metallic taste sensation persists in the mouth. Dysgeusia is sometimes accompanied by ''burning mouth syndrome'', a condition in which a person experiences a painful burning sensation in the mouth. Although it can affect anyone, burning mouth syndrome is most common in middle-aged and older women.' "
What causes taste disorders?,"'Some people are born with taste disorders, but most develop them after an injury or illness. Among the causes of taste problems are:' Upper respiratory and middle ear infections Radiation therapy for cancers of the head and neck Exposure to certain chemicals, such as insecticides and some medications, including some common antibiotics and antihistamines Head injury Some surgeries to the ear, nose, and throat (such as middle ear surgery) or extraction of the third molar (wisdom tooth) Poor oral hygiene and dental problems."
How are taste disorders diagnosed?,"'Both taste and ''smell disorders'"" are diagnosed by an otolaryngologist (sometimes called an ENT), a doctor of the ear, nose, throat, head, and neck. An otolaryngologist can determine the extent of your taste disorder by measuring the lowest concentration of a taste quality that you can detect or recognize. You may be asked to compare the tastes of different substances or to note how the intensity of a taste grows when a substance's concentration is increased.""'Scientists have developed taste tests in which the patient responds to different chemical concentrations. This may involve a simple ""sip, spit, and rinse"" test, or chemicals may be applied directly to specific areas of the tongue.''An accurate assessment of your taste loss will include, among other things, a physical examination of your ears, nose, and throat; a dental examination and assessment of oral hygiene; a review of your health history; and a taste test supervised by a health care professional.' "
Can taste disorders be treated?,"'Diagnosis by an otolaryngologist is important to identify and treat the underlying cause of your disorder. If a certain medication is the cause, stopping or changing your medicine may help eliminate the problem. (Do not stop taking your medications unless directed by your doctor, however.) Often, the correction of a general medical problem can correct the loss of taste. For example, people who lose their sense of taste because of respiratory infections or ''allergies'"" may regain it when these conditions resolve. Occasionally, a person may recover his or her sense of taste spontaneously. Proper oral hygiene is important to regaining and maintaining a well-functioning sense of taste. If your taste disorder can't be successfully treated, counseling may help you adjust to your problem.""'If you lose some or all of your sense of taste, here are things you can try to make your food taste better:'  Prepare foods with a variety of colors and textures. Use aromatic herbs and hot spices to add more flavor; however, avoid adding more sugar or salt to foods. If your diet permits, add small amounts of cheese, bacon bits, butter, olive oil, or toasted nuts on vegetables. Avoid combination dishes, such as casseroles, that can hide individual flavors and dilute taste."
Are taste disorders serious?,"'Taste disorders can weaken or remove an early warning system that most of us take for granted. Taste helps you detect spoiled food or liquids and, for some people, the presence of ingredients to which they are ''allergic''.''Loss of taste can create serious health issues. A distorted sense of taste can be a risk factor for ''heart disease'', ''diabetes'', ''stroke'', and other illnesses that require sticking to a specific ''diet''. When taste is impaired, a person may change his or her eating habits. Some people may eat too little and ''lose weight'', while others may eat too much and gain weight.''Loss of taste can cause you to add too much ''sugar'' or salt to make food taste better. This can be a problem for people with certain medical conditions, such as ''diabetes'' or ''high blood pressure''. In severe cases, loss of taste can lead to ''depression''.''If you are experiencing a taste disorder, talk with your doctor.' "
What research is being done about taste disorders?,"'The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) supports basic and clinical investigations of smell and taste disorders at its laboratories in Bethesda, Maryland, and at universities and chemosensory research centers across the country. These chemosensory scientists are exploring how to:''Some recent chemosensory research focuses on identifying the key receptors expressed by taste cells and understanding how those receptors send signals to the brain. Researchers are also working to develop a better understanding of how sweet and bitter substances attach to their targeted receptors. This research holds promise for the development of sugar or salt substitutes that could help combat ''obesity'' or ''hypertension'', as well as the development of bitter blockers that could make life-saving medicines more acceptable to children. Taste cells -- as well as sensory cells that help you smell -- are the only sensory cells in the ''human body'' that are regularly replaced throughout life. Researchers are exploring how and why this happens so that they might find ways to replace other damaged sensory cells.''NIDCD-funded researchers have shown that small variations in our genetic code can raise or lower our sensitivity to sweet tastes, which might influence our desire for sweets. Scientists are also working to find out why some medications and medical procedures can have a harmful effect on our senses of taste and smell. They hope to develop treatments to help restore the sense of taste to people who have lost it.''Scientists are gaining a better understanding of why the same receptor that helps your tongue detect sweet taste can also be found in the human gut. NIDCD-funded scientists have shown that the sweet receptor helps the intestine to sense and absorb sugar and turn up the production of blood sugar-regulation hormones, including the hormone that regulates ''insulin'' release. Further research may help scientists develop ''drugs'' targeting the gut taste receptors to treat obesity and ''diabetes''.' Prevent the effects of aging on taste and smell. Develop new diagnostic tests. Understand associations between taste disorders and changes in diet and food preferences in the elderly or among people with chronic illnesses. Improve treatment methods and rehabilitation strategies."

Introduction,"'It is estimated that close to 10% of the U.S. population has some sort of ''tattoo''. Eventually, as many as 50% of them want to have laser ''tattoo'' removal.'""There is good news for those who have an unwanted body design. Newer laser tattoo removal techniques can eliminate your tattoo with minimal side effects. Here's how it works: lasers remove tattoos by breaking up the pigment colors of the tattoo with a high-intensity light beam.""'Black tattoo pigment absorbs all laser wavelengths, making it the easiest to treat. Other colors can only be treated by selected lasers based upon the pigment color.' "
"Who Can Benefit 
From Laser Tattoo Removal?","'Because each tattoo is unique, removal techniques must be tailored to suit each individual case. In the past, tattoos could be removed by a wide variety of methods but, in many cases, the ''scars'' were more unsightly than the tattoo itself.''Patients with previously treated tattoos may also be candidates for laser therapy. Tattoos that have not been effectively removed by other treatments or through home remedies may respond well to laser therapy providing the prior treatments did not result in excessive scarring.' "
"How 
Do I Find a Reputable Doctor to Do Laser Tattoo Removal?","'To have a tattoo removed, you want to make sure you find a reputable dermatologist or ''cosmetic surgery'' center to ensure proper treatment and care. If possible, you should obtain a recommendation from your family doctor for a dermatologist or skin surgery center that specializes in tattoo removal.' "
What Can I Expect During Laser Tattoo Removal?,"'Depending on the size and color of your tattoo, the number of treatments will vary. Your tattoo may be removed in two to four visits, though many more sessions may be necessary. You should schedule a consultation, during which time a trained professional will evaluate your personal situation and advise you on the process.'""Treatment with the laser varies from patient to patient depending on the age, size and type of tattoo (amateur or professional). The color of the patient's skin, as well as the depth to which the tattoo pigment extends, will also affect the removal technique.""'In general, this is what will happen during an office visit for tattoo removal using the newer lasers:''Most patients do not require any anesthesia. However, depending on the location of the tattoo and the ''pain'' threshold for the patient, the physician may elect to use some form of anesthesia (topical anesthesia cream or painkiller injections at the site of the procedure).' Protective eye shields are placed on the patient. The skin's reaction to the laser is tested to 
  determine the most effective energy for treatment. The treatment itself consists of placing a hand piece 
  against the surface of the skin and activating the laser light. As many 
  patients describe it, each pulse feels like a grease splatter or the snapping 
  of a rubber band against the skin. Smaller tattoos require fewer pulses while larger 
  ones require more. In either case, the tattoo requires several treatments and 
  multiple visits. At each treatment, the tattoo should become progressively 
  lighter. Immediately following treatment, an ice 
pack is applied to soothe the treated area. The patient will then be asked to 
apply a topical antibiotic cream or ointment. A bandage or patch will be used to 
protect the site and it should likewise be covered with a sun block when out in 
the sun."
What Are the Possible Side Effects of Laser Tattoo Removal?,"'There are minimal side effects to laser tattoo removal. However, you should consider these factors in your decision:' The tattoo removal site is at risk for infection. You 
  may also risk lack of complete pigment removal, and there is a slight chance 
  that the treatment can leave you with a permanent scar. You may also risk hypopigmentation, where the treated 
  skin is paler than surrounding skin, or hyperpigmentation, where the treated 
  skin is darker than surrounding skin. Cosmetic tattoos like lip liner, 
eyeliner and eyebrows may darken following treatment with tattoo removal lasers. 
Further treatment of the darkened tattoos usually results in fading."
"Is Laser 
Tattoo Removal Safe?","'Thanks to newer technology, laser tattoo removal has become much more effective with very little risk of scarring. Laser treatment is often safer than many traditional methods such as excision, ''dermabrasion'' or salabrasion (using moist gauze pads saturated with a salt solution to abrade the tattooed area) because of its unique ability to selectively treat pigment involved in the tattoo.''In many cases, certain colors may be more effectively removed than others. It is known that blue/black tattoos respond particularly well to laser treatment -- the response of other colors is under investigation.'""Remember, the information provided here is designed to provide general information only and is not a replacement for a doctor's advice. For details pertaining to your specific case, please arrange a consultation with a physician experienced in the use of tattoo lasers."" "
"Does 
Insurance Cover Laser Tattoo Removal?","'Since tattoo removal is a personal option in most cases and is considered a cosmetic procedure, most insurance carriers will not cover the process unless it is medically necessary. Physicians or surgery centers practicing tattoo removal may also require payment in full on the day of the procedure. If you are considering tattoo removal, be sure to discuss associated costs up front and obtain all charges in writing before you undergo any treatment.''WebMD Medical Reference' "
What is tuberculosis?,"'Tuberculosis (TB) is a multisystemic infectious disease caused by ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' (or TB, TB germs), a rod-shaped bacterium. TB (TB may stand for the disease or the bacteria that cause the disease) is the most common cause of infectious disease-related mortality worldwide (about 10 million people worldwide were sick with TB in 2017, and about 1.3 million people died from TB worldwide in 2017 according to the World Health Organization [WHO] and the CDC). ''HIV''-associated TB infections are a leading cause of death in ''HIV'' patients. ''TB symptoms'' can span such a wide range that TB is termed the ""great imitator"" by many who study infectious diseases because TB symptoms can mimic many other diseases. Additional terms describe TB. The terms include consumption, Pott\'s disease, active, latent, pulmonary, cutaneous, and others (see the following section), and they appear in both medical and nonmedical publications. In most instances, the different terms refer to a specific type of TB with some unique symptoms or findings. The most common site (about 85%) for TB to develop is in the pulmonary tract although it may infect other parts of the body. Humans are the only known hosts for ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' (although it can infect animals). The bacteria may stain weakly both gram-negative and gram-positive due to its cell surface so medical professionals use acid-fast stains to visualize the cells with a microscope.'""TB has likely been infecting humans for many centuries; evidence of TB infections has been found in cadavers that date back to about 8000 BC. The Greeks termed it as a wasting away disease (phthisis). For many European countries, TB caused death in about 25% of adults and was the leading cause of death in the U.S. until the early 1900s. Robert Koch discovered TB's cause, ""'Mycobacterium tuberculosis'"", in 1882. With increased understanding of TB, public health initiatives, treatment methods like isolation of patients (quarantine), and the development of drugs to treat TB, the incidence of the disease, especially in developed countries, has been markedly reduced. However, the CDC estimates one-third of the world's population is infected with TB with about 1.8 million deaths per year. About 60% of all TB-infected people are located in India, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Pakistan, and South Africa.""""There is a vast amount of detailed information available in the medical literature on all aspects of this potentially debilitating and lethal disease. The goal of this article is to introduce the reader to TB and help them to obtain a general knowledge about TB's cause, transmission, diagnostic tests, treatments, and prevention methods against tuberculosis infection."" "
Are there different types of tuberculosis (TB)?,"'There are many types of tuberculosis, but the main two types are termed either active or latent tuberculosis infection. Active TB is when the disease is actively producing symptoms and can be transmitted to other people; latent disease is when the person is infected with ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'"" bacteria, but the bacteria are not producing symptoms (usually due to the body's immune system suppressing the bacterial growth and spread) and have no TB bacteria in the sputum. People with latent TB usually cannot transfer ""'Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' bacteria to others unless the immune system fails; the failure causes reactivation (bacterial growth is no longer suppressed) that results in active TB so the person becomes contagious. Latent TB resembles ''chickenpox'' infection that goes dormant and may reactivate years later.''Many other types of TB exist in either the active or latent form. These types are named for the signs and for the body systems ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' preferentially infect, and these infection types vary from person to person. Consequently, pulmonary tuberculosis mainly infects the pulmonary system (''lungs''), cutaneous TB has skin symptoms, while miliary TB describes widespread small infected sites (lesions or granulomas about 1 mm-5 mm) found throughout body organs. It is not uncommon for some people to develop more than one type of active TB. More types will be listed in the symptoms and signs section below.''Atypical mycobacteria that may cause disease are the ''M. avium'' complex, ''M. fortuitum'' complex, and ''M. kansasii''.' "
What causes tuberculosis?,"'The cause of TB is infection of human tissue(s) by the bacterium ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'"" (mycobacteria or TB). These bacteria are slow growing, aerobic, and can grow within body cells (an intracellular parasitic bacterium). Its unique cell wall helps protect it from the body's defenses and gives mycobacteria the ability to retain certain dyes like fuchsin (a reddish dye) after an acid rinse that rarely happens with other bacterial, fungal, or parasitic genera.""'Mycobacteria that escape destruction by body defenses may be spread by blood or lymphatic pathways to most organs, with preference to those that oxygenate well (lungs, kidneys, and bones, for example). Typical TB lesions, termed granulomas, usually consist of a central necrotic area, then a zone with macrophages, giant Langerhans cells and lymphocytes that become surrounded by immature macrophages, plasma cells, and more lymphocytes. These granulomas also contain mycobacteria. In latent infections, a fibrous capsule usually surrounds the granulomas, and in some people, the granulomas calcify, but if the immune defenses fail initially or at a later time (reactivate), the bacteria continue to spread and disrupt organ functions.'  "
What are risk factors for tuberculosis?,"'Although TB is not easily spread, it is usually spread between people who are in close contact (working together or living together).''There are many risk factors for developing tuberculosis. Certain groups of people have a high risk, such as people who work in hospitals and other areas where TB-infected people may reside (jails, ''nursing'' homes, group homes for ''HIV'' patients, homeless shelters). Close association with drug users, or people with known TB infections are also at higher risk. Other people at high risk include the following:' Visitors and immigrants from areas known to have high incidence of TB Children and the elderly with weakened immune systems (especially those with a positive TB skin test, see below) Patients with HIV infection Drug abusers, especially IV drug abuse Head and neck cancer patients Transplant patients Diabetics Kidney disease patients People undergoing immunosuppressive therapy Silicosis"
What are tuberculosis symptoms and signs?,"'Although there are a number of TB types, pulmonary tuberculosis is responsible for the majority (about 85%) of TB infections. Consequently, pulmonary TB symptoms and signs may occur with or even before other types of TB are diagnosed. The classical clinical symptoms and signs of pulmonary TB may include the following:''Other types are loosely classified as extra pulmonary and often have symptoms that are nonspecific but frequently localized to the involved site. The following includes the signs and symptoms of additional types of TB:'   Fever Night sweats Cough (often chronic) Hemoptysis (coughing up bloody sputum) Decrease or loss of appetite Weight loss and/or muscle loss (unintentional) Fatigue and/or malaise Chest pain (pain while breathing) Shortness of breath Swollen lymph nodes Pneumonitis (may be the only symptom in the elderly). Skeletal TB (also termed Pott's disease): spinal pain, back stiffness, paralysis is possible TB meningitis: headaches (variable in length but persistent), mental changes, coma TB arthritis: usually pain in a single joint (hips and knees most common) Genitourinary TB: dysuria, flank pain, increased frequency, masses or lumps (granulomas) Gastrointestinal TB: difficulty swallowing, nonhealing ulcers, abdominal pain, malabsorption, diarrhea (may be bloody) Miliary TB: many small nodules widespread in organs that resemble millet seeds (hence its name) Pleural TB: empyema and pleural effusions Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB): patients infected with TB bacteria that are resistant to multiple drugs XDR TB: patients infected with TB bacteria that are resistant to some of the most effective anti-TB medications; XDR stands for extensively drug resistant Caseous TB: Necrotic (dead and dying) tissue that is infected with TB organisms has a soft, dry, and cheesy appearance. End-stage TB: Patients may suffer fever, constant coughing, shortness of breath, weight loss, mental changes, and blood in their sputum before death."
"Is TB contagious, and how long is the incubation period and contagious period?","'TB is contagious and can be spread to others by airborne droplets during ''sneezing'', coughing, and contact with sputum, so you can get the disease by close contact with infected people; outbreaks occur in crowded conditions. The incubation period may vary from about two to 12 weeks. A person may remain contagious for a long time (as long as viable TB bacteria are present in sputum) and can remain contagious until they have been on appropriate therapy for several weeks. However, some people may be infected but suppress the infection and develop symptoms years later; some never develop symptoms or become contagious.' "
How do physicians diagnose tuberculosis? What is involved with TB testing?,"""Because TB may occur as either a latent or active form, the definitive diagnosis of active tuberculosis depends on the culture of mycobacteria from sputum or tissue biopsy. However, it may take weeks for these slow-growing bacteria to grow on specialized media. Since patients with latent TB do not require isolation or immediate drug therapy, it is useful to determine if a person is either not infected, has a latent infection, or is actively infected with transmissible TB bacteria. Consequently, doctors needed a presumptive test(s) that could reasonably assure that the person was infected or not so therapy could begin. After getting a patient's history and physical exam data, the next usual test is the skin test (termed the Mantoux tuberculin skin test or the tuberculin skin test or TST, sometimes referred to as a PPD test). The test involves injecting tuberculin (an extract made from killed mycobacteria) into the skin. In about 48-72 hours, the skin is examined for induration (swelling) by a qualified person; a positive test (induration) strongly suggests the patient has either been exposed to live mycobacteria or is actively infected (or had been vaccinated); no induration suggests the person tests negative for TB. This test can have false-positive results (especially in individuals vaccinated for TB with the BCG vaccine). False negative results can be caused by patients who are immunocompromised.""'Another test, IGRA (''interferon''-gamma release assays) can measure the immune response to ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''. Other quick tests are useful; chest X-rays can give evidence of lung infection while a sputum smear stained with certain dyes that are retained mainly (but not exclusively) by mycobacteria can show the presence of the bacterium. These tests, when examined by a doctor, are useful in establishing a presumptive diagnosis of either latent or active TB, and most doctors will initiate treatment based on their judgment of these tests. In addition, some of these tests are useful in the U.S. and elsewhere only in people who are not vaccinated with a TB vaccine (see below) but are less useful in vaccinated people. For some patients, culture studies still should be completed to determine the drug susceptibility of an infecting TB strain.''Other tests have been developed. For example, a ''PCR'' test (''polymerase chain reaction'"") to detect TB antigens and the LED-FM microscopic technique to identify TB organisms with microscopy may be used. Two other TB blood tests (also called interferon-gamma release assays or IGRAs) have been approved by the FDA and measure how strongly the body's immune system reacts to TB bacteria. IGRAs are recommended in testing patients who have been vaccinated against TB (see prevention section below).""'People with positive symptoms, positive blood tests, sputum smear, or culture positive are considered infected with TB and contagious (active TB).''Physicians diagnose and treat people with latent TB infections (LTBI) according to the following current CDC criteria:' 

Read Doctor's View
   No symptoms or physical findings suggestive of TB disease TST or IGRA result is usually positive Chest radiograph is typically normal If done, respiratory specimens are smear and culture negative Cannot spread TB bacteria to others Should consider treatment for LTBI to prevent TB disease (strongly advised by the CDC)"
What is the treatment for tuberculosis?,"'The treatment for TB depends on the type of TB infection and drug sensitivity of the mycobacteria. For latent TB, three anti-TB drugs are used in four different recommended schedules. The drugs are ''isoniazid'' (INH), rifampin (RIF; ''Rifadin''), and ''rifapentine'' (RPT; ''Priftin'"") and the CDC's four recommended schedules are below and are chosen by the treating doctor based on the patients overall health and type of TB the patient was likely exposed to.""'First-line drugs used to treat active TB are INH, RIF, ''ethambutol'' (EMB; ''Myambutol''), and ''pyrazinamide''. The CDC offers a guide for the basic treatment schedules for active TB (drug-susceptible TB organisms) as follows:'""The most current treatment guidelines need to be reviewed and correlated to the patient's specific condition and circumstances before any treatment is started.""'Treatment of drug-resistant (or antibiotic-resistant) and multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis TB can be difficult. These TB patients may require second-line drugs. Patients with these infections are recommended by the CDC to involve infectious-disease specialists as there are multiple approaches that involve other anti-TB drugs and variable treatment schedules that can be used. In addition, there are new drugs and treatment schedules being developed and approved by the FDA. The infectious-disease consultant may be aware of these newest treatments that may benefit specific patients. For example, bedaquiline (Sirturo) has been approved for treatment of MDR TB, and research with an antimicrobial drug, ''moxifloxacin'', suggests it may help in treatment protocols.''Some side effects of treatment may include the following:''Patients are urged to see their doctor if any side effects occur.''In some patients, the lung destruction may be severe and the only treatment left may be surgical resection of the diseased lung tissue.''Medications are needed for TB treatment. Home remedies will not treat TB but at best may help reduce symptoms. Home remedies may include milk, pineapple, Indian gooseberry, bananas, and many others. Patients should discuss these remedies with their doctors before use.'   Loss of appetite Nausea and/or vomiting Jaundice Paresthesia Bruise formation, bleeding Vision changes"
What types of doctors treat TB?,"""Although the patient's primary care doctor can oversee and coordinate treatment, other specialists like infectious disease, pulmonary medicine, internal medicine, critical care, and public health physicians can also be involved in the treatment."" "
What are complications of tuberculosis?,"'Although some people may develop no complications, others range from mild to severe complications, including death. Some of the more severe complications include lung function damage, bone pain (spine, ribs, and joints), meningitis, kidney and/or liver malfunction, cardiac tamponade, and visual disturbances.' "
What is the prognosis of tuberculosis?,"'For most people who live in areas where diagnosis and treatment is available, the prognosis of TB is good if they complete the treatment protocols. The recurrence rate of TB is low (0%-14%) and some may be due to reinfection. Drug-resistant tuberculosis is more difficult to treat, and the prognosis is not as good. The same poor prognosis occurs for those patients who are immunocompromised (for example, HIV-positive individuals), elderly, and in patients with previous infection and treatment for TB.' "
How can people prevent tuberculosis?,"'A vaccine against TB is commercially available; it is termed BCG, or Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine. However, the vaccine is not recommended for use in the U.S. because of the low risk for TB infections. Also, the vaccine is highly variable in its ability to prevent adult pulmonary disease. Another problem is that the vaccine may interfere with the interpretation of the tuberculin skin test. Despite this, a number of countries still use it to reduce childhood infections and miliary disease. Consequently, the CDC makes this recommendation: ""The BCG vaccine should be considered only for very select persons who meet specific criteria and in consultation with a TB expert.""''Currently, people who have active TB are suggested to be treated using isolation techniques along with anti-TB drugs to prevent spread according to the CDC. The CDC suggests that patients with probable active TB be isolated in a private room with negative pressure (air exhausted to outside or through a high-efficiency particulate air filter). Further, staff taking care of them must wear high-efficiency disposable masks sufficient to filter out any airborne mycobacteria. Continued isolation is suggested until sputum smears are negative for three consecutive determinations (usually after approximately two to four weeks of treatment). Sanatoriums (also spelled sanitorium or sanitarium) are where people with long-term illness, especially those with TB, used to be treated before good antibiotic therapy was available.''Researchers are attempting to produce an effective vaccine; there is a new study involving biobeads that contain several TB bacterial antigens and no live bacteria. The biobeads are being studied and may provide the first new vaccine against TB in 100 years.' "
What is teen depression?,"""Depression that rises to the level of meeting criteria for a diagnosis can be broadly understood as depression that is severe enough that it interferes with the person's ability to function in some way. It is quite common in every age group, affecting more than 16% of the population in the United States at some point in their lifetime. Depression occurs at a rate of about 2% during childhood and from 4%-7% during adolescence. This ""'mental illness'' is a leading cause of health impairment (morbidity) and death (mortality).''Depression is common during the teenage years, affecting about 20% of adolescents by the time they reach adulthood. Other statistics about teen depression include that more than 8% of adolescents suffer from depression that lasts a year or more.' "
What are causes and risk factors for depression in teenagers?,"'As with most mental health disorders, depression in teens does not have one single definitive cause. Rather, people with this illness tend to have a number of biological, psychological, and environmental risk factors that contribute to its development. Biologically, depression is associated with a reduced level of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain and with an imbalance of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. This emotional illness is associated with a decrease in the size of some areas of the brain, as well as increased activity in other areas of the brain. Females are more likely to get depression than males, but that is thought to be the result of, among other things, a combination of biological differences based on gender, as well as the differences in how girls and women are encouraged to interpret their environment and respond to it and how they express themselves compared to men and boys. There is thought to be at least a partially genetic contribution to the development of depression because children and adolescents with a depressed parent are up to four times more likely to develop the illness themselves. Teens who develop depression are also more prone to having other biological challenges, like low birth weight, trouble sleeping, and having a mother younger than 18 years old at the time of their birth.''Psychological risk factors for depression include low self-esteem, poor ''body image'', a tendency to be highly self-critical, and feeling helpless when dealing with negative events. Teen depression and other mood disorders are somewhat associated with the ''stress'' of body changes, including the fluctuating hormones of ''puberty'', as well as teen ambivalence toward increased independence, and with changes in their relationships with parents, peers, and others. Teenagers who suffer from conduct disorder, ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'' (''ADHD''), clinical ''anxiety'', or who have cognitive and learning problems, as well as trouble relating to others are at higher risk of also developing depression.''Depression may be a reaction to environmental stresses, including ''trauma'' like verbal, physical, or sexual abuse, the death of a loved one, school problems, or being the victim of ''bullying'' or peer pressure. Gay, bisexual, and transgender teens are at higher risk for depression, thought to be because of the bullying by peers and potential rejection by family members. Teens in military families have been found to be at risk for experiencing depression, as well.''The aforementioned environmental risk factors tend to specifically predispose individuals to depression. Other risk factors tend to predispose people to depression as well as putting them at risk for other problems. Such nonspecific risk factors for depression include poverty, exposure to violence, having an antisocial peer group or being socially isolated, abuse victimization, parental conflict, and family dissolution. Teens who have low physical activity, poor academic performance, or lose a relationship are at higher risk for depression. Research is increasingly showing that exposure to pollution or other environmental toxins is also thought to negatively influence mood.' "
"What are teen depression 
symptoms and signs?","'Clinical depression'', also called ''major depression'', is more than sadness that lasts for a day or two before feeling better. In true depressive illnesses, the symptoms last weeks, months, or sometimes years if no treatment is received. Depression often results in the sufferer being unable to perform daily activities, like getting out of bed or getting dressed, much less working, doing errands, or socializing.''According to the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders'' (''DSM-5''), which is the accepted resource for diagnosing mental disorders, general symptoms of a major depressive episode, regardless of age, include having a depressed or irritable mood for at least two weeks and having at least five of the following clinical signs and symptoms:''Depressed teenagers may also experience the classic symptoms but may exhibit other symptoms as well, including''Examples of risk-taking behaviors include driving recklessly or at excessive speed, socializing with strangers or otherwise without sufficient regard for their own safety, engaging in promiscuous or unprotected sex, or becoming intoxicated with ''alcohol'' or other ''drugs'"", especially in situations in which they are driving or may be in the presence of others who engage in risky behaviors. The use of alcohol or other drugs that occurs in depressed teens and other age groups is often thought to be the individual's attempt (risky and ultimately ineffective as it may be) to make themselves feel better (self-medicating).""'Parents of teens with depression often report noticing the following behavior changes in the adolescent:'  Feeling sad or blue Crying frequently Loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities Significant increase or decrease in appetite Significant weight loss, failing to gain weight appropriately, or gaining excessive weight Change in sleep pattern: inability to sleep or excessive sleeping Agitation, irritability, or anger Fatigue or loss of energy A tendency to isolate from friends and family Trouble concentrating Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt Thoughts of death or thoughts, plans, or attempts at completing suicide poor school performance, persistent boredom, frequent complaints of physical symptoms, such as headaches and stomachaches, engaging in self-harm that is not intended to cause death (for example, cutting or burning oneself), more risk-taking behaviors, and/or showing less concern for their own safety. Crying more often or more easily More irritability or hostility than usual Eating changes, changes in sleeping patterns, or weight change significantly or the teen fails to gain weight appropriately for their age Unexplained physical complaints (for example, headaches or abdominal pain) Spending more time alone, withdrawal from friends and family Becoming more ""clingy"" and more dependent on certain relationships (This is less common than social withdrawal.) Overly pessimistic or exhibits excessive guilt or feelings of worthlessness Expresses thoughts about hurting him or herself or exhibits reckless or other harmful behavior"
What are warning signs for teen suicide?,"'About 3,000 youth die by suicide each year in the United States, making it the third leading cause of death in youth ages 10-24. Latino and African-American teenage girls are thought to attempt suicide more often than their age peers who are male or of other ethnic backgrounds. Native-American teens tend to complete suicide nearly twice as often as the national average, and gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender teens complete suicide four times more than their heterosexual age peers.''10 Warning signs for teen suicide can include the following:' A sudden change in behavior Lack of motivation Social withdrawal/isolation A change in eating patterns Preoccupation with death or dying Giving away valued personal possessions Symptom or signs of depression Increased moodiness Hopelessness What appears to be a sudden improvement in mood (due to resolving to die by suicide)"
How do health care professionals diagnose depression in teens?,"""Many providers of health care may help make the diagnosis of clinical depression in teens, including licensed mental health therapists, pediatricians or other primary care providers, specialists whom you see for a medical condition, emergency physicians, psychiatrists, psychiatric physician's assistants, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, nurse practitioners, and social workers. Since the symptoms of depression can mimic those of other mental health disorders and depression can co-occur with other mental health disorders, the professional will ask about many other emotional problems to make that distinction.""'One of these professionals described above also will likely conduct or refer for an extensive medical interview and physical examination as part of establishing the diagnosis. Depression may be associated with a number of other medical conditions or can be a side effect of various medications. For this reason, routine laboratory tests are often performed during the initial evaluation to rule out other causes of symptoms. Occasionally, an X-ray, CT or ''MRI'' scan, or other imaging study may be needed. As part of this examination, the sufferer may be asked a series of questions from a standardized questionnaire or self-test to help assess the risk of depression and suicide.' "
What is the treatment for teen depression?,"'If the symptoms indicate that a teen is suffering from clinical depression, the health care provider will likely strongly recommend treatment. Treatment may include addressing any medical conditions that cause or worsen depression. For example, an individual who is found to have low levels of ''thyroid hormone'' might receive hormone replacement with levothyroxine (''Synthroid''). Other components of treatment may be supportive therapy, such as changes in lifestyle and behavior, psychotherapy, and complementary therapies. Treatment may include medication for moderate to severe depression. If symptoms are severe enough to warrant treatment with medication, symptoms tend to improve faster and for longer when medication treatment is combined with psychotherapy.''Most practitioners will continue treatment of major depression for at least six months to a year after symptoms have stabilized. Treatment for teens with depression can have a significantly positive effect on how well the adolescent functions with peers, family, and at school. Without treatment, symptoms tend to last much longer and may never get better. In fact, they may get worse. With treatment, chances of recovery are improved.''Psychotherapy (""talk therapy"") is a form of mental health counseling that involves working with a trained therapist to figure out ways to solve problems and cope with depression. It can be a powerful intervention, even producing positive biochemical changes in the brain. In addition to individual psychotherapy, group therapies have been found to be beneficial forms of treatment based on the normal developmental tendencies for adolescents to value their peer relationships. Two major approaches are commonly used to treat teen depression: interpersonal therapy and ''cognitive behavioral therapy''. In general, these therapies take weeks to months to complete. Each has a goal of alleviating the symptoms. More intense psychotherapy may be needed for longer when treating very severe depression or for depression with other psychiatric symptoms.''Interpersonal therapy (IPT)'': This form of psychotherapy helps to alleviate depressive symptoms and helps the sufferer develop more effective skills for coping with social and interpersonal relationships. IPT employs two strategies to achieve these goals:''Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)'': This type of psychotherapy has been found to be effective as part of treatment for even severe adolescent depression. This approach helps to alleviate depression and reduce the likelihood it will come back by helping the teen change his or her way of thinking about certain issues. In CBT, the therapist uses three techniques to accomplish these goals.''The major types of ''antidepressant'' medications prescribed for adults are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the ''tricyclic antidepressants'"" (TCAs), and the atypical antidepressants. TCAs are sometimes prescribed in adults in severe cases of depression or when SSRI medications don't work but have been determined not to be largely effective in treating teen depression. The ""'monoamine oxidase inhibitors'' (''MAOIs'') have fallen out of favor as antidepressants, particularly in adolescents, because of the negative interactions this group of medications can have with numerous foods and medications.''SSRI medications affect levels of serotonin in the brain. For many prescribing doctors, these medications are the first choice because of the high level of effectiveness and general safety of this group of medicines. Examples of these medications are listed here. The generic name is first, with the brand name in parentheses.''Only fluoxetine (Prozac) and escitalopram (Lexapro) are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of teen depression. Any other medications used to treat this illness in teens are therefore considered to be being used ""off label.""''Although FDA approved for use in teens with just ''bipolar disorder'' in the case of lurasidone (''Latuda'') and ''schizophrenia'' as well as ''bipolar disorder'' rather than for the treatment of depression in the case of other atypical neuroleptic medications like ''aripiprazole'' (''Abilify''), ''risperidone'' (''Risperdal''), ''olanzapine'' (''Zyprexa''), paliperidone (Invega), and ''quetiapine'' (''Seroquel''), these medications are also sometimes prescribed in addition to an antidepressant in adolescents with severe depression who fail to improve after receiving trials of different antidepressants. They may also be prescribed in addition to, or instead of, an antidepressant in teens who suffer from ''bipolar disorder''.''Non-neuroleptic mood-stabilizer medications are also sometimes used with an antidepressant to treat teens with unipolar depression who do not improve after receiving trials of different antidepressants. These medications might also be considered in addition to or instead of an antidepressant in adolescents who suffer from bipolar disorder. Examples of non-neuroleptic mood stabilizers that are used for this purpose include ''divalproex'' sodium (''Depakote''), ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol''), and ''lamotrigine'' (''Lamictal''). Of the non-neuroleptic mood stabilizers, Lamictal seems to be unique in its ability to also treat unipolar depression effectively by itself as well as in addition to an antidepressant. It is only used in people older than 16 years of age or older due to rare but potentially serious side effects.''Atypical antidepressant medications work differently than the commonly used SSRIs. The following medications might be prescribed when SSRIs have not worked: ''bupropion'' (''Wellbutrin''), ''venlafaxine'' (''Effexor''), ''duloxetine'' (''Cymbalta''), ''desvenlafaxine'' (''Pristiq''), or levomilnacipran (Fetzima).''About one-half of teens who take antidepressant medications get better. It may take anywhere from one to six weeks of taking medication at its effective dose to start feeling better. The prescribing mental health professional (for example, psychiatrist or other physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) will likely assess the depressed teen that is receiving the medication soon after it is started to see if the medication is being well tolerated and if symptoms have begun to improve. If not, the doctor may adjust the dose of the medication or prescribe a different one.''After symptoms begin to improve, the prescribing doctor will likely encourage the depressed teen to continue taking the medication for six months to a year since stopping the medication too soon may cause symptoms to return or to get worse. Some people need to take the medication for longer periods of time to keep the depression from returning. Stopping abruptly may cause the depression to return or for serious withdrawal effects to occur, depending on the medication that is being taken.''The side effects of antidepressant medications vary considerably from drug to drug and from person to person.''Several nonprescription herbal and ''dietary supplements'' are used by some people to treat depression. Little is known about the safety, effectiveness, or appropriate dosage of these remedies, although they are taken by thousands of people around the world.'  The first is education about the nature of depression. The therapist will emphasize that depression is a common illness and that most people can expect to get better with treatment. The second strategy is defining problems (such as abnormal grief or interpersonal conflicts). After the problems are defined, the therapist is able to help set realistic goals for solving these problems and work with the depressed teen using various treatment techniques to reach these goals. Didactic component: This phase helps to set up positive expectations for therapy and promote the youth's cooperation with the treatment process. Cognitive component: This aspect of CBT helps to identify the thoughts and assumptions and ways of thinking that influence the teen's behaviors, particularly those that may predispose the sufferer to being depressed. Behavioral component: This employs behavior-modification techniques to teach the teenager more effective strategies for dealing with problems. Fluoxetine (Prozac) Sertraline (Zoloft) Paroxetine (Paxil) Fluvoxamine (Luvox) Citalopram (Celexa) Escitalopram (Lexapro) Vortioxetine (Trintellix) Vilazodone (Viibryd) Common side effects include dry mouth, sexual dysfunction, nausea, tremor, insomnia, blurred vision, constipation, and dizziness. In very rare cases, some people of all ages have been thought to have become acutely more depressed once on the medication, even attempting or completing suicide or homicide. Children and teenagers are thought to be particularly vulnerable to this rare possibility. However, when considering this risk, it is important to also consider the risk of the potential serious outcomes that can result from untreated depression. A few of the best-known alternative remedies continue to be studied scientifically to see how well they work, but to date, there is little evidence that herbal remedies effectively treat moderate to severe clinical depression. Medical professionals usually are hesitant to recommend herbs or dietary supplements, particularly in teens, because they are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as prescription drugs are, to ensure their purity, quality, and safety."
What are complications of teen depression?,"'Teen depression is a risk factor for developing a number of other mental health symptoms and disorders. Teens with depression are more likely to engage in self-mutilation. That the number of teens who engage in that behavior is increasing is thought to be partially due to its being promoted by trends in music and media, including social media that features self-mutilating behaviors. Adolescents with depression are also at risk of having poor school performance, early ''pregnancy'', and engaging in alcohol and other ''drug abuse''. As adults, people who suffered from depression during adolescence are at risk for job disruptions, as well as family and other social upheaval during adulthood.' "
What is the prognosis of teen depression?,"'Depression can be quite chronic, in that 85% of people who have one episode of the illness will have another one within 15 years of the first episode. A bit over 50% of teens who are part of research studies on depression treatment significantly improve. About 12% will relapse in the first year, and about 60% of teens who suffer from clinical depression will suffer with a recurrence of it during adulthood. Clinical depression is the leading cause of disability in the United States in people over 5 years of age.''Adolescent depression is associated with a number of potentially negative outcomes, including problems at school, work, in their relationships, and with drugs. Certainly the worst potential outcome of depression, suicide is the third leading cause of death in teens.' "
Is it possible to prevent teen depression?,"'Attempts at ''prevention'"" of teen depression tends to address both specific and nonspecific risk factors, strengthen protective factors, and use an approach that is appropriate for the teen's developmental level. Such programs often use cognitive behavioral and/or interpersonal approaches, as well as family based prevention strategies because research shows that these interventions are the most helpful to teens' well-being.""""The inverse of most risk factors, protective factors for teen depression include having the involvement of supportive adults, strong family and peer relationships, healthy coping skills, and skills in emotion regulation. Children and adolescents of a depressed parent tend to be more resilient when the teen is more able to focus on age-appropriate tasks in their lives and on their relationships, as well as being able to understand their parents' illness. For depressed parents, their children seem to be more protected from developing the illness when the parent is able to demonstrate a commitment to ""'parenting'' and to relationships. Youth of depressed parents have also been found to benefit from being part of a support group that uses cognitive therapy as the management approach.' "
What can family members and friends do to help a depressed teen?,"""Family members and friends are advised to seek and encourage the depressed teen to receive mental health evaluation and treatment. Family members may consult with the teen's primary care doctor or seek mental health services by contacting one of the resources identified below. Friends of the depression sufferer sometimes think that they would be betraying their friend's confidence by notifying the depressed teen's parents, teachers, school counselor, or other school personnel about their friend's troubles. The potential risk of their friend's sadness worsening and leading to their becoming ""'suicidal'' or homicidal far outweighs the risk of the depressed teen feeling betrayed.''Once the depressed youth is in treatment, family members can help encourage good mental health by gently encouraging him or her to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Examples of that include encouraging the teen to drink plenty of water, maintain a healthy ''diet'', get adequate sleep, participate in regular ''exercise'', and engage in appropriate ''stress''-management activities. Friends can encourage the depressed peer to remain socially active rather than becoming isolated. Both family and friends can be helpful to the depressed teen by discouraging their loved one from using alcohol or other drugs or otherwise engaging in risky behaviors.' "

What drugs are abused by teenagers?,"'Virtually every drug that is abused by adults is also abused by adolescents. In addition to ''alcohol'', common categories of drugs of abuse include the following:'   Tobacco products (for example, cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco) Cannabinoids (for example, marijuana, hashish), sometimes called ""pot, weed, Mary Jane, or herb"" and is smoked in a ""joint,"" ""blunt,"" ""bong,"" ""backwood,"" or pipe Cold medications (for example, chlorpheniramine and pseudoephedrine [Sudafed], diphenhydramine [Benadryl] Inhalants (for example, gasoline, ammonia), the use of which is often referred to as ""huffing"" Depressants (for example, barbiturates, benzodiazepines), sometimes called ""reds, yellows, yellow jackets, downers or roofies"" Stimulants (for example, amphetamines, cocaine, methamphetamine), sometimes called ""bennies, black beauties, speed, uppers, blow, crack, rock, toot, crank, crystal, or skippy"" Narcotics (for example, morphine, heroin, codeine, oxycodone [Oxycontin], hydrocodone/acetaminophen [Vicodin], sometimes called cody, schoolboy, dope, Tango and Cash, or monkey"" Hallucinogens (for example LSD, ""mushrooms""), sometimes called ""acid, yellow sunshines, buttons, or shrooms"" Dissociative anesthetics (for example, phencyclidine/PCP, ketamine), sometimes called ""lovely, boat, Love Boat, angel dust, K, vitamin K, or cat"" and whose use is often referred to as ""getting wet"" Club drugs (for example, Ecstasy), sometimes called ""X"" Others (for example, anabolic steroids), sometimes called ""juice or roids"""
What are some adolescent drug use statistics?," Tobacco Smoking among teens in grades 8, 10 and 12 continued to decline in 2014 - a positive trend since most smokers begin their habit in adolescence—according to the latest survey results from the nationwide Monitoring the Future study. Based on annual surveys of 40,000 to 50,000 students in about 400 secondary schools, the researchers found that the percentage of students saying that they smoked at all in the prior 30 days fell for the three grades combined. The use of alcohol by teens has dropped dramatically over roughly the past two decades—particularly among the youngest teens—and continues to drop in 2014. The 30-day prevalence of alcohol use declined significantly in all three grades in 2014. The 12th-grade decline is statistically significant as is the decline for the three grades combined. All three grades are now at the lowest point that they have been at least since the mid-1990s, and likely longer. Among 8th graders, most of whom are 13 or 14 years old, the proportion who have ever taken ""more than just a few sips"" of alcohol by 8th grade has fallen by half since the 1990s. Prevalence of recent binge drinking (having five or more drinks in a row at least once in the past two weeks) dropped significantly in 2014 to under 20 percent of high school seniors. As with 30-day prevalence, all grades are at their lowest points since at least the mid-1990s. The two-week prevalence rates for binge drinking are now at 12 percent in the three grades combined - down from a peak level of 22 percent. Disapproval of binge drinking continues a gradual increase in the upper grades. Perceived availability for alcohol continues longer-term declines, which are sharpest in the lower grades. The index of any illicit drug use tends to be driven by marijuana, which is by far the most prevalent of the many illicitly used drugs. In 2014, the proportions of students indicating any use of an illicit drug in the prior 12 months declined slightly in the 12th grade, but remained unchanged from the prior year in the eighth and tenth grades. The percentages indicating any use in their lifetime are 20.3 percent, 37.4 percent and 49.1 percent. In other words, half of America's high school seniors have tried an illicit drug by the time they graduate and four in 10 have used it in just the past year. ""But it should also be noted that fully half of today's seniors have not tried an illicit drug by the end of high school,"" said Lloyd Johnston, the principal investigator of the study. In general, the use of marijuana among teens has been drifting higher in recent years following a decade or more of fairly steady decline. In 2014, use among the three grades declined slightly. Annual prevalence (the percent using once or more in the prior 12 months) declined from 12.7 percent to 11.7 percent among 8th graders 29.8 percent to 27.3 percent among 10th graders and from 36.4 percent to 35.1 percent among 12th graders. ""The belief that regular marijuana use harms the user, however, continues to fall among youth, so changes in this belief do not seem to explain the change in use this year, as it has done over most of the life of the study,"" Johnston said. From 2013 to 2014, the percent of students seeing great risk from being a regular marijuana user has fallen among 8th graders from 61 percent to 58.9 percent, among 10th graders from 46.5 percent to 45.4 percent, and among 12th graders from 39.5 percent to 36.1 percent."
What are the dangerous effects of drug use in teens?,"'Here are just a few of the many dangerous effects of drug use in adolescents:' Drugs of any kind decreases teens' ability to pay attention. The younger a person is when they begin using drugs the more likely they are to develop a substance-abuse problem and the more likely they are to relapse into drug abuse when trying to quit. Juveniles who use drugs are more likely to have unprotected sex, sex with a stranger, as well as to engage in sexual activity at all. This, in turn, puts them at risk for pregnancy, rape commission or victimization, and for sexually transmitted diseases. Substance use can cause or mask other emotional problems, like anxiety, depression, mood swings, or hallucinations (for example, hearing or seeing things). Either of those illnesses can result in death by suicide or homicide. Anabolic steroids have been associated with impotence in boys and men, clitoral enlargement in girls and women, as well as baldness, stunted growth, heart attacks, strokes, liver disease, cancer, acne and infections, including HIV/AIDS in both sexes. Depending on how the body takes in and processes each kind of drug, substances of abuse can affect virtually every one of the body's systems. Examples of this include permanent brain damage associated with inhalants, heart attack or stroke from stimulants, halted breathing from sedatives. Any of these problems can result in death."
How can parents prevent drug use?,"""Clear communication by parents about the negative physical, emotional, and functional effects of drugs, as well as about their expectations regarding drug use have been found to significantly decrease substance abuse in teens. Adequate parental supervision has also been found to be a deterrent to drug use in youth. Specifically, parents knowing how, where, and with whom adolescents socialize, as well as limiting their children's access to substances that can be abused have been associated with less teenage drug use. Limiting the amount of alcohol, cleaning solutions (inhalants), prescription, and ""'over-the-counter'' medications that are kept in the home to amounts that can be closely monitored and accounted for has also been found to decrease substance abuse by teens.''Family focused abuse-''prevention'' programs have produced reductions in adolescent drug abuse. Among ethnic minorities in the United States (for example African Americans, Hispanic, Native and Asian Americans), those who strongly identify with their communities and cultures have been found to be less likely to experience risk factors for using drugs compared to their peers who are less connected to their communities and cultures. Therefore, incorporation of a cultural component to drug-abuse prevention programs may enhance the effectiveness of those programs. Moreover, teens 15 to 16 years old who use religion to cope with ''stress'' tend to use drugs significantly less often than their peers who do not use religion to cope.''Alcohol and other drug use has been found to occur most often between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., immediately after school and prior to parents coming home from work. Teen participation in extracurricular activities has therefore been revealed as an important measure in preventing substance abuse in this age group.' "
What are the symptoms and warning signs of drug abuse?,"'Ways to recognize that a person is intoxicated or ""high"" on a drug depends on the substance with which he or she is intoxicated and include the following:''The physical symptoms of withdrawal from these drugs are often nearly the opposite of the effects of intoxication.'  Tobacco products: frequent smell of tobacco, irritability, discolored fingertips, lips or teeth, cigarette butts at curbside Cannabinoids: reddened whites of eyes, sleepiness, excessive hunger, lack of motivation, excessive happiness, paranoia Cold medications: sleepiness, rapid or slowed heart rate Inhalants: runny nose, smell of gasoline or other solvent, confusion or irritability Depressants: sleepiness, lowered inhibitions, poor coordination, slowed heart rate or blood pressure, dizziness, coma, death in overdose Stimulants: rapid heart rate or blood pressure, irritability, excessive happiness, less need for sleep, paranoia, seizures Narcotics: less experiencing of pain, excessive happiness, sleepiness, slowed or stopped breathing, coma, death in overdose Hallucinogens: trouble sleeping, blurred perceptions, paranoia Dissociative anesthetics: higher blood pressure and heart rate, memory loss, nausea and vomiting, irritability, aggressiveness Club drugs (for example, Ecstasy): feverish teen that does not sweat, finding multiple lollipops or other hard candies, the teen seeming to love everyone and/or have an excessively happy mood (euphoria) Others (for example, anabolic steroids): increased irritability or aggressiveness, rapid increase in muscle definition, thinning or loss of head hair, marked increase in acne over a short period of time, finding needles"
What is drug abuse?,"'As defined by the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', drug dependence is a negative pattern of using a substance that leads to a number of problems, which may include needing more of a drug to get intoxicated (tolerance), difficulties that occur when the effects of the drug wear off (withdrawal), using more of a substance or for longer time than intended, and other life problems because of their use of a drug or drugs.''Five stages of drug use have been identified. The first stage is described as access to drugs but no use thereof. In that stage, minimizing the risk factors that make a teenager more vulnerable to using drugs are an issue. The second stage of drug use ranges from experimentation or occasional use to regular weekly use of substances. The third stage is characterized by youth progressing to further increasing the frequency of using one or more drugs on a regular basis. This stage may also include the teenager either buying, stealing, or drug dealing to get drugs. In the fourth stage, adolescents have established regular usage, have become preoccupied with getting intoxicated (""high""), and have developed problems in their social, educational, vocational, or family life as a result of using the substance. The final and most serious fifth stage of drug use is defined by the youth only feeling ""normal"" when they are using. During this stage, risk-taking behaviors like stealing, drug dealing, engaging in physical fights, unprotected sex, or driving while intoxicated increase and they become most vulnerable to having ''suicidal'' or homicidal thoughts.' "
What are the causes and risk factors of teen drug use?,"'Family risk factors for teenagers engaging in drug abuse include low parent supervision or communication, family conflicts, inconsistent or severe parental discipline, and family history of alcohol or drug abuse. Individual risk factors include any history of physical or sexual victimization, learning or emotional problems, difficulty managing impulses, emotional instability, thrill-seeking behaviors, and perceiving the risk of using drugs to be low.' "
What are the symptoms of drug abuse in teens?,"'Some of the most common symptoms of drug abuse in teenagers include lying, making excuses, breaking curfew, staying in their room, becoming verbally or physically abusive toward others, having items in their possession that are connected to drug use (paraphernalia), the smell of drugs (for example, solvent smell of inhalants, marijuana smell) on them, mood swings, sleepless nights, stealing, and changes in friends. Examples of paraphernalia include matches, rolling papers, and pipes for drugs that are smoked, multiple pill bottles for substances that are in pill form, mirrors for drugs that are snorted, and needles, syringes, and items that can be used as tourniquets for drugs that are injected. In addition to those more behavioral symptoms, loved ones can look for the physical symptoms of drug intoxication and withdrawal. Given the complexity of those symptoms and how much they depend upon the specific drug being abused, loves ones are advised to have their family member evaluated medically and/or psychiatrically if substance abuse is suspected for any reason.' "
What is the treatment of drug intoxication?,"'Supporting the substance-abuse sufferer medically is the approach to managing most drug intoxications, since many substances of abuse can affect bodily functions (for example, heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate). In addition to close medical monitoring, doctors usually have the individual assessed psychiatrically, since drugs are associated with everything from impaired judgment to severe aggression, assaultive behavior, and even ''suicidal'' and homicidal behaviors. Some medications are available to specifically counteract the effects of drugs. For example, naltrexone is used to counteract the effects of opioid intoxication. Blood pressure medications may be administered to patients who are suffering from ''high blood pressure'' associated with stimulant intoxication and with withdrawal from depressants. Fluids are often administered to those who have become dehydrated, and cooling blankets are given to those whose temperatures have become dangerously high, as may occur with Ecstasy.' "
What are treatments for drug addiction?,"'There are few medications that are considered effective in treating ''drug addiction''. Those are currently limited to the treatment of ''alcoholism'', as well as opioid, and ''nicotine'' addiction. Please read the ''Alcohol and Teens'' article for information about the medications that manage alcohol addiction. Effective medication treatment for other addictions is primarily limited to address addiction to opiates and nicotine. ''Methadone'', levo-alpha acetyl methadol (LAAM), and buprenorphine hydrochloride are non-sedating, non-intoxicating opiates that treat opiate addiction by preventing symptoms of withdrawal from heroin and other opiates. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opiates and is therefore useful in both treatment of overdose of opiates and in longer-term treatment. Nicotine addiction is often medically addressed by medications that replace nicotine in the form of patches, gum, or nasal spray. ''Bupropion'', which was originally found to be an effective ''antidepressant'"", has been found to decrease patients' cravings for nicotine.""'The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) recommends that treatment of substance abuse: be readily available when the addicted person is ready to enroll; be tailored to the complex, multiple and changing needs (for example medical, ''mental health'', social, legal, and family) of each individual; and consider the use of medication treatment when appropriate and include random drug testing. There are numerous individual treatments for chemical dependency in teens. Relapse prevention uses methods for recognizing and amending problem behaviors, as well as providing support to the adolescent in his or her community. Individualized drug counseling specifically emphasizes short-term behavioral goals in an attempt to help the individual reduce or stop the use of drugs altogether, as well as maintaining their safety. Some such programs include drug testing. Twelve-step programs like Narcotics Anonymous are individualized drug-counseling methods. Motivational enhancement therapy encourages the teen to increase their desire to participate in therapy. Stimulus control refers to a treatment method that teaches the person to stay away from situations that are associated with substance abuse and to replace those situations with activities that are contrary to using drugs. Urge control is an approach to changing patterns that lead to drug use. Social control involves family members and other significant others of the addict in treatment.''Family interventions for drug addiction that tend to be effective for teens include multidimensional family therapy (MDFT), group therapy, and multifamily educational intervention (MFE). MDFT has been found to be quite effective. Longer-term residential treatment of three to five months that addresses peer relationships, educational problems, and family issues is often used in treating substance abuse in teens.''For youths in the first stage of drug use, where they have not yet used drugs, preventative measures are used. Therefore, limiting access to drugs, addressing any risk factors of the youth or family, as well as optimal parental supervision and expression regarding expectations is often recommended. The approach to those who have experimented with drugs is not minimized by drug treatment counselors, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental-health professionals, since infrequent use can progress to the more serious stages of use if not addressed. Therefore, professionals recommend that the youth be thoroughly educated about the effects and risks of drugs, receive fair but firm limits on the use of substances, and that the user be referred for brief counseling, a self-help group, and/or family support group. Teens that have progressed to the more advanced stages of drug addiction are typically treated intensively, often including inpatient drug treatment (drug rehab) and involves a combination of the medication, individual, and familial interventions already described above.'

What drugs are abused by teenagers?,"'Virtually every drug that is abused by adults is also abused by adolescents. In addition to ''alcohol'', common categories of drugs of abuse include the following:'   Tobacco products (for example, cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco) Cannabinoids (for example, marijuana, hashish), sometimes called ""pot, weed, Mary Jane, or herb"" and is smoked in a ""joint,"" ""blunt,"" ""bong,"" ""backwood,"" or pipe Cold medications (for example, chlorpheniramine and pseudoephedrine [Sudafed], diphenhydramine [Benadryl] Inhalants (for example, gasoline, ammonia), the use of which is often referred to as ""huffing"" Depressants (for example, barbiturates, benzodiazepines), sometimes called ""reds, yellows, yellow jackets, downers or roofies"" Stimulants (for example, amphetamines, cocaine, methamphetamine), sometimes called ""bennies, black beauties, speed, uppers, blow, crack, rock, toot, crank, crystal, or skippy"" Narcotics (for example, morphine, heroin, codeine, oxycodone [Oxycontin], hydrocodone/acetaminophen [Vicodin], sometimes called cody, schoolboy, dope, Tango and Cash, or monkey"" Hallucinogens (for example LSD, ""mushrooms""), sometimes called ""acid, yellow sunshines, buttons, or shrooms"" Dissociative anesthetics (for example, phencyclidine/PCP, ketamine), sometimes called ""lovely, boat, Love Boat, angel dust, K, vitamin K, or cat"" and whose use is often referred to as ""getting wet"" Club drugs (for example, Ecstasy), sometimes called ""X"" Others (for example, anabolic steroids), sometimes called ""juice or roids"""
What are some adolescent drug use statistics?," Tobacco Smoking among teens in grades 8, 10 and 12 continued to decline in 2014 - a positive trend since most smokers begin their habit in adolescence—according to the latest survey results from the nationwide Monitoring the Future study. Based on annual surveys of 40,000 to 50,000 students in about 400 secondary schools, the researchers found that the percentage of students saying that they smoked at all in the prior 30 days fell for the three grades combined. The use of alcohol by teens has dropped dramatically over roughly the past two decades—particularly among the youngest teens—and continues to drop in 2014. The 30-day prevalence of alcohol use declined significantly in all three grades in 2014. The 12th-grade decline is statistically significant as is the decline for the three grades combined. All three grades are now at the lowest point that they have been at least since the mid-1990s, and likely longer. Among 8th graders, most of whom are 13 or 14 years old, the proportion who have ever taken ""more than just a few sips"" of alcohol by 8th grade has fallen by half since the 1990s. Prevalence of recent binge drinking (having five or more drinks in a row at least once in the past two weeks) dropped significantly in 2014 to under 20 percent of high school seniors. As with 30-day prevalence, all grades are at their lowest points since at least the mid-1990s. The two-week prevalence rates for binge drinking are now at 12 percent in the three grades combined - down from a peak level of 22 percent. Disapproval of binge drinking continues a gradual increase in the upper grades. Perceived availability for alcohol continues longer-term declines, which are sharpest in the lower grades. The index of any illicit drug use tends to be driven by marijuana, which is by far the most prevalent of the many illicitly used drugs. In 2014, the proportions of students indicating any use of an illicit drug in the prior 12 months declined slightly in the 12th grade, but remained unchanged from the prior year in the eighth and tenth grades. The percentages indicating any use in their lifetime are 20.3 percent, 37.4 percent and 49.1 percent. In other words, half of America's high school seniors have tried an illicit drug by the time they graduate and four in 10 have used it in just the past year. ""But it should also be noted that fully half of today's seniors have not tried an illicit drug by the end of high school,"" said Lloyd Johnston, the principal investigator of the study. In general, the use of marijuana among teens has been drifting higher in recent years following a decade or more of fairly steady decline. In 2014, use among the three grades declined slightly. Annual prevalence (the percent using once or more in the prior 12 months) declined from 12.7 percent to 11.7 percent among 8th graders 29.8 percent to 27.3 percent among 10th graders and from 36.4 percent to 35.1 percent among 12th graders. ""The belief that regular marijuana use harms the user, however, continues to fall among youth, so changes in this belief do not seem to explain the change in use this year, as it has done over most of the life of the study,"" Johnston said. From 2013 to 2014, the percent of students seeing great risk from being a regular marijuana user has fallen among 8th graders from 61 percent to 58.9 percent, among 10th graders from 46.5 percent to 45.4 percent, and among 12th graders from 39.5 percent to 36.1 percent."
What are the dangerous effects of drug use in teens?,"'Here are just a few of the many dangerous effects of drug use in adolescents:' Drugs of any kind decreases teens' ability to pay attention. The younger a person is when they begin using drugs the more likely they are to develop a substance-abuse problem and the more likely they are to relapse into drug abuse when trying to quit. Juveniles who use drugs are more likely to have unprotected sex, sex with a stranger, as well as to engage in sexual activity at all. This, in turn, puts them at risk for pregnancy, rape commission or victimization, and for sexually transmitted diseases. Substance use can cause or mask other emotional problems, like anxiety, depression, mood swings, or hallucinations (for example, hearing or seeing things). Either of those illnesses can result in death by suicide or homicide. Anabolic steroids have been associated with impotence in boys and men, clitoral enlargement in girls and women, as well as baldness, stunted growth, heart attacks, strokes, liver disease, cancer, acne and infections, including HIV/AIDS in both sexes. Depending on how the body takes in and processes each kind of drug, substances of abuse can affect virtually every one of the body's systems. Examples of this include permanent brain damage associated with inhalants, heart attack or stroke from stimulants, halted breathing from sedatives. Any of these problems can result in death."
How can parents prevent drug use?,"""Clear communication by parents about the negative physical, emotional, and functional effects of drugs, as well as about their expectations regarding drug use have been found to significantly decrease substance abuse in teens. Adequate parental supervision has also been found to be a deterrent to drug use in youth. Specifically, parents knowing how, where, and with whom adolescents socialize, as well as limiting their children's access to substances that can be abused have been associated with less teenage drug use. Limiting the amount of alcohol, cleaning solutions (inhalants), prescription, and ""'over-the-counter'' medications that are kept in the home to amounts that can be closely monitored and accounted for has also been found to decrease substance abuse by teens.''Family focused abuse-''prevention'' programs have produced reductions in adolescent drug abuse. Among ethnic minorities in the United States (for example African Americans, Hispanic, Native and Asian Americans), those who strongly identify with their communities and cultures have been found to be less likely to experience risk factors for using drugs compared to their peers who are less connected to their communities and cultures. Therefore, incorporation of a cultural component to drug-abuse prevention programs may enhance the effectiveness of those programs. Moreover, teens 15 to 16 years old who use religion to cope with ''stress'' tend to use drugs significantly less often than their peers who do not use religion to cope.''Alcohol and other drug use has been found to occur most often between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., immediately after school and prior to parents coming home from work. Teen participation in extracurricular activities has therefore been revealed as an important measure in preventing substance abuse in this age group.' "
What are the symptoms and warning signs of drug abuse?,"'Ways to recognize that a person is intoxicated or ""high"" on a drug depends on the substance with which he or she is intoxicated and include the following:''The physical symptoms of withdrawal from these drugs are often nearly the opposite of the effects of intoxication.'  Tobacco products: frequent smell of tobacco, irritability, discolored fingertips, lips or teeth, cigarette butts at curbside Cannabinoids: reddened whites of eyes, sleepiness, excessive hunger, lack of motivation, excessive happiness, paranoia Cold medications: sleepiness, rapid or slowed heart rate Inhalants: runny nose, smell of gasoline or other solvent, confusion or irritability Depressants: sleepiness, lowered inhibitions, poor coordination, slowed heart rate or blood pressure, dizziness, coma, death in overdose Stimulants: rapid heart rate or blood pressure, irritability, excessive happiness, less need for sleep, paranoia, seizures Narcotics: less experiencing of pain, excessive happiness, sleepiness, slowed or stopped breathing, coma, death in overdose Hallucinogens: trouble sleeping, blurred perceptions, paranoia Dissociative anesthetics: higher blood pressure and heart rate, memory loss, nausea and vomiting, irritability, aggressiveness Club drugs (for example, Ecstasy): feverish teen that does not sweat, finding multiple lollipops or other hard candies, the teen seeming to love everyone and/or have an excessively happy mood (euphoria) Others (for example, anabolic steroids): increased irritability or aggressiveness, rapid increase in muscle definition, thinning or loss of head hair, marked increase in acne over a short period of time, finding needles"
What is drug abuse?,"'As defined by the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'', drug dependence is a negative pattern of using a substance that leads to a number of problems, which may include needing more of a drug to get intoxicated (tolerance), difficulties that occur when the effects of the drug wear off (withdrawal), using more of a substance or for longer time than intended, and other life problems because of their use of a drug or drugs.''Five stages of drug use have been identified. The first stage is described as access to drugs but no use thereof. In that stage, minimizing the risk factors that make a teenager more vulnerable to using drugs are an issue. The second stage of drug use ranges from experimentation or occasional use to regular weekly use of substances. The third stage is characterized by youth progressing to further increasing the frequency of using one or more drugs on a regular basis. This stage may also include the teenager either buying, stealing, or drug dealing to get drugs. In the fourth stage, adolescents have established regular usage, have become preoccupied with getting intoxicated (""high""), and have developed problems in their social, educational, vocational, or family life as a result of using the substance. The final and most serious fifth stage of drug use is defined by the youth only feeling ""normal"" when they are using. During this stage, risk-taking behaviors like stealing, drug dealing, engaging in physical fights, unprotected sex, or driving while intoxicated increase and they become most vulnerable to having ''suicidal'' or homicidal thoughts.' "
What are the causes and risk factors of teen drug use?,"'Family risk factors for teenagers engaging in drug abuse include low parent supervision or communication, family conflicts, inconsistent or severe parental discipline, and family history of alcohol or drug abuse. Individual risk factors include any history of physical or sexual victimization, learning or emotional problems, difficulty managing impulses, emotional instability, thrill-seeking behaviors, and perceiving the risk of using drugs to be low.' "
What are the symptoms of drug abuse in teens?,"'Some of the most common symptoms of drug abuse in teenagers include lying, making excuses, breaking curfew, staying in their room, becoming verbally or physically abusive toward others, having items in their possession that are connected to drug use (paraphernalia), the smell of drugs (for example, solvent smell of inhalants, marijuana smell) on them, mood swings, sleepless nights, stealing, and changes in friends. Examples of paraphernalia include matches, rolling papers, and pipes for drugs that are smoked, multiple pill bottles for substances that are in pill form, mirrors for drugs that are snorted, and needles, syringes, and items that can be used as tourniquets for drugs that are injected. In addition to those more behavioral symptoms, loved ones can look for the physical symptoms of drug intoxication and withdrawal. Given the complexity of those symptoms and how much they depend upon the specific drug being abused, loves ones are advised to have their family member evaluated medically and/or psychiatrically if substance abuse is suspected for any reason.' "
What is the treatment of drug intoxication?,"'Supporting the substance-abuse sufferer medically is the approach to managing most drug intoxications, since many substances of abuse can affect bodily functions (for example, heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate). In addition to close medical monitoring, doctors usually have the individual assessed psychiatrically, since drugs are associated with everything from impaired judgment to severe aggression, assaultive behavior, and even ''suicidal'' and homicidal behaviors. Some medications are available to specifically counteract the effects of drugs. For example, naltrexone is used to counteract the effects of opioid intoxication. Blood pressure medications may be administered to patients who are suffering from ''high blood pressure'' associated with stimulant intoxication and with withdrawal from depressants. Fluids are often administered to those who have become dehydrated, and cooling blankets are given to those whose temperatures have become dangerously high, as may occur with Ecstasy.' "
What are treatments for drug addiction?,"'There are few medications that are considered effective in treating ''drug addiction''. Those are currently limited to the treatment of ''alcoholism'', as well as opioid, and ''nicotine'' addiction. Please read the ''Alcohol and Teens'' article for information about the medications that manage alcohol addiction. Effective medication treatment for other addictions is primarily limited to address addiction to opiates and nicotine. ''Methadone'', levo-alpha acetyl methadol (LAAM), and buprenorphine hydrochloride are non-sedating, non-intoxicating opiates that treat opiate addiction by preventing symptoms of withdrawal from heroin and other opiates. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opiates and is therefore useful in both treatment of overdose of opiates and in longer-term treatment. Nicotine addiction is often medically addressed by medications that replace nicotine in the form of patches, gum, or nasal spray. ''Bupropion'', which was originally found to be an effective ''antidepressant'"", has been found to decrease patients' cravings for nicotine.""'The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) recommends that treatment of substance abuse: be readily available when the addicted person is ready to enroll; be tailored to the complex, multiple and changing needs (for example medical, ''mental health'', social, legal, and family) of each individual; and consider the use of medication treatment when appropriate and include random drug testing. There are numerous individual treatments for chemical dependency in teens. Relapse prevention uses methods for recognizing and amending problem behaviors, as well as providing support to the adolescent in his or her community. Individualized drug counseling specifically emphasizes short-term behavioral goals in an attempt to help the individual reduce or stop the use of drugs altogether, as well as maintaining their safety. Some such programs include drug testing. Twelve-step programs like Narcotics Anonymous are individualized drug-counseling methods. Motivational enhancement therapy encourages the teen to increase their desire to participate in therapy. Stimulus control refers to a treatment method that teaches the person to stay away from situations that are associated with substance abuse and to replace those situations with activities that are contrary to using drugs. Urge control is an approach to changing patterns that lead to drug use. Social control involves family members and other significant others of the addict in treatment.''Family interventions for drug addiction that tend to be effective for teens include multidimensional family therapy (MDFT), group therapy, and multifamily educational intervention (MFE). MDFT has been found to be quite effective. Longer-term residential treatment of three to five months that addresses peer relationships, educational problems, and family issues is often used in treating substance abuse in teens.''For youths in the first stage of drug use, where they have not yet used drugs, preventative measures are used.

What's involved with teen disease prevention?,"'The teen years are a time of growth that involves experimentation and risk taking. For some teens, the social pressures of trying to fit in can be too much. These years can be even more troubling for teens when confronted with teenage ''pregnancy'', ''substance abuse'', violence, ''bullying'', delinquency, ''suicide'', ''depression'', unintentional injuries, and school failure. Parents often walk a tightrope between allowing their teenager to gain some independence and helping them to deal with their feelings during this difficult and challenging time in their lives.''Teenagers recognize that they are developmentally between childhood and adulthood. Emerging cognitive abilities and social experiences lead teens to question adult values and experiment with health risk behaviors. Some behaviors threaten current health, while other behaviors may have long-term health consequences. The changes in cognitive abilities offer an opportunity to help teenagers develop attitudes and lifestyles that can enhance their health and well-being. Teen ''disease prevention'' includes maintaining a healthy ''diet'', exercising regularly, preventing injuries, and screening annually for potential health conditions that could adversely affect teenage health.' "
What can teens expect during health checkups?,"'Annual checkups for teenagers provide an opportunity for the following:'  Promote healthy lifestyle choices that include nutrition and exercise. Many teens maintain a diet high in saturated fats and low in complex carbohydrates (fruits and vegetables) and milk and other dairy products. Adolescents should have at least 60 minutes of vigorous exercise per day. Unfortunately, many teens experience less that this goal per week while utilizing social media (Internet, text messaging, Facebook, etc.) for greater than three hours per day. Screen sexually active teenagers for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV. Many young people engage in sexual risk behaviors that can result in unintended health outcomes. For example, among U.S. high school students surveyed in 2013:47% had ever had sexual intercourse;34% had sexual intercourse during the previous three months; and, of these;41% did not use a condom the last time they had sex;15% had had sex with four or more people during their life;Health care providers have tested only 22% of sexually experienced students for HIV. 47% had ever had sexual intercourse; 34% had sexual intercourse during the previous three months; and, of these;41% did not use a condom the last time they had sex; 41% did not use a condom the last time they had sex; 15% had had sex with four or more people during their life; Health care providers have tested only 22% of sexually experienced students for HIV. Sexual risk behaviors place adolescents at risk for HIV infection, other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and unintended pregnancy:Nearly 10,000 young people (aged 13-24) received a diagnosis of HIV infection in the United States in 2013.Young gay and bisexual men (aged 13-24) accounted for an estimated 19% (8,800) of all new HIV infections in the United States, 72% of new HIV infections among youth in 2010.Nearly half of the 20 million new STDs each year were among young people, between the ages of 15 to 24.Approximately 273,000 babies were born to teen girls aged 15-19 years in 2013. Nearly 10,000 young people (aged 13-24) received a diagnosis of HIV infection in the United States in 2013. Young gay and bisexual men (aged 13-24) accounted for an estimated 19% (8,800) of all new HIV infections in the United States, 72% of new HIV infections among youth in 2010. Nearly half of the 20 million new STDs each year were among young people, between the ages of 15 to 24. Approximately 273,000 babies were born to teen girls aged 15-19 years in 2013. Assess whether a teen has an eating disorder such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia, or obesity. Doctors reach this assessment by determining weight and stature and asking about body image and dieting patterns. The obesity epidemic is real -- 12.5 million children between 2 to 19 years of age are overweight. This value has tripled since 1980. The flip side of this issue is the prevalence of eating disorders. More than one-half of teenage girls and nearly one-third of teenage boys use unhealthy weight control behaviors such as skipping meals, fasting, smoking cigarettes, vomiting, and taking laxatives. Discover if teenager is experiencing emotional problems such as depression or anxiety. Several studies have determined that 3%-5% of teens will experience a bout of clinical depression. Warning signs include (1) low interest in pleasurable activities, (2) change in appetite --  weight loss or weight gain, (3) insomnia or hypersomnia, (4) fatigue/loss of energy, (5) decrease in concentration skills that may be reflected academically, and (6) thoughts of death, suicide ideation, and/or attempts. Ask teenager if they have a history of emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, as well as bullying. Bullying is one of the biggest challenges that teens are facing. Unfortunately, many teens deal with bullying while their parents and teachers are unaware on the specific nature and severity of the problem in their school. Data from 2010 indicate that approximately 160,000 students miss school each day as a result of bullying or fear of being bullied. School districts and administrators have often adopted a ""zero tolerance"" approach to bullying. However, progressively more frequent cases of ""cyber bullying"" using social media are replacing the overt verbal threat and/or physical assault that is the more traditional experience in past years. Research indicates that in 2010 approximately 2.7 million students were the victims of approximately 2.1 million bullying contemporaries. That means that about 282,000 high school students experience bullying each month. Unfortunately, those who experience bullying may react in different ways to repeated bullying. Some who have been the victims of bullying respond by adopting the policy of ""the best defense is a strong offense"" and become a bully themselves. Other teens see no alternative but suicide. Nationally, suicide is the third cause of death for adolescents (behind automobile accidents and homicide). Discuss the health risks of smoking, alcohol abuse, and other drug abuses (including anabolic steroids). Approximately 20% (6 million) of teens smoke cigarettes with the huge majority aware of the immediate and long-term associated health risks. A 2013 CDC study indicates that 35% of questioned teens admitted to drinking alcohol (beer, wine, and spirits) in the month prior. More concerning perhaps is that 21% of those questioned admitted binge drinking (five or more drinks in rapid succession) in the month prior to the study. Ask teens about learning or school problems to determine if they need special counseling. Screen teenagers who have a history of absences or declining school performance for dyslexia, learning disabilities, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Identify signs and symptoms of disease, illness, and health conditions. Most studies indicate that the majority of teens suffer from sleep deprivation. Specialists recommend the average teen get eight hours of quality sleep per night. Many teen sleep patterns are disrupted by chronic and excessive caffeine (sodas, coffee, ""energy drinks""). Couple this behavior with difficulty turning off electronic lifelines (cell phones and computers) and it is easy to understand that the first two hours of the high school day are often filled with ""zoned out"" pupils. Screen for high blood pressure. Unlike adults who commonly have ""primary"" or ""essential"" hypertension, children and teens suffering from high blood pressure need a vigorous evaluation in an attempt to locate a primary cause. Test teenager's cholesterol level if their parents have a serum cholesterol level greater than 180 mg/dl. A 2010 study indicated that 14% of normal weight teens and 43% of overweight teens have elevated cholesterol levels. Screen teenagers who have multiple risk factors for future cardiovascular disease (for example, smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, excessive consumption of dietary saturated fats and cholesterol) for total serum cholesterol level. Assess health risk factors for overweight teenagers to determine their risk for future cardiovascular disease."
What immunizations do teenagers need?,"'This is the immunization schedule as recommended by the federally convened Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC).''Most infants complete their immunization series against ''hepatitis B'' by their first birthday. If not completed, this should be accomplished by teens 11-12 years of age. Teens who are traveling to or living in countries with high or intermediate ''hepatitis A'' virus (HAV), live in communities with high rates of HAV, have chronic ''liver disease'', are injecting drug users, or are males who have sex with males should get the ''hepatitis A vaccine''. Complete immunization requires two vaccinations separated by a minimum of six months.''Meningococcal vaccine'': All teens 11-12 years of age should receive a vaccination to prevent meningococcal diseases (meningitis, general body ''sepsis'', etc., from the meningococcal bacteria). Medical professionals recommend two doses -- the first at 11-12 years of age and the second after 16 years of age. Of note, this has become a mandatory vaccination prior to entering college environment. There is also a vaccination against meningococcal B. This vaccine is against another bacteria similar to the first meningococcal bacteria described above but microscopically and immunologically unique. Health care professionals commonly administer this second vaccine at 18 years of age with a booster six months later.''Teens of both genders should be immunized against ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV''). ''HPV'' is the leading cause of cervical and ''penile cancer'' and ''genital warts''. If started before 15 years of age, the booster vaccine is given 6 months after the first. If started at or past 15 years of age, two booster ''vaccines'' are necessary -- at two months and six months following the initial vaccination. Health care providers recommend the annual vaccination against ''influenza'' for all teens.''People can find recommendations of special vaccine needs for foreign travel on the CDC web site.' Teens should receive a trivalent Tdap vaccine booster at the 11-12-year visit if not previously vaccinated within five years. With the exception of the Tdap booster at 11-12 years of age, routine boosters should be administered every 10 years. Teenagers should receive a second dose of MMR at 11-12 years of age, unless there is documentation of two vaccinations earlier during childhood. Medical professionals administer the first vaccination at 1 year of age. Pregnant teens should not receive the MMR vaccine. Teens, 11-12 years of age, who have not received their second Varivax vaccination as part of a routine childhood schedule and who do not have a reliable history of chickenpox should receive this booster vaccination. Health care providers administer the first dose at 1 year of age."

For example, among U.S. high school students surveyed in 2013:47% had ever had sexual intercourse;34% had sexual intercourse during the previous three months; and, of these;41% did not use a condom the last time they had sex;15% had had sex with four or more people during their life;Health care providers have tested only 22% of sexually experienced students for HIV. 47% had ever had sexual intercourse; 34% had sexual intercourse during the previous three months; and, of these;41% did not use a condom the last time they had sex; 41% did not use a condom the last time they had sex; 15% had had sex with four or more people during their life; Health care providers have tested only 22% of sexually experienced students for HIV. Sexual risk behaviors place adolescents at risk for HIV infection, other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and unintended pregnancy:Nearly 10,000 young people (aged 13-24) received a diagnosis of HIV infection in the United States in 2013.Young gay and bisexual men (aged 13-24) accounted for an estimated 19% (8,800) of all new HIV infections in the United States, 72% of new HIV infections among youth in 2010.Nearly half of the 20 million new STDs each year were among young people, between the ages of 15 to 24.Approximately 273,000 babies were born to teen girls aged 15-19 years in 2013. Nearly 10,000 young people (aged 13-24) received a diagnosis of HIV infection in the United States in 2013. Young gay and bisexual men (aged 13-24) accounted for an estimated 19% (8,800) of all new HIV infections in the United States, 72% of new HIV infections among youth in 2010. Nearly half of the 20 million new STDs each year were among young people, between the ages of 15 to 24. Approximately 273,000 babies were born to teen girls aged 15-19 years in 2013. Assess whether a teen has an eating disorder such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia, or obesity. Doctors reach this assessment by determining weight and stature and asking about body image and dieting patterns. The obesity epidemic is real -- 12.5 million children between 2 to 19 years of age are overweight. This value has tripled since 1980. The flip side of this issue is the prevalence of eating disorders. More than one-half of teenage girls and nearly one-third of teenage boys use unhealthy weight control behaviors such as skipping meals, fasting, smoking cigarettes, vomiting, and taking laxatives. Discover if teenager is experiencing emotional problems such as depression or anxiety. Several studies have determined that 3%-5% of teens will experience a bout of clinical depression. Warning signs include (1) low interest in pleasurable activities, (2) change in appetite --  weight loss or weight gain, (3) insomnia or hypersomnia, (4) fatigue/loss of energy, (5) decrease in concentration skills that may be reflected academically, and (6) thoughts of death, suicide ideation, and/or attempts. Ask teenager if they have a history of emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, as well as bullying. Bullying is one of the biggest challenges that teens are facing. Unfortunately, many teens deal with bullying while their parents and teachers are unaware on the specific nature and severity of the problem in their school. Data from 2010 indicate that approximately 160,000 students miss school each day as a result of bullying or fear of being bullied. School districts and administrators have often adopted a ""zero tolerance"" approach to bullying. However, progressively more frequent cases of ""cyber bullying"" using social media are replacing the overt verbal threat and/or physical assault that is the more traditional experience in past years. Research indicates that in 2010 approximately 2.7 million students were the victims of approximately 2.1 million bullying contemporaries. That means that about 282,000 high school students experience bullying each month. Unfortunately, those who experience bullying may react in different ways to repeated bullying. Some who have been the victims of bullying respond by adopting the policy of ""the best defense is a strong offense"" and become a bully themselves. Other teens see no alternative but suicide. Nationally, suicide is the third cause of death for adolescents (behind automobile accidents and homicide). Discuss the health risks of smoking, alcohol abuse, and other drug abuses (including anabolic steroids). Approximately 20% (6 million) of teens smoke cigarettes with the huge majority aware of the immediate and long-term associated health risks. A 2013 CDC study indicates that 35% of questioned teens admitted to drinking alcohol (beer, wine, and spirits) in the month prior. More concerning perhaps is that 21% of those questioned admitted binge drinking (five or more drinks in rapid succession) in the month prior to the study. Ask teens about learning or school problems to determine if they need special counseling. Screen teenagers who have a history of absences or declining school performance for dyslexia, learning disabilities, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Identify signs and symptoms of disease, illness, and health conditions. Most studies indicate that the majority of teens suffer from sleep deprivation. Specialists recommend the average teen get eight hours of quality sleep per night. Many teen sleep patterns are disrupted by chronic and excessive caffeine (sodas, coffee, ""energy drinks""). Couple this behavior with difficulty turning off electronic lifelines (cell phones and computers) and it is easy to understand that the first two hours of the high school day are often filled with ""zoned out"" pupils. Screen for high blood pressure. Unlike adults who commonly have ""primary"" or ""essential"" hypertension, children and teens suffering from high blood pressure need a vigorous evaluation in an attempt to locate a primary cause. Test teenager's cholesterol level if their parents have a serum cholesterol level greater than 180 mg/dl. A 2010 study indicated that 14% of normal weight teens and 43% of overweight teens have elevated cholesterol levels. Screen teenagers who have multiple risk factors for future cardiovascular disease (for example, smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, excessive consumption of dietary saturated fats and cholesterol) for total serum cholesterol level. Assess health risk factors for overweight teenagers to determine their risk for future cardiovascular disease."
What immunizations do teenagers need?,"'This is the immunization schedule as recommended by the federally convened Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC).''Most infants complete their immunization series against ''hepatitis B'' by their first birthday. If not completed, this should be accomplished by teens 11-12 years of age. Teens who are traveling to or living in countries with high or intermediate ''hepatitis A'' virus (HAV), live in communities with high rates of HAV, have chronic ''liver disease'', are injecting drug users, or are males who have sex with males should get the ''hepatitis A vaccine''. Complete immunization requires two vaccinations separated by a minimum of six months.''Meningococcal vaccine'': All teens 11-12 years of age should receive a vaccination to prevent meningococcal diseases (meningitis, general body ''sepsis'', etc., from the meningococcal bacteria). Medical professionals recommend two doses -- the first at 11-12 years of age and the second after 16 years of age. Of note, this has become a mandatory vaccination prior to entering college environment. There is also a vaccination against meningococcal B. This vaccine is against another bacteria similar to the first meningococcal bacteria described above but microscopically and immunologically unique. Health care professionals commonly administer this second vaccine at 18 years of age with a booster six months later.''Teens of both genders should be immunized against ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV''). ''HPV'' is the leading cause of cervical and ''penile cancer'' and ''genital warts''. If started before 15 years of age, the booster vaccine is given 6 months after the first. If started at or past 15 years of age, two booster ''vaccines'' are necessary -- at two months and six months following the initial vaccination. Health care providers recommend the annual vaccination against ''influenza'' for all teens.''People can find recommendations of special vaccine needs for foreign travel on the CDC web site.' Teens should receive a trivalent Tdap vaccine booster at the 11-12-year visit if not previously vaccinated within five years. With the exception of the Tdap booster at 11-12 years of age, routine boosters should be administered every 10 years. Teenagers should receive a second dose of MMR at 11-12 years of age, unless there is documentation of two vaccinations earlier during childhood. Medical professionals administer the first vaccination at 1 year of age. Pregnant teens should not receive the MMR vaccine. Teens, 11-12 years of age, who have not received their second Varivax vaccination as part of a routine childhood schedule and who do not have a reliable history of chickenpox should receive this booster vaccination. Health care providers administer the first dose at 1 year of age."
How much sleep do children need?,"'Just as with adults, the amount of ''sleep'' children need varies with both age and unique needs of the individual. Below are general guidelines for children of various ages. If your child is happy and thriving, but needs more or fewer hours of ''sleep'"" than indicated below - rest assured they will remain healthy. The National Sleep Foundation's 2015 Guidelines recommend the following for sleep in children and ""'teens''.'  1 to 4 weeks old: Neonates spend approximately 65% to 75% of their daily activity in a sleep state. Waking time is of short duration and it is rare for a child of this age to have a ""day-night"" cycle. Their day-night ""clock"" is not functional until 6 to 8 weeks of age. Mothers of newborns should use their infant's sleep pattern to sleep also. 1 to 4 months old: Infants at this early age require sleep 14 to 17 hours 
of sleep per day. Many begin to develop a day-night cycle during the early weeks of this period. 
At this age, many infants have the ability to sleep evening blocks of 5 to 6 hours without interruption; however most will wake for feedings or diaper changes during the night. 4 to 12 months old: Infants in this age range require 12 to 15 hours of sleep daily. Good news for parents 
- they begin to sleep for longer continuous periods at night. Also, early in this time period, many children benefit from multiple daytime naps, though there is significant variability between different infants.  1 to 3 years old: While specialists point out that most toddlers need about 12 to 14 hours of daily sleep, many may be forced to survive on less. Daycare and erratically spaced car trips necessary for the needs of older siblings often deny or disrupt continuous sleep patterns, most often naps. 3 to 6 years old: This age range commonly needs approximately 10 to 13 hours of sleep per day with younger individuals taking a nap after lunch. Any need for napping is generally absent by the time a child enters 1st grade. 7 to 12 years old: Younger children in this age range commonly require 
9 to 11 hours of sleep each night; pre-teens often receive 9 to 10 hours (though some may require more). 12 to 18 years old: Middle and high school student lifestyle requirements (school, after school activities, dinner and finally homework) often reduce the sleep duration from the recommended 8 to 
10 hours to 6 to 8 hours. The various social network computer websites coupled with cell phone text communication 
and television viewing also may cut into a teenager's sleep time."
Can a lack of sleep impact a child's behavior?,"'The symptoms of a lack of sleep are often obvious to watchful parents. Some of these tell-tale signs include: ' recurrently falling asleep in the car (excluding young infants); requiring extreme stimulation and repetitive reminders to get up in the morning;  behavioral abnormalities such as excessive emotionalism, aggression, and crankiness; and  an older child's (over 8 years of age) recurrent need for an afternoon nap."
What is sleep hygiene?,"'A common definition of sleep hygiene is'' '' ""all behavioral and environmental factors that precede sleep and may interfere with sleep."" Daytime sleepiness and trouble sleeping may be a reflection of poor sleep hygiene. Detailed specifics are listed below. General areas to consider include: ' Personal habits: Establish consistent routines around bedtimes and awakening times  Sleep environment: The bedroom should be a slightly cooler temperature 
(between 60 F to 67 F or 15.5 C to 19.4 C), and eliminate any distracting noise in the bedroom Getting ready for bed: Establish a calming pre-sleep ritual (for example, reading, not watching TV) and  Miscellaneous: Examples include limiting intake of foods/liquids/medications which may disrupt a restful sleep"
What are some common sleep disorders in children?,"""The University of Michigan's ""'Sleep Disorders'' program includes five issues that may be disruptive of good sleep practices. These include: ' Sleep deprivation: As noted in the previously, the amount of sleep generally required varies with age and genetic predisposition. Unfortunately many older children, especially teens, do not receive an appropriate amount of sound sleep. Night waking: All children after the first 7 to 8 months of life start to be more sensitive to internal and external stimuli. If an infant has not yet learned to calm himself and resettle back to sleep, the parents commonly are summoned to help the child return to sleep. This pattern may repeat itself several times each night. Separation anxiety: Children experience this emotion commonly at 5 months of age as well as during the toddler years. Such children become anxious and are unable to enter a comfortable sleep pattern unless parents are present.  Resistance to sleep/settling problems: This occurs when your child does not want to go to bed at a reasonable time. Stalling, temper tantrums, and other resistance patterns are common. Parental persistence generally will resolve this common issue. Parasomnias: Parasomnias are problems that disrupt sleep. Examples include night terrors, grinding of teeth, sleepwalking, etc."
Sleep Apnea symptoms in children,"'Sleep apnea'' is an extremely serious sleep pathology in which the child will struggle to breath and possibly stop ''breathing'"". This process most commonly is a consequence of an enlarged tonsil and adenoid tissues that obstruct the child's upper ""'airway'"". Parents of such children will report that it sounds as if their child is being choked during sleep. Complications of sleep apnea include reduced oxygen to the brain and strain of the right side of the heart. If you believe your child may have sleep apnea, you should discuss your concerns with your child's pediatrician. An evaluation by and ENT (ears-nose-throat) specialist is often indicated. It is helpful to either audio/video record such an episode prior to such an evaluation."" "
Parasomnia symptoms in children,"'Parasomnias are disruptive sleep related events. They include several infrequent events (''periodic limb movement disorder'', ''restless leg syndrome'') and more common events (''teeth grinding'', night terrors, and ''nightmares'', sleepwalking, and ''bedwetting''). Periodic limb movement disorder occurs while asleep and is characterized by repetitive leg and (occasionally) arm movement that persist throughout the night. The child or teenager does not complain of any discomfort or abnormal sensations. In contrast, ''restless leg syndrome'' occurs while awake and affected individuals often describe a sensation of their legs ""falling asleep.""''Nightmares occur during REM (dreaming period) sleep and thus are more common later in the night. The child acts scared but may be comforted by their parents. Such children will often be able to remember their dream. Simple parental reassurance and comforting is effective. In contrast, night terrors occur in non-''REM sleep'' and thus generally within the first 4 hours of sleep. The child may become very violent with crying out in a confused manner as well as thrashing of arms and legs. Routine comforting of the child is not helpful and the child will be confused and bewildered if awakened. Generally, the child will rapidly return to a ""normal"" sleep with no memory of the events in the morning.' "
Confusional arousal symptoms in children,"'Confusional arousals are a variant of night terrors in older infants and toddlers that occur during the first half of the nighttime sleep sequence. It is felt that the child is so deeply asleep and the normal waking pattern at the end of the sleep cycle is suppressed. ''The major distinguishing point of confusional arousals versus night terrors is that the former gradually build from moaning, to crying out, and may culminate in the child standing and yelling out apparent random words or phrases. ''Conversely, night terrors tend to have an acute onset with the very rapid development of thrashing and yelling (commonly for the parents or caregivers). Confusional arousal and night terrors share several key points important for the child:' Don't try to awaken the child. They are asleep and if awakened, will have difficult time falling back to sleep. Anything that upsets the normal sleep rhythms (illness, not sleeping in their own home, and disrupted naps) may trigger either pattern."
Night terror symptoms in children,"'Night terrors are somewhat rare events that have their highest frequency in children 4 to 12 years of age. They are commonly outgrown by adulthood, though some adults manifest the same brain ''EEG'' (""brain wave"") changes during sleepwalking. ''Night terrors differ from nightmares (see previously). Night terrors manifest themselves with the person bolting upright in bed, screaming and thrashing about and stare blankly at the concerned adult who has come to investigate. They tend to occur during the first third of the child\'s sleep cycle. Children characteristically do not ""calm down"" when their parent attempts to soothe what appears to be a fearful experience. EEG studies demonstrate that the child is not awake (i.e. he/she is asleep), and if awakened, has no knowledge or memory of the immediately preceding events. The duration of night terror episodes is short lived. Some authorities believe that night terrors may be a response to sleep deprivation, ''stress'', ''fever'', or ''fatigue''.' "
Narcolepsy symptoms in children,"'Narcolepsy'' is more common in adults than children. It has been defined as ""a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep. Narcolepsy is a chronic condition for which there is no cure."" Research has shown that narcolepsy is not a type of ''seizure'', ''fainting'' episode, or psychological illness. Symptoms of narcolepsy include:' Excessive daytime sleepiness: affected individuals have an uncontrollable need to sleep during the day; Sudden loss of muscle tone (Cataplexy): this may range from slurred speech to total collapse of all voluntary muscles. Emotional stimulation (often positive by nature, for example, laughter) may trigger such an attack; Sleep paralysis: Characterized by a temporary (1-2 minutes) period of the inability to speak or move when falling asleep or waking; Vivid or frightening hallucinations which occur most commonly during REM (dreaming) sleep."
Sleepwalking symptoms in children,"'The onset of sleepwalking (somnambulism) typically presents in prepubertal children most frequently at age 11 to 12, and occurs more often in boys than girls. The overall incidence of sleepwalking is approximately 18%. Like night terrors, the individual is difficult to arouse during the event and does not remember the experience. Sleepwalking most commonly occurs during the first third of the sleep cycle. Some sleepwalkers may also mumble during sleepwalking episodes and occasionally obscene words may be uttered. Medications are rarely necessary to manage sleepwalking episodes. Ensuring a safe environment (protection against falls or ''walking'' out of the house) and maintenance of good sleep habits (avoiding sleep deprivation) are important considerations to prevent sleepwalking.' "
Do teenagers have the same sleep requirements as younger children?,"'Most teens need about 8 to 10 hours of sleep per day. Some studies have indicated that they have a different internal ""sleep clock"" than those younger or older than them. Researchers have demonstrated that teens are truly ""night owls,"" and if left to their own devices, would spontaneously wake from a good night\'s sleep anywhere from 9:00 am to 10:00 am. High school teachers who have classes before this time period have empiric experience to second this observation. Younger children may need anywhere from 12-15 hours (infant: 2 naps plus nighttime long block) to 9-11 hours (middle school child). ' "
How can I teach my child or teenager healthy sleep habits and good sleep hygiene?,"'Primary to establishing good sleep habits is a realization that sleep is a normal and necessary function. However, just as with other normal and necessary functions (for example, eating, toilet training, etc.), a battle may develop between parents and their child in this area. ''All children older than 5 to 6 months of age need to master the ability to self-soothe and relax in order to successfully fall asleep. Depriving them of this skill by either feeding or rocking them to sleep, reading until the child falls asleep, or lying down with the child in order to facilitate falling asleep, is a recipe for frustration - both for the child and the parent. ''Tired children (of any age) intuitively know when they are tired and, if provided the proper environment, will easily and quickly fall asleep. ''When they awaken during the middle of the night they are capable of falling back to sleep without parental intervention. In this circumstance, both child and parents awake refreshed the next morning.' "
What are some ways I can help my child or teenager get a better night's sleep?,"'These ""do\'s"" are adapted from ""''Sleep Problems'': Your Child"" University of Michigan Health Care System and ""Healthy Sleep Tips"" from the National Sleep Foundation.'  Make bedtime a special time. Create special soothing and calming experiences with the opportunity for special ""talks"" or sharing experiences that foster comfort for both child and parent. Study your child so you can determine when he is ready to sleep. Once this is determined you can start the ""get ready for bed"" routine with enough time in advance so the child doesn't get a ""second wind"". Keep the bedtime routine consistent and simple. Mental and physical stimulation is counter productive. Dim lights starting about 10 – 15 minutes before going to sleep.  Bright lights act as a stimulant to the child's brain.   Keep the bedtime routine portable. For example, it can occur whether at home or outside of the home (for example, in a motel during vacation). Make sure your child is both mentally and physically tired at the end of the day. Children need between 30 to 60 minutes per day of vigorous playtime (depending on the age). Besides fostering good sleep habits, such a program will help maintain optimum weight gain. Establish a restful atmosphere. Keep the lights dim, limit noise and electronic devices. Teens should turn off computers/TV's and cell phones when retiring to bed. 
The bedroom temperature should be between 60 F and 67 F or 15.5 C to 19.4 C. Avoid afternoon naps in children over 6 years of age."
"What are some ""don'ts"" for getting my child or teen to sleep?","'These ""don\'ts"" are adapted from ""Sleep Problems: Your Child"" University of Michigan Health Care System.' Don't put your child to bed with a bottle of juice, milk or formula. Sugar in such drinks promotes tooth decay. Water is acceptable. Don't fill up the bed with toys. Limit the crib/bed to one to two ""special"" items. Too many items are over stimulating and the child will have a hard time not playing with them. Eliminate any object that might be a safety hazard. Don't threaten to send your child to bed as a punishment. Bedtime should be an enjoyable experience that will promote falling asleep in a timely fashion. Avoid caffeine before bed: Caffeinated drinks such as cola, chocolate, iced tea, 
energy drinks, etc. Limit TV in the afternoon and at night. TV stimulation may carry on longer than you suspect. Having a TV in a child's room may be counterproductive to getting your child or teen to sleep. A 2014 National Sleep Foundation study indicates that 72% of children 6 years old to 17 years old have at least one electronic device in their bedroom.  These children may get up to one hour less sleep per night as their peers without such devices in the bedroom."
How Should I Care for My Teeth and Gums?,'There are four basic steps to caring for teeth and gums:' Brushing Flossing Eating right Visiting the dentist
Tips for Brushing,"'Brush at least twice a day. If you can, brush after every meal. Brushingremoves plaque, a film of bacteria that clings to teeth. When bacteria in plaquecome into contact with food, they produce acids. These acids lead to ''cavities''.To brush:' Place a pea-sized dab of fluoride toothpaste on the head of the toothbrush.
(Use a soft toothbrush.) Place the toothbrush against the teeth at a 45-degree angle to the gum
line. Move the brush across the teeth using a small circular motion. Continue
with this motion cleaning one tooth at a time. Keep the tips of the bristles
against the gum line. Avoid pressing so hard that the bristles lie flat against
the teeth. (Only the tips of the toothbrush clean the teeth.) Let the bristles
reach into spaces between teeth. Brush across the top of the chewing surfaces of the teeth. Make sure the
bristles get into the groves and crevices. Use the same small circular motion to clean the backside of the upper and
lower teeth -- the side that faces the tongue. To clean the inside of the bottom front teeth, angle the head in an
up-and-down position toward the bottom inside of the mouth and move the
toothbrush in a small circle. For the inside of the top front teeth, angle the brush in an up-and-down
position with the tip of the head pointing towards the roof of the mouth. Move
the toothbrush in a small circle. Give your tongue a few gentle brush strokes, brushing from the back of your
tongue forward. Do not scrub. This helps remove bacteria and freshens your
breath. After brushing your teeth for two to three minutes, rinse your mouth with
water. Replace your toothbrush with a new one every 3 to 4 months."
Tips for Flossing,"'Floss once a day. Flossing gets rid of food and plaque between the teeth,where your toothbrush cannot reach. If plaque stays between teeth, it canharden into tartar, which must be removed by a dentist. To floss:' Remove about an 18-inch strip of floss from the dispenser. Wind the floss around the middle fingers of each hand, leaving a 1-inch
section open for flossing. Floss the top teeth first, then the bottom. Place the floss in your mouth and use your index fingers to push the floss
between the teeth. Be careful not to push too hard and injure the gums. Move the floss up and down against the tooth and up and around the gum
line. The floss should form a C-shape around the tooth as you floss. Floss between each tooth as well as behind the back teeth. Use a clean section of floss as needed and take up used floss by winding it
around the fingers."
Tips for Eating Right,"'Eat a variety of foods but eat fewer foods that contain sugars and starches.These foods produce the most acids in the mouth and the longer they stay in themouth, the more they can damage the teeth. Hard ""sucking candies"" areespecially harmful because they stay in the mouth a long time.'""Snacking on sugary foods can lead to tooth decay because most people don'tbrush after snacks. Starchy snack foods, like potato chips, stick to the teeth.Avoid snacking on:"" Candies, cookies, cakes and pie Sugary gum Crackers, breadsticks and chips Dried fruits and raisins"
Dental Check-Ups,"""Visit your dentist at least once every six months. To maintain healthy teethand gums, it's important to have regular check-ups and professional cleanings.You should also see your dentist if you have ""'pain'' in your teeth or mouth orbleeding, swollen gums.''You can also ask your dentist about ''dental sealants''. Sealant is a material used to coat the top, chewingsurfaces of the teeth. This coating protects the tooth from decay and usuallylasts a long time.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Reviewed by Brunilda Nazario, MD, on October 22, 2007''Portions of this page © ''The Cleveland Clinic 2000-2005' "
What is teeth grinding?,'Teeth grinding'' is a condition whereby one excessively grinds or clenches their ''teeth''. Typically grinding and clenching occurs mostly when sleeping but some individuals may grind and clench during the day also. ''Teeth'' grinding is also referred to as ''bruxism''.' 
What are the dangers of teeth grinding?,"'Teeth grinding can create numerous problems such as''Children that grind due to a ''breathing'' ''airway'' problem can have developmental issues.' local muscular pain, headaches, loss of tooth structure, gum recession, loose teeth, shortening of teeth, tooth sensitivity, cracked and broken teeth, damage to the bone structure of the jaw joint with temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ syndrome), and even facial changes."
What causes teeth grinding?,"'The exact cause of teeth grinding is not totally understood and there are numerous different theories. However, there is a link to breathing airway issues, such as' sleep apnea, jaw posture positions, tooth position, dental work that has changed jaw position or tooth positions, abnormal bite, trauma, repetitive strain, lifestyle activities, as well as emotional and developmental issues."
Who is at risk for teeth grinding?,'Anyone that has teeth can potentially grind their teeth. Anyone from small toddlers to the elderly and everyone in between can grind their teeth.'  
What are symptoms and signs of teeth grinding?,"'Symptoms of teeth grinding include' headaches, muscle pain, jaw tenderness, shortened teeth, gum recession, notches or indentations on the gum line of teeth, tooth sensitivity, cracked and broken teeth, and temporomandibular joint syndrome."
What is the treatment for teeth grinding?,"'A ''sleep'' study is recommended to rule out an airway issue because grinding occurs mostly at night while sleeping.' If a poor airway is a contributing factor then treatment can be offered for the airway first and sometimes the teeth grinding will cease. Every situation of teeth grinding is managed uniquely, but often a mouth guard fitted by a dentist is helpful. The mouth guard is worn when sleeping to protect the teeth from grinding. Dietary changes, postural modifications, emotional therapy, medications, injections, tooth adjustments and dental work, orthodontics, surgery, are various treatments used."
What is the prognosis for teeth grinding?," The prognosis for teeth grinding can very good, especially if the underlying cause can be determined. If it cannot, then at least wearing a properly fitting mouth guard can protect the teeth from further damage and often lessen the effects on the bone, muscle, and tissues. Babies and toddlers grinding their teeth should always have an airway evaluation."
Teeth whitening introduction,"'Will all types of bleaching procedures, the degree of whiteness will vary from individual to individual depending on the condition of the teeth, nature of the stain, the concentration of the bleach and the duration of time and bleaching system used.' Age and pregnancy issues. Bleaching is not recommended in children under the age of 16. This is because the pulp chamber, or nerve of the tooth, is enlarged until this age. Teeth whitening under this condition could irritate the pulp or cause it to become sensitive. Teeth whitening is also not recommended in pregnant or lactating women. Sensitive teeth and allergies to products. Individuals with sensitive teeth and gums, receding gums and/or defective restorations should consult with their dentist prior to using a tooth whitening system. Anyone allergic to peroxide (the whitening agent) should not use a bleaching product. Gum disease, worn enamel, cavities, and exposed roots. Individuals with gum disease or teeth with worn enamel are generally discouraged from undergoing a tooth whitening procedure. Cavities need to be treated before undergoing any whitening procedure. This is because the whitening solutions penetrate into any existing decay and the inner areas of the tooth, which can cause sensitivity. Also, whitening procedures will not work on exposed tooth roots because roots do not have an enamel layer. Fillings, crowns and other restorations. Tooth-colored fillings and resin composite materials used in dental restorations (crowns, veneers, bonding, bridges) do not whiten. Therefore, using a whitening agent on teeth that do and do not contain restorations will results in uneven whitening-in this case, making the teeth without restorations appear lighter than those with restorations. Any whitening procedure should be done prior to the placement of composite fillings, bonding, veneers, crowns, dentures, or porcelain restorations in order to best match the degree of whitening to your new tooth color. A minimum of 2 weeks following a whitening procedure should be allowed before crowns, bondings, or veneers are completed. This will allow enough time for the enamel to remineralize and optimize the bonding strength. Tooth-colored fillings will need to be replaced after the bleaching process is complete. Individuals with numerous restorations that would result in uneven whitening may be better off considering bonding, veneers or crowns rather than a tooth whitening system. Ask your dentist what strategy may be best for you. Unrealistic expectations. Individuals who expect their teeth to be a new ""blinding white"" may be disappointed with their results. Smokers need to be aware that their results will be limited unless they refrain from continued smoking, particularly during the bleaching process. A healthy guide as to a reasonable degree of whiteness to achieve with a whitening process that would give a natural appearance to a person's teeth is a slightly whiter color than the whites of your eyes. Darkly stained teeth. Yellow-ish teeth respond well to bleaching, brownish-colored teeth respond less well, and grayish-hue or purple-stained teeth may not respond well to bleaching at all. Blue-gray staining caused by tetracycline is more difficult to lighten and may require up to 6 months of home treatments or several in-office appointments to successfully lighten. Teeth that have dark stains may be better candidates for another lightening option, such as veneers , bonding , or crowns . Your dentist can discuss the options best suited for your situation."

The strips are applied twice daily for 30 minutes for 14 days. Initial results are seen in a few days and final results are sustained for about 4 months. The retail cost for this product ranges from $10 to $55 for a 14-day treatment.'""Both of these products contain peroxide in a concentration that is much lower than the peroxide-based products that are used in your dentist's office. Although some teeth lightening will be achieved, the degree of whitening is much lower than results achieved with in-office or dentist-supervised whitening systems. Additionally, use of ""'over-the-counter products'' do not benefit from the close supervision of your dentist ? to determine what whitening process may be best for you, to check on the progress of the teeth whitening process and look for signs of gum irritation. On the positive, the over-the-counter gels and strips are considerably less expense (ranging from $10 to about $55) than the top-of-the line in-office whitening procedures, which can cost nearly $800.' Whitening gels are clear, peroxide-based gels applied with a small brush directly to the surface of your teeth. Instructions generally call for twice a day application for 14 days.

Tray-Based Tooth Whitening Procedures,"""Bleaching procedures performed in the dentist's office involve a few different or additional steps ? namely, that a protective gel or guard is positioned over the gums before the bleaching agent is applied, the bleaching agent is applied directly to the teeth, and the whitening process is hastened with the use of heat, a special light, or laser light that is directed at the chemically coated teeth. There are other differences that are addressed in the next question."" "
At-Home vs At-the-Dentist Dental Bleaching,"""If you have made up your mind to assume the risks associated with over-the-counter, tray-based bleaching kits, here's some sound advice:"" Strength of bleaching agent. For starters, over-the-counter home use products and dentist-supervised at-home products usually contain a lower strength-bleaching agent (from 10% carbamide peroxide-which is equivalent to about 3 percent hydrogen peroxide ? up to 22% carbamide peroxide). In-office, professionally applied tooth whitening products contain hydrogen peroxide in concentrations ranging from 15 to 43 percent. Mouthpiece trays. With dentist-supervised at-home bleaching products, your dentist will take an impression of your teeth and make a mouthpiece tray that is customized to exactly fit your teeth. This customization allows for maximum contact between the whitening gel, which is applied to the mouthpiece tray, and the teeth. A custom-made tray also minimizing the gel's contact with gum tissue. Over-the-counter whitening products do contain a mouthpiece tray, but the ""one-size-fits-all"" approach means that the fit will not be exact. Ill-fitting trays can irritate the gum and soft tissue by allowing more bleaching gel to seep onto these tissues. With in-office procedures, the bleaching agent is applied directly to the teeth. Additional protective measures. In the office setting, your dentist will apply either a gel to the gum tissue or use a rubber shield (which slides over the teeth) prior to treatment to protect your gums and oral cavity from the effects of the bleaching. Over-the-counter products don't provide these extra protective measures. Speed of the bleaching process. Dentist-supervised at-home bleaching and over-the-counter bleaching products typically need to be applied every day for 1 or 2 hours or every overnight for up to 4 weeks. In-office bleaching provides the quickest and most effective way to whiten teeth. With in-office bleaching, the whitening product is applied directly to the teeth. These products can be used in combination with heat, a special light, and/or a laser. The light and/or heat accelerate the whitening process. Results are seen in only 1, 30- to 60-minute treatment. To achieve dramatic results, however, several appointments are usually needed. With laser-enhanced bleaching, however, dramatic results can be seen after the first treatment. Costs. Over-the-counter bleaching systems are the least expensive option, with costs ranging from $20 to about $150. Depending on where you live and the extent of the procedure, dentist-supervised home bleaching systems range in cost from approximately $150 to $300 per upper or lower set of teeth, or $300 to $600 for the whole mouth. In-office bleaching procedures range in cost from $200 to $500 per arch, or $500 to $1,000 for the whole mouth. Supervised versus unsupervised process. Dentist-supervised at-home bleaching and in-office treatments offer additional benefits compared with over-the-counter procedures. First, your dentist can perform an oral examination and consider your complete medical history, which can be helpful in determining how your teeth became discolored and if bleaching is an appropriate course of treatment based on your type of stains and number, type, and location of restorations. Your dentist can then better match the type of stain with the best treatment, if appropriate, to lighten those stains. With dentist-supervised bleaching procedures, your dentist will likely want to see you a couple of times to ensure you are following directions, to make sure the customized tray is fitting properly, to inspect your gums for signs of irritation, and to generally check on how the teeth whitening process is proceeding. With over-the-counter bleaching products, you are on your own. Try to select a kit that allows some customization of the mouthpiece. Some kits come with a mouthpiece that can be molded to some degree. These are better than others that come with a standard stock mouthpiece. Try to gain the opinion of others who may have already tried the kit you are considering. If at any time you experience a prolonged change in the color of your gums or an increased tooth sensitivity to hot or cold foods and beverages, stop wearing the mouthpiece and see your dentist immediately."
Risks Associated With Teeth Whitening,"'If you do experience sensitivity, you can reduce or eliminate it by:' Wearing the tray for a shorter period of time (for example, two 30-minute sessions versus two 60-minute sessions) Stop whitening your teeth for two to three days to allow your teeth to adjust to the whitening process Ask your dentist or pharmacist for a high fluoride-containing product, which can help remineralize your teeth. Apply the fluoride product to the tray and wear for 4 minutes prior to and following the whitening agent. Brush your teeth with a toothpaste made for sensitive teeth. These toothpastes contain potassium nitrate, which helps soothe your teeth's nerve endings."
Products Safety,"""It should be noted that not all manufacturers seek the ADA's Seal of Acceptance. This is a voluntary program that requires considerable expense and time on the part of a manufacturer. Just because a product does not have the ADA Seal of Acceptance does not necessarily mean that the product is not safe and effective. You can be assured, however, that products that do carry the seal have meet the ADA's standards for safety and effectiveness when used as directed.""'Teeth whiteners are not ''drugs'' and therefore are not regulated by the FDA.' "
Follow-Up Care,"'Tips for maintaining your newly whitened teeth include:' Avoiding the consumption of or exposure to products that stain your teeth (see first question in this document on what causes teeth to become stained). If you do choose to consume beverages that stain, consider using a straw so that the liquid bypasses your front teeth. Brush or rinse immediately after consuming stain-causing beverages or foods. Follow good oral hygiene practices. Brush your teeth at least twice daily and floss at least once daily to remove plaque. Use a whitening toothpaste (once or twice a week only) to remove surface stains and prevent yellowing. Use a regular toothpaste the rest of the time. Consider touch-up treatments. Depending on the whitening method used, you may need a tough-up every 6 months or after a year or two. If you smoke or drink lots of stain-causing beverages, you may need a touch up more often."
Frequently Asked Questions,"'Do teeth whiteners damage tooth enamel?'""Studies of whitening products using 10% carbamide peroxide showed little to no effect on the hardness or mineral content of a tooth's enamel surface.""'Do teeth whiteners damage existing dental restorations?''Over 10 years of clinical use of whitening products containing 10% carbamide peroxide have not shown any damage to existing fillings. The issue is not ""damage"" to existing restorations; rather, keep in mind that existing restorations such as tooth-colored fillings, crowns, bonding, veneers, and bridges do not lighten. This means that any preexisting dental work may need to be replaced to match the new tooth shade achieved in the natural teeth, should a bleaching process proceed.'""Do teeth whiteners damage a tooth's nerve?""""There's no evidence to date that the tooth whitening process has a harmful effect on the health of a tooth's nerve. One study reported that at both a 4.5 and 7-year follow up, no individual who used a tooth whitening system needed a ""'root canal'' procedure on any teeth that had been whitened.''Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic Department of Dentistry.''Edited by Charlotte E.

Facts you should know about teething," Teething is the process by which a baby's teeth erupt, or break through, the gums. Teething generally occurs between 6 to 24 months of age. Symptoms of teething include irritability, tender and swollen gums, and the infant wanting to place objects or fingers into the mouth in an attempt to reduce discomfort. Fever, cough, diarrhea, and cold symptoms are not found when a child is teething. Oral over-the-counter pain relievers (acetaminophen [Tylenol] or ibuprofen [Children's Advil/Motrin]) generally provide relief of symptoms. Topical medications containing benzocaine may cause serious and potentially lethal side effects and should not be used to treat teething symptoms."
What is teething?,"""Teething is the process by which an infant's ""'teeth'' erupt, or break through, the gums. Teething is also referred to as ""cutting"" of the teeth. Teething is medically termed odontiasis.' "
When do babies start teething?,"'The onset of teething symptoms typically precedes the eruption of a tooth by several days. While a baby\'s first tooth can appear between 4 and 10 months of age, the first tooth usually erupts at approximately 6 months of age. Some dentists have noted a family pattern of ""early,"" ""average,"" or ""late"" teethers.''A relatively rare condition, ""natal"" teeth, describes the presence of a tooth on the day of birth. The incidence of such an event is one per 2,000-3,000 live births. Usually, this single and often somewhat malformed tooth is a unique event in an otherwise normal child. Rarely, the presence of a natal tooth is just one of several unusual physical findings which make up a syndrome. If the possibility of a syndrome exists, consultation with a pediatric dentist and/or geneticist can be helpful. The natal tooth is often loose and is commonly removed prior to the ''newborn'""'s hospital discharge to eliminate the risk of aspiration into the ""'lungs''.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of teething?,"'Teething is generally associated with gum and jaw discomfort as the infant\'s tooth prepares to erupt through the gum surface. As the tooth moves beneath the surface of the gum tissue, the area may appear slightly red or swollen. Sometimes a fluid-filled area similar to a ""blood ''blister''"" may be seen over the erupting tooth. Some teeth may be more sensitive than others when they erupt. The larger molars may cause more discomfort due to their larger surface area that can\'t ""slice"" through the gum tissue as an erupting incisor is capable of doing. With the exception of the eruption of the third molars (''wisdom teeth''), eruption of permanent teeth rarely cause the discomfort associated with eruption of ""baby"" (primary or deciduous) teeth.''Teething may cause the following symptoms:''Importantly, teething is ''not'' associated with the following symptoms:'  Increased drooling Restless or decreased sleeping due to gum discomfort Refusal of food due to soreness of the gum region Fussiness that comes and goes Bringing hands to the mouth Mild rash around the mouth due to skin irritation secondary to excessive drooling Rubbing the cheek or ear region as a consequence of referred pain during the eruption of the molars Fever (especially over 101 F) Diarrhea, runny nose, and cough Prolonged fussiness Rashes over the body"
Can teething cause a fever?,"'Even though grandmothers may debate the findings, research has not shown a causal relationship between teething and development of a fever. Viral infections, which commonly occur independently simultaneous with dental eruptions, may product a fever. However, there is no teething virus.' "
Can teething cause vomiting?,"'The process of teething is not causally related to ''vomiting''. As several pediatric dentists have noted, ""Teething does not cause fever, runny nose, cough, or ''diarrhea''. Teething causes teeth.""' "
What is the order of tooth eruption?,"'The following is the general order of eruption of primary teeth:''Between 6 to 12 years of age, the roots of these 20 ""baby"" teeth degenerate, allowing their replacement with 32 permanent ""adult"" teeth. The third molars (""''wisdom teeth''"") have no preceding ""baby"" version and generally erupt in mid to late adolescence. Because of their tendency to promote crowding and crooked orientation, they are often removed.'  Central incisors: 6-12 months of age Lateral incisors: 9-16 months of age Canine teeth: 16-23 months of age First molars: 13-19 months of age Second molars: 22-24 months of age"
How long does teething last?,"'Children will commonly have variable discomfort during the few days before tooth eruption through the gum line. Some ''babies'' are bothered more than others during the migration through the tissues deep to the gum line. Because of their shape, molars are more likely to be associated with teething discomfort.' "
When should you call the pediatrician about teething pain?,"'Because teething is so common and other symptoms such as fever, fussiness, and diarrhea are also common, both conditions may often occur at the same time. Other illnesses or disorders (such as viral infections) are much more likely to be causing fever, fussiness, and/or ''nasal congestion'' with cough and diarrhea. It is important to contact a doctor if these or other symptoms seem concerning. Do not assume that they are just from teething.' "
What medications are safe to use to treat teething pain?,"'Some controversy surrounds the use of pain medicines.'""While some parents endorse topical medicines, studies haven't consistently shown their benefit. The FDA issued a warning in May 2011 urging avoidance of oral medications containing the topical anesthetic benzocaine (such as Orajel). Benzocaine is the main ingredient of many over-the-counter teething sprays, lozenges, and gels. The FDA warning points out an association with ""'methemoglobinemia'', a rare but extremely serious complication. This side effect substantially limits the ability of ''red blood cells'' to transport oxygen throughout the body. This development may produce serious to lethal consequences. Individuals who develop methemoglobinemia will become pale, lightheaded, confused, and short of breath. A rapid ''heart'' rate is also common. Such an adverse reaction may develop upon first exposure or after several exposures to benzocaine. Any individual who has such symptoms after exposure to benzocaine should seek immediate medical attention at the closest emergency room. A medication can be used to reverse these side effects.''Alcohol'' should ''never'' be used to numb the gums.'""Ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help with pain. Ibuprofen shouldn't be given to infants younger than 6 months of age. Medications should be used only for the few times when other home-care methods do not help. Caution should be taken not to overmedicate for teething. The medicine may mask significant symptoms that could be important to know about. Do not give a child products containing ""'aspirin''. No prescription ''drugs'' are routinely given for teething.' "
What home remedies provide relief for teething pain?,"'Teething infants often feel better when gentle pressure is placed on their gums. For this reason, many doctors recommend gently rubbing the gums with a clean finger or having the child bite down on a clean washcloth. If the pain seems to be causing feeding problems, sometimes a different shaped ''nipple'"" or use of a cup may reduce discomfort and improve feeding. Cold objects many help reduce inflammation as well. Veteran parents have discovered the usefulness of frozen washcloths and ice cubes for this purpose. Be careful to avoid having prolonged contact of very cold objects on the gums. Never put anything in a child's mouth (including teething biscuits) that might make the child choke. Homeopathic preparations for teething should be viewed with caution since the purity and concentration of ingredients are not guaranteed. Such products are not subject to FDA (Food and Drug Administration) review."" "
How do you care for your baby's new teeth?,"'Oral hygiene may be started even before eruption of the first tooth. Twice-a-day cleaning of the gums using the washrag used for cleaning the face and hands after eating is effective and simple. Fluoride has been shown to be extremely effective in reducing the development and severity of ''cavities'"". Since fluoride amounts vary by water source, check with the child's pediatrician or dentist regarding any supplementation that may be necessary. Fluoride recommendations will be based upon fluoride concentration in water consumed and the age of the child. An excess of fluoride may cause ""'fluorosis -- permanent'"" staining of the teeth. Children's teeth seem most vulnerable during the first three years of life. For this reason, fluoridated ""'toothpaste'' is rarely necessary for children less than 3 years of age. Maternal fluoride supplementation during ''pregnancy'"" has not been shown to benefit fetal dental integrity or protect the child's baby or permanent teeth from ""'cavity'' formation.''Infants and children should never take a bottle to their crib or bed. Formula, ''breast milk'"", cow's milk, ""'soy'' milk, and juice all can be associated with ''cavity'' formation. Ingestion of sticky fruit (such as raisins) or other foods heavily laden with ''sugar'' (such as candy) is also associated with an increase in cavity formation.' "
When should my baby visit the dentist for the first time?,"'The American Dental Association and the American Academy of ''Pediatrics'' recommend the first dental visit be at 1 year of age. If a delayed schedule is chosen, the latest time for a first dental visit is 3 years of age. ''Trauma'', oral malformations, staining of the teeth, dental pain, and unusual changes of the teeth or gums would warrant a dental visit when first noted by the parent.' "
Introduction,"'The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum, is divided into four paired sections -- the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes. Each lobe controls a specific group of activities. The temporal lobe, located on either side of the brain just above the ear, plays an important role in ''hearing'', language, and memory. In people with temporal lobe ''epilepsy'', the area where the ''seizures'' start -- called the ''seizure'' focus -- is located within the temporal lobe. This is the most common type of ''epilepsy'' in ''teens'' and adults.' "
What Is a Temporal Lobe Resection?, 
Who Is a Candidate for Temporal Lobe Resection?,"'Temporal lobe resection may be an option for people with ''epilepsy'"" whose seizures are disabling and/or not controlled by medication, or when the side effects of medication are severe and significantly affect the person's quality of life. In addition, it must be possible to remove the brain tissue that contains the seizure focus without causing damage to areas of the brain responsible for vital functions, such as movement, sensation, language, and memory."" "
What Happens Before a Temporal Lobe Resection?,"'Candidates for temporal lobe resection undergo an extensive pre-surgery evaluation -- including seizure monitoring, electroencephalography (''EEG''),''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), and positron emission tomography (PET). These tests help to pinpoint the seizure focus within the temporal lobe and to determine if surgery is possible.' "
What Happens During a Temporal Lobe Resection?,"'A temporal lobe resection requires exposing an area of the brain using a procedure called a craniotomy. (""Crani"" refers to the skull and ""otomy"" means ""to cut into."") After the patient is put to ''sleep'' with anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision (cut) in the ''scalp'', removes a piece of bone and pulls back a section of the dura, the tough membrane that covers the brain. This creates a ""window"" in which the surgeon inserts special instruments for removing the brain tissue. Surgical microscopes also are used to give the surgeon a magnified view of the area of the brain involved. The surgeon utilizes information gathered during the pre-operative evaluation -- as well as during surgery -- to define, or map out, the route to the correct area of the temporal lobe.''In some cases, a portion of the surgery is performed while the patient is awake, using medication to keep the person relaxed and ''pain''-free. This is done so that the patient can help the surgeon find and avoid areas of the brain responsible for vital functions. While the patient is awake, the doctor uses special probes to stimulate different areas of the brain. At the same time, the patient is asked to count, identify pictures, or perform other tasks. The surgeon can then determine the area of the brain associated with each task.' "
What Happens After Temporal Lobe Resection?,"'The patient generally stays in the hospital for two to four days. Most people having temporal lobe resection surgery will be able to return to their normal activities, including work or school, in six to eight weeks after surgery. The hair over the incision will grow back and hide the surgical ''scar''. Most patients will need to continue taking anti-seizure medication for two or more years after surgery. Once seizure control is established, medications may be reduced or eliminated.' "
How Effective Is a Temporal Lobe Resection?,'Temporal lobe resection is successful in eliminating or significantly reducing seizures in 70% to 90% of patients.' 
What Are the Side Effects of Temporal Lobe Resection?,"'The following symptoms may occur after surgery, although they generally go away on their own:' Scalp numbness. Nausea. Feeling tired or depressed. Headaches. Difficulty speaking, remembering, or finding words. Continued auras (feelings that signal the start of a seizure)."
What Are the Risks of a Temporal Lobe Resection?,"'The complication rate with temporal lobe resection is low, but there are some risks, including:''WebMD Medical Reference' Risks associated with surgery, including infection, bleeding, and allergic reaction to anesthesia. Failure to relieve seizures. Changes in personality or mental abilities. Pain."
Facts you should know about temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome," The temporomandibular joint is the joint that connects your jaw to your skull. When this joint is injured or damaged, it can lead to a localized pain disorder called temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome or temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Causes of TMJ disorders include injury to the teeth or jaw, misalignment of the teeth or jaw, teeth grinding or clenching, poor posture, stress, arthritis, and gum chewing. Signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome includejaw pain,jaw clicking and popping,ear pain/earache,popping sounds in ears,headaches,stiff or sore jaw muscles,pain in the temple area, orlocking of the jaw joint. jaw pain, jaw clicking and popping, ear pain/earache, popping sounds in ears, headaches, stiff or sore jaw muscles, pain in the temple area, or locking of the jaw joint. TMJ disorders often responds to home remedies, including ice packs to the joint, over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), avoiding chewing gum, massage or gentle stretches of the jaw and neck, and stress reduction. When home treatment does not work, medical treatment for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome includes dental splints, Botox injections, physical therapy, prescription medications, and in severe cases, surgery. The prognosis for TMD is generally good as people usually can manage the disorder with self-care and home remedies."
What is temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome?,"'Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome is a disorder of the jaw muscles and nerves caused by injury or inflammation to the temporomandibular joint. The temporomandibular joint is the connection between the jawbone and the skull. The injured or inflamed temporomandibular joint leads to pain with chewing, clicking, crackling, and popping of the jaw; swelling on the sides of the face; nerve inflammation; ''headaches'', including ''migraines''; tooth grinding (''bruxism''); Eustachian tube dysfunction; and sometimes dislocation of the temporomandibular joint. Temporomandibular joint syndrome is also known as temporomandibular joint disorder.' "
What are the risk factors for TMJ syndrome?,'There are several risk factors for TMD:'   Poor posture in the neck and upper back muscles may lead to neck strain and abnormalities of jaw muscle function. Stress may increase muscle tension and jaw clenching. Women 18-44 years of age have increased risk. Patients with other chronic inflammatory arthritis have increased risk. People with jaw trauma or poorly positioned teeth have increased risk. People who have a genetic predisposition to pain sensitivity and increased stress responses may be more susceptible.
What causes TMJ syndrome?,"'Medical professionals do no completely understand the causes of TMD. Multiple factors contribute to the muscle tightness and dysfunction that characterize this condition. It is not clear whether some of these causes directly lead to TMJ syndrome or if they are a result of the disorder. Causes may include'   misalignment (malocclusion) of or trauma to the teeth or jaw, teeth grinding (bruxism), poor posture, stress or anxiety, arthritis and other inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders, orthodontic braces, and excessive gum chewing."
What are TMJ syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'The main TMD symptom is pain in the jaw joint. This joint is located just in front of the ear, and pain associated with TMD may involve the face, eye, forehead, ear, or neck. Signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction include the following:'

How do health care professionals diagnose TMJ syndrome?,"""A doctor will diagnose TMD by taking the patient's medical history and doing a physical exam to find the cause of the symptoms. There is no specific test to diagnose TMD. A doctor may send the patient to an oral and maxillofacial specialist, an otolaryngologist (also called an ear, nose, and throat doctor or ENT specialist), or a dentist specializing in jaw disorders to confirm the diagnosis. Sometimes a health care professional may order an ""'MRI'' of the temporomandibular joint to detect damage to the cartilage of the jaw joint and to rule out other medical problems.''A condition that may have some similar symptoms to TMD is ''trigeminal neuralgia''. The trigeminal nerve supplies nerve impulses to the temporomandibular joint, and when irritated, it can cause facial pain. Other causes of face or ''neck pain'' include ''swollen lymph nodes'' (swollen glands), ''giant cell arteritis'', salivary gland disease, ''sore throat'', ill-fitting ''dentures'', or dental ''braces''.' "
8 Most popular treatments and 6 home remedies for TMJ pain relief,"'Many symptoms of TMJ disorders can respond well to home remedies or stress reduction and relaxation techniques. The best home remedies may provide some relief are:''When home remedies are not effective, medical treatment options may be necessary. Most of these types of treatments and remedies will not cure TMD, but they can provide temporary and even long-term relief from the pain symptoms. These most common treatments include the following:'   Ice or cold packs to the area of the joint Over-the-counter (OTC) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve), and other pain relievers, including aspirin (Ecotrin) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) Eating soft foods and avoiding chewing gum Massage or gentle self-stretching of the jaw and neck muscles (A doctor or physical therapist can recommend appropriate stretches.) Relaxation techniques and stress management and reduction Some sedative essential oils (such as lavender, chamomile, sweet marjoram, and clary sage) may provide temporary relief from the pain and discomfort of TMJ. A dental splint (occlusal splint or stabilization splint or bite guard), which is a dental appliance placed in the mouth that keeps the teeth in alignment and prevents tooth grinding. This resembles a mouth guard and is usually prescribed and fitted by a jaw specialist. A medical professional may use Botox to relax the muscles of the jaw. However, this is not currently an FDA-approved treatment for TMD. Physical therapy with jaw exercises can strengthen muscles, improve flexibility, and range of motion. In states where medical marijuana is legal, a physician may prescribe it to help with severe TMJ pain. Biobehavioral management (biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) may help diminish pain intensity. Trigger point acupuncture can sometimes be helpful. In severe cases, surgery on the jaw or dental surgery may be necessary.TMJ arthroscopy or arthrocentesis is a minimally invasive procedure usually done in an outpatient setting. The recovery time for this procedure is about a week.Sometimes a total joint replacement may be necessary. This generally requires a stay in the hospital for several days, and surgery recovery time is four to six weeks.

What types of doctors treat TMJ?,"""A primary care provider (PCP), such as a family practitioner, internist, or a child's pediatrician, may first diagnose your TMJ. Your doctor may refer you to an oral and maxillofacial specialist, an otolaryngologist (also called an ear, nose, and throat doctor or ENT specialist), or a dentist specializing in jaw disorders (prosthodontist, also called a prosthetic dentist) for further treatment. You may also see a pain-management specialist if your TMJ pain is severe."" "
What is the prognosis for TMJ syndrome?,"'The prognosis for TMJ syndrome is generally good. There are numerous causes for TMJ syndrome, so the outlook depends on the cause, if known. Most people can manage the discomfort with self-care and home remedies.''Complications of long-term TMJ syndrome include chronic face pain or chronic ''headaches''. In severe situations, where pain is chronic, or associated with other inflammatory disorders, long-term treatment may be necessary.' "
Is it possible to prevent TMJ syndrome?,"'Symptoms of TMJ syndrome tend to be episodic and related to stress and lifestyle.''Prevention'' of TMJ syndrome symptoms can often be achieved using self-care at home, such as'   eating soft foods; avoiding chewing gum; maintaining proper posture; practicing stress reduction and relaxation techniques; using dental splint appliances as recommended by a jaw care professional; using proper safety equipment to prevent jaw fractures and dislocations while exercising, working, or participating in sports."

They help to move the muscles or bones of your shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle joints.''Repeated injury to these tendons may result in redness, swelling, soreness, and pain (inflammation) around your joint called “tendinitis or tendonitis.” It is also called “overuse tendinopathy.”' "
What are the symptoms of tendinitis?,"'If you have tendinitis you may''You must seek medical help if you are having pain, redness, and swelling that worsen rapidly.' Experience redness, swelling, and pain at the site of the tendon or surrounding area. Be unable to move the body part or joint where the tendon is swollen."
What are the causes of tendinitis?,"'Causes include:' Repetitive, minor trauma on the affected area or from a sudden but severe injury during certain activities such as gardening, raking, throwing pitching, tennis, golf, or skiing Sitting or standing for a long time in an incorrect posture at work or home or exercising or playing sports in an incorrect posture Insufficient warming exercises before starting weight-lifting or sports activity Certain defects since birth in the bone or joints such as length differences in the legs Certain joints or hormonal diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, and thyroid disorders Unusual side effects of certain drugs Over-exercising or exercising too hard Certain infections such as infections from a cat or dog bite to the hand or a finger"
Facts you should know about rotator cuff disease," The rotator cuff is a group of four tendons. Rotator cuff disease is one of the most common causes of shoulder pain. The rotator cuff can be injured by degeneration, inflammation, or trauma. The diagnosis of rotator cuff disease can be confirmed by radiology testing. The treatment of rotator cuff disease depends on the severity of the injury to the tendons of the rotator cuff."
What is the rotator cuff?,"'The rotator cuff is the group of four tendons that stabilize the shoulder joint. The tendons hook up to the four muscles that move the shoulder in various directions.''There are four muscles whose tendons form the rotator cuff: the subscapularis muscle, which moves the arm by turning it inward (internal rotation); the supraspinatus muscle, which is responsible for elevating the arm and moving it away from the body; the infraspinatus muscle, which assists the lifting of the arm during turning the arm outward (external rotation); and the teres minor muscle, which also helps in the outward turning of the arm.' "
What causes rotator cuff disease?,"'Rotator cuff disease is damage to the rotator cuff from any cause. It can be from an acute injury or from repetitive ''strains''. This can lead to minor strain injury, partial tear of the tendons, or complete tear of tendons with loss of shoulder joint function. ''Rotator cuff injury'' is one of the most common causes of shoulder ''pain''.'  "
What are risk factors for rotator cuff disease?,"'Risk factors for rotator cuff disease include any activity that involves sudden strain movements of the shoulder against resistance. These include lifting weights, lifting overhead, tennis, ''swimming'', sports where objects are thrown (baseball or softball pitchers, football quarterbacks, etc.), and taking luggage off of racks, etc.' "
How is the rotator cuff injured?,"'The rotator cuff can be injured because of degeneration with ''aging'' or inflammation due to tendinitis, ''bursitis'', or ''arthritis'' of the shoulder. The rotator cuff is commonly injured by trauma (such as from falling and injuring the shoulder or overuse in sports). Rotator cuff injury is particularly common in people who perform repetitive overhead motions that can ''stress'' the rotator cuff. These motions are frequently associated with muscle ''fatigue''.'  "
What are rotator cuff disease symptoms and signs?,"'The most common symptom of rotator cuff disease is shoulder ''pain''. The pain is often noticed gradually and may be first noticed even a day after the actual event that may have caused the injury. Sometimes, a sudden pain occurs during a sport activity. The pain is usually located to the front and side of the shoulder and is increased when the shoulder is moved away from the body. The pain is usually noted to be more intense at nighttime and sometimes increases when lying on the affected shoulder. The pain can diminish range of motion and movement of the arm. The inflammation from the rotator cuff disease and the lack of movement due to pain can result in a ''frozen shoulder''. There can also be tenderness in the area of the inflamed tendons of the ''injured rotator cuff''.''People with rotator cuff disease usually find it difficult to lift the arm away from the body fully. If the rotator cuff disease involves severe tears of the rotator cuff tendons, it can be impossible for the patient to hold the arm up because of pain and decreased function of the tendons and muscles.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose rotator cuff disease?,"""Rotator cuff disease is suggested by the patient's history of activities and symptoms of pain in the shoulder described above. In making a diagnosis, the doctor can observe increased pain with certain movements of the shoulder. The pain is due to local inflammation and swelling in the injured tendons of the rotator cuff. Additionally, with severe tendon tears of the rotator cuff, the arm falls due to ""'weakness'' (positive drop arm sign) when moved away from the body.''The diagnosis of rotator cuff disease can be confirmed by radiology testing. Sometimes ''X-rays'' can show bony injuries, which suggest long-standing severe rotator cuff disease. An arthrogram involves injecting contrast dye into the shoulder joint to detect leakage out of the injured rotator cuff. The ''MRI'' is a noninvasive imaging test that uses a magnet and computer to produce detailed images of the tissues of the shoulder. An MRI has the added advantage of providing more information than either X-ray or an arthrogram, especially if a condition other than rotator cuff disease is present.' "
What is the treatment for rotator cuff disease?,"'The treatment of rotator cuff disease depends on the severity of the injury to the tendons of the rotator cuff and the underlying condition of the patient.''Mild rotator cuff disease is treated with ice, rest, and anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''ibuprofen'' [''Advil'', ''Motrin''] and others). Generally, physical therapy using gradual ''exercise'' rehabilitation is instituted. Exercises are used that are specifically designed for rotator-cuff strengthening.''Patients with persistent pain and motion limitation can often benefit by a ''cortisone injection'' around the rotator cuff. Repeat injections may be necessary.''More severe rotator cuff disease can require surgical repair.''Subacromial decompression is the removal of a small portion of the bone (acromion) and soft tissues (bursa) that surround the rotator cuff. This removal can relieve pressure on the rotator cuff in certain conditions and promote healing and recovery. This procedure can be done by arthroscopic or open surgical techniques. Both methods have been reported to be equally successful.''The most severe rotator cuff disease, complete full-thickness rotator cuff tears, usually requires surgery for the best results. These procedures, which can also be done by either ''arthroscopy'' or open surgery, involve mending the torn rotator cuff by suturing the tissues back together. Ultimately, recovery from rotator cuff disease often requires extended physical therapy and rehabilitation.'  "
Are there home remedies for rotator cuff disease?,"'Mild rotator cuff disease is treated with ''cold'' packs, rest, and anti-inflammatory medications (such as ibuprofen and others). It is essential to avoid reinjuring the shoulder by avoiding activities that ''stress'' the joint.' "
What are complications of rotator cuff disease?,'The most serious complication of rotator cuff disease is ''frozen shoulder''. Frozen shoulder is a result of scarring that occurs around the inflamed joint and leads to loss of range of motion and function of the joint. Frozen shoulder is also referred to as ''adhesive capsulitis''.' 
What specialists treat rotator cuff disease?,"'Specialists who treat rotator cuff disease include generalists, including general practitioners, family practitioners, and internists, as well as orthopedic surgeons, physiatrists, ''rheumatologists'', and physical therapists.' "
"What is the prognosis 
(outlook) for rotator cuff disease?","'Without treatment, the shoulder can permanently lose full function from rotator cuff disease. Minor rotator cuff injuries cause mild to moderate dysfunction. Severe rotator cuff injuries can cause complete dysfunction of the shoulder joint. Scarring around the shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) can lead to a marked restriction of the range of shoulder motion (frozen shoulder).''Extensive need for rehabilitation and physical therapy is the norm with significant rotator cuff disease. Some patients never recover full function of the shoulder joint.' "
Is it possible to prevent rotator cuff disease?,"'Rotator cuff disease can be prevented by avoiding injury to the tendons of the shoulder. Rotator cuff disease can also be prevented by strengthening the rotator cuff muscles with exercises designed for this purpose. Repetitive strains, especially arm movements over the head, should be limited.' "
What is tennis elbow?,"'Tennis elbow is inflammation of the tendon at the outer portion of the elbow, leading to ''pain''. Classically, tennis elbow is a strain injury to this tendon from hitting a backhand shot at tennis. The medical term for tennis elbow is ''lateral epicondylitis'' because it involves inflammation at the insertion point of the tendon at the outer portion of the humerus bone at the elbow joint (the epicondyle). Most people with lateral ''epicondylitis'' actually acquire it from activities other than playing tennis.''In contrast, when the tendon that attaches at the inner portion of the elbow is inflamed, the condition is referred to as medial epicondylitis (or ""golfer\'s elbow"" because golfers commonly injure this area after striking the ground to take a deep divot).' "
What causes tennis elbow?,"'A strain injury to the tendon at the outer portion of the elbow causes tennis elbow. While this can occur by straining during a backhand tennis shot, it can also occur from many repetitive activities that can strain the elbow. These activities include using a screwdriver or work that includes similar motions, Frisbee disc throwing, and lifting objects by extending the wrist, etc.'  "
"What are tennis 
elbow risk factors?","'Risks of tennis elbow include any activity that can strain the elbow joint. Such activities include tennis, falling onto the extended upper extremity, using a screwdriver when unaccustomed, casting a fishing net, etc.' "
What are symptoms of tennis elbow?,"'Symptoms of tennis elbow include dull pain and tenderness at the outer elbow. There can be elbow stiffness and a sensation of weakness. Typically with tennis elbow, people retain the full range of motion of the elbow and there is no significant swelling or discoloration. Holding a beverage cup or ''shaking hands'' can bring on the pain.'  "
How do physicians diagnose tennis elbow?,"'Physicians diagnose tennis elbow based on the history of outer ''elbow pain'' and tenderness often with recent repetitive-use injury. Tenderness at the outer elbow with normal range of motion of the elbow joint assures the diagnosis. Generally, no radiology testing is necessary. ''MRI'' scanning can illustrate inflammation of the outer elbow.' "
What is the treatment for tennis elbow?,"'Resting the elbow and employing measures to reduce the local inflammation are effective treatments for tennis elbow. ''Cold'' application several times daily and anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''ibuprofen'' [''Advil''] or ''naproxen'' [''Aleve'']) can be helpful. Physical therapy and rehabilitation exercises for the elbow that are guided by therapists can be helpful for persisting pain and inflammation. For tennis elbow that is resistant to these measures, local ''cortisone injection'' can be beneficial. Rarely, surgical repair of the injured tendon is considered.'  "
What is the outlook (prognosis) for tennis elbow?,"'Tennis elbow most often has a complete recovery with conservative measures, particularly by resting the joint and avoiding reinjury.' "
Is it possible to prevent tennis elbow?,'Avoiding strain injury of the elbow joint can prevent tennis elbow. Tennis players can benefit by proper instruction in hitting techniques. Tennis elbow straps can be used to minimize the risk of injury to the elbow tendons.''Exercises that strengthen the involved muscles can be helpful to avoid a reoccurrence once symptoms have disappeared.' 
What is a tennis elbow?,"'A ''tennis elbow'', also known as ''lateral epicondylitis'', is a condition in which the swelling of the tendon causes ''pain'' in the elbow or arm. Tendons are a band of tissues that connects the muscles of the lower arm to the bone. A ''tennis elbow'' is the most common cause of ''elbow pain''. It commonly affects people aged 40 years. It usually requires minor treatment, time, and rest to heal.' "
What are the symptoms of a tennis elbow?,"'The symptoms of a tennis elbow develop over time. In most cases, ''pain'' is mild, which then progresses to be severe over weeks and months. Common signs and symptoms of a tennis elbow include:' Pain or burning in the outer part of the elbow Nocturnal pain Weak grip strength Tenderness"
What are the causes of a tennis elbow?,"'A tennis elbow develops gradually. Repetitive use of the muscles around the elbows is the main cause of developing a tennis elbow. Vigorous and repetitive use of the forearm muscle or repetitive stretching of the wrists and hands can lead to a tennis elbow. The extensor carpi radialis brevis (ERCB) muscle stabilizes the wrist when the elbow is straight. When ERCB is weakened from overuse, small tears form in the tendons leading to inflammation and pain.''Activities that may trigger a tennis elbow include:''Other factors associated with a tennis elbow are as follows:' Tennis Squash Weightlifting Fencing Typing Raking Knitting Racquetball Painting Plumbing Carpentry Autoworkers Cooking Butchering Age between 30 and 50 years Idiopathic cause (unknown cause)"
What tests are used to diagnose a tennis elbow?,"'The physician may ask for patients’ detailed history, which would aid them in making a diagnosis. Moreover, the physician may ask for additional tests, which include:' X-rays Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan Electromyography (EMG)"
How is a tennis elbow treated?,"'Tennis elbow management involves both nonsurgical and surgical methods. Approximately, 80-95% of patients have success with nonsurgical treatment.''Physicians may recommend surgery if the symptoms do not respond to 6-12 months of nonsurgical treatment.''The surgical procedure mainly involves removing the diseased muscle and reattaching healthy muscle back to the bone.''There are two types of surgery performed to treat a tennis elbow:' Resting your arm is of utmost importance because it heals the inflammation and pain. Avoiding heavy activities and decreased participation in sports for some time can help in relieving painful symptoms. Using ice to foment the elbows immediately as the pain starts is a good way to stop swelling from increasing. Medications such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) and Motrin (ibuprofen) may ease swelling and pain. Steroids such as cortisone alleviate inflammation. The physician may inject steroids around the bony area to relieve painful symptoms. Specific exercises may help to strengthen the muscles of the forearms. Ice-massage or muscle-stimulating techniques may aid in improving muscle healing. Physicians may recommend the usage of a brace to relax the muscles and tendons, thus relieving the symptoms of a tennis elbow. Physicians may consider injecting platelet-rich plasma to improve the biologic environment of the tissue. A small sample of blood is collected from the arm and centrifuged to obtain platelets from the solution. This therapy is still under consideration because there are studies that either defend or oppose the effectiveness of this therapy. Shock wave therapy sends sound waves to the elbows to create microtrauma that promotes the body’s natural healing process. Open surgery: Done via a cut on the surface Arthroscopic surgery: Done via special tools and a camera. Its advantage is a smaller cut on the skin."
Electrical nerve stimulation history,"'For several thousand years, people have recognized that electrical stimulation can have an impact on ''pain''. Hippocrates, the father of medicine, is said to have used electric fish to cause numbness, and a report of ''gout'' being “cured” by accidental contact with a fish called an electric ray dates back to the first century. Later reports also described ''pain'' resolution that occurred when similar types of “electric” fish were placed on afflicted body parts.'""It wasn't until the 18th century when a more formal device to deliver electricity to decrease pain was created. Although initially developed in Europe, Benjamin Franklin is credited with reforming the original electric condenser, which was used to ""'shock'' patients in an effort to treat various ailments.\xa0' "
What is a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit?,"'Today, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation units, or TENS units, are commonly used to treat many types of pain, including chronic back and ''neck pain''. Unlike the early devices, where the amount of electricity delivered might vary, TENS units supply a controlled electrical current to stimulate nerve endings through surface electrodes, which are placed over the affected region.'  "
How does transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation work?,"'The rationale for using a TENS unit for pain control is based on the inability of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves to multi-task -- that is, impulses that are being carried along a pathway within the nervous system effectively block that pathway from transmitting other signals. In essence, flooding a pathway with low-level stimulation keeps pain signals from reaching the brain.''TENS units are reported to work rapidly, although it can take some adjustment to find the correct level of stimulation. Additionally, TENS units are portable, which can improve the mobility of a patient experiencing ''chronic pain''. However, not all types of pain respond to this method of treatment and any effect tends to be short-lived; pain quickly recurs once the stimulator is removed.' "
Who is a good candidate for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation?,"""Although this therapy isn't for everyone, individuals looking for a relatively inexpensive, well-tolerated treatment option with few side effects may find a TENS unit a good option to explore.""  "
What is a tension headache?,"""Headache -- a condition so common it's the punch line for a number of jokes, but when you're experiencing a headache, it's no laughing matter.""""When most people discuss headache, they're typically referring to the most frequently experienced type of headache, a tension headache (also known as tension-type or ""'stress'' headache). Almost half of adults experienced a headache in the past year; fortunately, for the majority of those individuals, the headache was mild, short-lived, and likely fell into the category of tension headache.''Children and ''teens'' can experience tension headache; with a significant percentage of children having experienced tension headache by age 15. Females are often diagnosed with tension headaches (more often, about twice as often) than males.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of a tension headache?,"'Most tension headaches occur infrequently, and are usually short-lived (resolves within minutes to a few hours). In rare cases the headache may last for many days. A tension headaches that occur more than 15 days each month are referred to as chronic tension headaches.''Tension headaches are not associated with ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'', and do not have symptoms like flashing lights, blind spots, or numbness or ''weakness'' of the arms or legs which precede the headache. These symptoms can help distinguish tension headaches from other types of headaches (for example, migraine headaches).'   The pain of chronic tension headache tends to wax and wane in severity. The pain associated with tension headache typically impacts the whole head, but may begin in the back of the head or above the eyebrows. Some people experience a cap or band-like sensation which encircles their skull, while others describe their pain as a muscle tension in their neck or shoulder regions. The pain is frequently described as constant and pressure-like. The pain tends to come on gradually and even at maximum intensity is not incapacitating. Most people who have a tension headache are able to continue their daily activities despite the pain. In some cases, people with tension headache report some sensitivity to light or sound."
What causes tension headaches?,"""The exact cause of tension headache isn't known; and many factors probably play a role in why people develop headache. These factors may include:""'Underlying diseases or conditions may frequently cause a headache, for example:''In children, headache may be seen as a response to changes in school or home situations such as:' lack of sleep, skipping meals, or increased stress (leading to a frequent description of these headaches as stress headaches). eye strain, muscular tension caused by poor posture, over exertion, or anxiety. a new sibling, testing at school, or social isolation."
How are tension headaches treated and diagnosed?,"""Tension headaches are diagnosed based on the patient's reported history of the headache and physical examination. There is no test to specifically confirm tension headache. Because the physical examination in patients with tension headache is generally normal, additional testing such as ""'CT scan'' or ''MRI'"" scan usually isn't required. Some basic blood work may be done to confirm that no underlying abnormality is present.""'Treatment for tension headaches include prescription medications, ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) pain relievers, combination ''drugs'' containing ''aspirin'', ''acetaminophen'', ''caffeine'', and stress management.' "
What home remedies relieve pain and other symptoms of tension headaches?,"   Alternative treatments or therapies: Alternative therapies such as a hot compress or an ice pack may provide substantial benefit for some individuals. Hydrate: Sometimes headaches can be triggered by mild dehydration or lack of food; if so, drinking some non-caffeinated fluids or eating something may help. Flaxseed: People who eat flaxseed, which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, may experience a decrease in headaches. This is thought to be related to the anti-inflammatory properties of the omega-3 fatty acids. Peppermint or lavender oil: Inhaling the scent of peppermint oil or lavender oil may help decrease headache pain (lavender oil should not be consumed orally). Scalp massage: A scalp massage is easily done and may provide significant relief; concentrating efforts over the temporal regions or the occipital area (the back of the scalp) may lead to the best response. Whole-body massage: Whole body massage may provide relief. Stress management: If stress seems to be a trigger, learning stress-management techniques or relaxation techniques can provide substantial benefit. Exercise: Exercise, whether regular aerobic activities or specific movements to improve posture, has been shown to be quite effective in decreasing the frequency of tension headaches."
What OTC and prescription medications treat pain and manage tension headaches?,"'Many people treat tension headache on their own, using OTC (over-the-counter) medications like acetaminophen (''Tylenol''), ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin''), or combination medications containing acetaminophen, aspirin, and ''caffeine'' (Excedrin). While these medications can be effective and when taken as directed are safe for most people, overuse can lead to headaches which are more frequent and severe. This can occur if these agents are used more than 2 days each week routinely. If tension headache occurs during ''pregnancy'', the patient should contact her physician about medications that are safe to use.''If a diagnosis of chronic tension headache is made or suspected, prescription medications may be used in an effort to lessen the frequency and decrease the severity of the headaches. Medications used include ''antidepressants'' and antiseizure drugs. A doctor can help determine which medicine is best for you.'   Products which contain aspirin should not be given to children due to the risk of Reye's syndrome. Chronic use of acetaminophen, or use of acetaminophen in large amounts may lead to liver toxicity (current recommended maximal dose is 3 grams per 24 hours), and a number of medications are combined with acetaminophen so patients should discuss all OTC drugs they are taking with their doctors."
"What stress management techniques can help reduce headache pain, other symptoms, and the frequency of tension headaches?","'For people who experience recurrent tension headache, ''stress management techniques'' have been an effective way of helping to decrease headache frequency and severity. This can include regular exercise, deep ''breathing'' techniques, and relaxation training. Other non-medicinal approaches can include massage therapy, heat, ice, or ''acupuncture''. Learning to identify stressful situations which trigger headache and taking steps to avoid these is also a useful strategy for many individuals.' "
Can tension headaches be prevented?,"'Often, the best defense is a good offense and this approach is frequently effective when trying to prevent tension headache. Identifying ''headache triggers'' and then attempting to avoid or modify those triggers can be a successful strategy to decrease or even eliminate a tension headache. Some people find that scheduled exercise and eating on a regular basis is beneficial. Learning and practicing relaxation techniques, including deep breathing exercises, directed relaxation of specific muscles, or meditation, can also be effective.''See your doctor if any of the following situations occur:' If a person experiences regular headaches or if they have changed in severity, location or frequency If a person experiences a headache that is very different from his or her usual headaches If previously helpful treatments are no longer effective If someone is experiencing ""The worst headache of my life"" they need to be evaluated emergently."
Is it safe to use medicine while I am pregnant?,"'There is no clear-cut answer to this question. Before you start or stop any medicine, it is always best to speak with the doctor who is caring for you while you are ''pregnant''. Read on to learn about deciding to use medicine while pregnant.' "
How should I decide whether to use a medicine while I am pregnant?,"'When deciding whether or not to use a medicine in ''pregnancy'"", you and your doctor need to talk about the medicine's benefits and risks.""'There may be times during pregnancy when using medicine is a choice. Some of the medicine choices you and your doctor make while you are pregnant may differ from the choices you make when you are not pregnant. For example, if you get a ''cold'', you may decide to ""live with"" your stuffy nose instead of using the ""stuffy nose"" medicine you use when you are not pregnant.''Other times, using medicine is not a choice - it is needed. Some women need to use medicines while they are pregnant. Sometimes, women need medicine for a few days or a couple of weeks to treat a problem like a''bladder infection'' or ''strep throat''. Other women need to use medicine every day to control long-term health problems like ''asthma'', ''diabetes'', ''depression'', or ''seizures''. Also, some women have a pregnancy problem that needs medicine treatment. These problems include severe''nausea'' and ''vomiting'', earlier pregnancy losses, or preterm ''labor''.' Benefits: what are the good things the medicine can do for me and my growing baby (fetus)? 
	 Risks: what are the ways the medicine might harm me or my growing baby (fetus)?"
Where do doctors and nurses find out about using medicines during pregnancy?,"'Doctors and nurses get information from medicine labels and packages, textbooks, and research journals. They also share knowledge with other doctors and nurses and talk to the people who make and sell medicines.'""The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the part of our country's government that controls the medicines that can and can't be sold in the United States. The FDA lets a company sell a medicine in the United States if it is safe to use and works for a certain problem. Companies that make medicines usually have to show FDA doctors and scientists whether ""'birth defects'' or other problems occur in baby animals when the medicine is given to pregnant animals. Most of the time, ''drugs'' are not studied in pregnant women.''The FDA works with the drug companies to make clear and complete labels. But in most cases, there is not much information about how a medicine affects pregnant women and their growing ''babies''. Many prescription medicine labels include the results of studies done in pregnant animals. But a medicine does not always affect growing humans and animals in the same way. Here is an example:''A medicine is given to pregnant rats. If the medicine causes problems in some of the rat babies, it may or may not cause problems in human babies. If there are no problems in the rat babies, it does not prove that the medicine will not cause problems in human babies.The FDA asks for studies in two different kinds of animals. This improves the chance that the studies can predict what may happen in pregnant women and their babies.\t'""There is a lot that FDA doctors and scientists do not know about using medicine during pregnancy. In a perfect world, every medicine label would include helpful information about the medicine's effects on pregnant women and their growing babies. Unfortunately, this is not the case."" "
What are examples of prescription medications that are safe to use during pregnancy?,"'Doctors use information from many sources when they choose medicine for a patient, including medicine labels. To help doctors, the FDA created pregnancy letter categories to help explain what is known about using medicine during pregnancy. This system assigns letter categories to all prescription medicines. The letter category is listed in the label of a prescription medicine. The label states whether studies were done in pregnant women or pregnant animals and if so, what happened. ''Over-the-counter'' (OTC) medicines do not have a pregnancy letter category. Some OTC medicines were prescription medicines first and used to have a letter category. Talk to your doctor and follow the instructions on the label before taking OTC medicines.'""The FDA chooses a medicine's letter category based on what is known about the medicine when used in pregnant women and animals.""'The FDA is working hard to gather more knowledge about using medicine during pregnancy. The FDA is also trying to make medicine labels more helpful to doctors. Medicine label information for prescription medicines is now changing, and the pregnancy part of the label will change over the next few years.' "
What over-the-counter (OTC) medications are safe to use during pregnancy?,"'Keep in mind that other things like ''caffeine'', ''vitamins'', and herbal remedies can affect the growing fetus. Talk with your doctor about cutting down on ''caffeine'' and ask which type of vitamin you should take. Never use an herbal product without talking to your doctor first.''All OTC medicines have a Drug Facts label. The Drug Facts label is arranged the same way on all OTC medicines. This makes information about using the medicine easier to find. One section of the Drug Facts label is for pregnant women. With OTC medicines, the label usually tells a pregnant woman to speak with her doctor before using the medicine. Some OTC medicines are known to cause certain problems in pregnancy. The labels for these medicines give pregnant women facts about why and when they should not use the medicine. Here are some examples:''Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDs'') like ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil''®, ''Motrin''®), ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''®), and ''aspirin'' (acetylsalicylate), can cause serious blood flow problems in the baby if used during the last third of pregnancy (after 28 weeks). Also, aspirin may increase the chance for bleeding problems in the mother and the baby during pregnancy or at delivery.''The labels for ''nicotine'' therapy drugs, like the ''nicotine patch'' and lozenge, remind women that ''smoking'' can harm an unborn child. While the medicine is thought to be safer than ''smoking'', the risks of the medicine are not fully known. Pregnant ''smokers'' are told to try quitting without the medicine first.' "
What if I'm thinking about getting pregnant?,"'If you are not pregnant yet, you can help your chances for having a healthy baby by planning ahead. Schedule a pre-pregnancy checkup. At this visit, you can talk to your doctor about the medicines, ''vitamins'', and herbs you use. It is very important that you keep treating your health problems while you are pregnant. Your doctor can tell you if you need to switch your medicine. Ask about vitamins for women who are trying to get pregnant. All women who can get pregnant should take a daily vitamin with ''folic acid'' (a B vitamin) to prevent birth defects of the brain and spinal cord. You should begin taking these vitamins before you become pregnant or if you could become pregnant. It is also a good idea to discuss caffeine, ''alcohol'', and ''smoking'' with your doctor at this time.' "
Is it safe to use medicine while I am trying to become pregnant?,"'It is hard to know exactly when you will get pregnant. Once you do get pregnant, you may not know you are pregnant for 10 to 14 days or longer. Before you start trying to get pregnant, it is wise to schedule a meeting with your doctor to discuss medicines that you use daily or every now and then. Sometimes, medicines should be changed, and sometimes they can be stopped before a woman gets pregnant. Each woman is different. So you should discuss your medicines with your doctor rather than making medicine changes on your own.' Do not stop any prescribed medicines without first talking to your doctor. 
	 Talk to your doctor before using any over-the-counter medicine.
	"
What if I get sick and need to use medicine while I am pregnant?,"'Whether or not you should use medicine during pregnancy is a serious question to discuss with your doctor. Some health problems need treatment. Not using a medicine that you need could harm you and your baby. For example, a ''urinary tract infection'' (''UTI'') that is not treated may become a ''kidney infection''. Kidney infections can cause preterm ''labor'' and low birth weight. An antibiotic is needed to get rid of a ''UTI''. Ask your doctor whether the benefits of taking a certain medicine outweigh the risks for you and your baby.' "
Should you stop taking medications during pregnancy if you have health problems?,"'If you are pregnant or thinking about ''becoming pregnant'', you should talk to your doctor about your medicines. Do not stop or change them on your own. This includes medicines for ''depression'', ''asthma'', ''diabetes'', ''seizures'' (''epilepsy''), and other health problems. Not using medicine that you need may be more harmful to you and your baby than using the medicine.''For women living with ''HIV'', the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) recommends using ''zidovudine'' (AZT) during pregnancy. Studies show that ''HIV'' positive women who use AZT during pregnancy greatly lower the risk of passing ''HIV'' to their babies. If a diabetic woman does not use her medicine during pregnancy, she raises her risk for ''miscarriage'', ''stillbirth'', and some birth defects. If ''asthma'' and ''high blood pressure'' are not controlled during pregnancy, problems with the fetus may result.' "
Are vitamins safe for me while I am pregnant?,"'Regular ''multivitamins'' and ''prenatal vitamins'' are safe to take during pregnancy and can be helpful. Women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant should take a daily multivitamin or ''prenatal'' vitamin that contains at least 400 micrograms (µg) of folic acid. It is best to start taking these vitamins before you become pregnant or if you could become pregnant. Folic acid reduces the chance of a baby having a neural tube defect, like ''spina bifida'', where the spine or brain does not form the right way. See our information on Folic Acid. Iron can help prevent a low blood count (''anemia'""). It's important to take the vitamin dose prescribed by your doctor. Too many vitamins can harm your baby. For example, very high levels of ""'vitamin A'' have been linked with severe birth defects.''''Vaccines'' and Pregnancy''''''Vaccines'' protect your body against dangerous diseases. Some ''vaccines'' are not safe to receive during pregnancy. For some vaccines, the decision to give a ''vaccine'"" during pregnancy depends on a pregnant woman's own situation. Her doctor may consider these questions before giving a vaccine:""'The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that ''Hepatitis B'' vaccination should be considered when women are at risk for developing''Hepatitis B'' during pregnancy, and inactivated ''influenza'' vaccine  should be considered for women who are pregnant during ''flu'' season. On the other hand, a pregnant woman who is not immune to ''rubella'' (''German measles'') is not given a ''rubella'' vaccine until after pregnancy. Talk with your doctor to make sure you are fully protected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides ''vaccine guidelines for pregnant women''.'

Are herbal remedies or natural products safe for me when I am pregnant?,"'Except for some vitamins, little is known about using ''dietary supplements'' while pregnant. Some herbal remedy labels claim they will help with pregnancy. But, most often there are no good studies to show if these claims are true or if the herb can cause harm to or your baby. Talk with your doctor before using any herbal product or dietary supplement. These products may contain things that could harm you or your growing baby during your pregnancy.''In the United States, there are different laws for medicines and for dietary ''supplements''. The part of the FDA that controls dietary ''supplements'' is the same part that controls foods sold in the United States. Only dietary supplements containing new dietary ingredients that were not marketed before October 15, 1994, submit safety information for review by the FDA. However, unlike medicines, herbal remedies and ""natural products"" are not approved by the FDA for safety or for what they say they will do. Most have not even been evaluated for their potential to cause harm to you or the growing fetus, let alone shown to be safe for use in pregnancy. Before a company can sell a medicine, the company must complete many studies and send the results to the FDA. Many scientists and doctors at the FDA check the study results. The FDA allows the medicine to be sold only if the studies show that the medicine works and is safe to use.' "
"In the future, will there be better ways to know if medicines are safe to use during pregnancy?","'At this time, drugs are rarely tested for safety in pregnant women for fear of harming the unborn baby. Until this changes, pregnancy exposure registries help doctors and researchers learn how medicines affect pregnant mothers and their growing baby. A pregnancy exposure registry is a study that enrolls pregnant women who are using a certain medicine. The women sign up for the study while pregnant and are followed for a certain length of time after the baby is born. Researchers compare babies with mothers who used the medicine while pregnant to babies with mothers who did not use the medicine. This type of study compares large groups of pregnant mothers and babies to look for medicine effects. A woman and her doctor can use registry results to make more informed choices about using medicine while pregnant.''If you are pregnant and are using a medicine or were using one when you got pregnant, check to see if there is a pregnancy exposure registry for that medicine.

What is the lactose tolerance test?,"'The lactose tolerance test is a test for diagnosing an intolerance of ingested lactose. ''Lactose intolerance'' is a genetic condition in which individuals are unable to digest and absorb the lactose ''sugar'"" in cow's milk. "" "
What is lactose intolerance?,"'Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest the ''sugar'' in milk, lactose. Milk is an important source of ''nutrition'' for children and even some adults. With normal lactose tolerance, all of the lactose is broken down (digested) in the intestine by an enzyme into two smaller sugars (galactose and glucose) which then are absorbed into the body. As a result, normally no lactose reaches the colon. ''On the other hand, in individuals with lactose intolerance who lack the intestinal enzyme that breaks down the lactose, the ingested lactose is neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine and reaches the colon where it is used by the bacteria in the colon. The bacteria produce chemicals that cause ''diarrhea'', and also produce ''gas''. ''Abdominal pain'' also may occur. ' "
How is the lactose tolerance test done?,"'The lactose tolerance test requires an individual to drink a liquid that contains lactose. In the small intestine among lactose tolerant individuals, the ingested lactose is split into galactose and glucose which then are absorbed from the intestine and go into the blood. Several blood samples are taken over a two hour period following the ingestion of the lactose to measure the blood glucose level. If lactose tolerance is normal, the glucose level in the blood rises due to the absorption of glucose from the intestine. If there is lactose intolerance, the glucose level does not rise.' "
What other tests can detect lactose intolerance?,"""Many clinicians simply make this diagnosis based on improvement of symptoms when lactose is withheld from the patient's ""'diet'' and affravation when it is re-introduced. Other tests used to detect lactose intolerance include the lactose ''hydrogen breath test'' and ''stool acidity test'', the latter is primarily used in infants and very young children. There also is a genetic test which can determine whether an individual has or does not have the intestinal enzyme that is required for the ''digestion'' and absorption of lactose.' "
What is cholesterol?,"'Cholesterol is a naturally occurring fat that the body needs to produce important structures and chemicals. It is one of the main components of cell membranes, the outer lining that protects the internal structures that make body cells work and function properly. Cholesterol is also a building block for many of the hormones in the body including mineralocorticoids that control ''electrolyte'' levels in the body, glucocorticoids involved in carbohydrate ''metabolism'', and sex hormones including testosterone, ''estrogen'', and ''progesterone''. Cholesterol is one of the building blocks that assists in forming ''vitamin D'' in the body. ''Vitamin D'' is responsible for calcium ''metabolism'' in the body.''There are two important types of cholesterol, ''high density lipoprotein (HDL)'' and ''low density lipoprotein (LDL)''. LDL is the bad cholesterol that deposits in arteries when too much is present. HDL is considered the good cholesterol because it can bind to ''LDL cholesterol'' and return it to the ''liver'' where it can be removed from the body. ''While most of the cholesterol in the body is obtained through the foods we eat, it is also produced in the ''liver'"" to meet the body's demands. The body attempts to regulate the amount of total cholesterol, but when too much cholesterol is present, the excess can be deposited in arteries throughout the body. This leads to artery narrowing and increases the risk of ""'heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral vascular disease''. Elevated LDL levels increase the risk of these diseases, and elevated HDL levels decrease the risk.' "
What does a cholesterol test measure?,"'Cholesterol tests are blood tests that measure the amount of cholesterol in the body. The health-care professional may order only a cholesterol test with results showing:''In addition to cholesterol level, the health-care professional also may order a ''lipid profile'' test. \xa0The ''lipid'' profile test will also measure ''triglyceride levels'' and another fatty substance found in the blood.'   The total cholesterol, HDL, and LDL levels."
How do I prepare for a cholesterol test?,"'For the best and most accurate results, it is important to fast for many hours before the cholesterol blood test is taken. Each laboratory has its own guidelines for not eating, and the fast may range from 9-16 hours. It is acceptable to drink water.' "
Do I need to call my doctor for my test results?,"'It usually takes a day or two from the time the blood is drawn until your health-care professional receives the results of the cholesterol test. Ideally, the health-care professional will contact you with those results and explain their significance. However, if you have not been contacted in a short period of time, it is reasonable to contact your health-care professional and ask for the test results.''There are home cholesterol test kits available that have been U.S. FDA approved, but their accuracy is not necessarily as good as that of a certified laboratory. These tests usually measure total cholesterol only, but some also can measure HDL, LDL and cholesterol. If you use one of the home kits, it is wise to discuss the results with your health-care professional.''The purpose of the cholesterol blood test is to determine whether treatment is needed for ''high cholesterol''. That treatment may include dietary and lifestyle modifications, medications, or both to control ''cholesterol levels'' and decrease the risk of ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and peripheral ''vascular disease''. ' "
How do I interpret my cholesterol test results?,"'Cholesterol levels'' are but one of the risk factors for ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral vascular disease''. It is important to control cholesterol levels to minimize risk just as it is important to control ''diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'', and avoid ''smoking''.''Guidelines for cholesterol levels have been developed by many health organizations including the American ''Heart'' Association. It is important to remember that tests may need to be repeated over time to help monitor treatment and disease risk ''prevention''.\xa0' "
What is esophageal pH monitoring?,'Esophageal pH (pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution) monitoring is a procedure for measuring the reflux (regurgitation or backwash) of acid from the stomach into the ''esophagus'' that occurs in ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'').' 
When is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is used to diagnose ''GERD'', to determine the effectiveness of medications that are given to prevent ''acid reflux'', and to determine if episodes of acidic reflux are causing episodes of ''chest pain''. Monitoring esophageal pH also can be used to determine if acid is reaching the pharynx (lower throat) and is possibly responsible for such symptoms as ''cough'', ''hoarseness'', and ''sore throat''.'  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring performed?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is performed by passing a thin ''plastic'' catheter a sixteenth of an inch in diameter through one nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus as the patient swallows. The tip of the catheter contains a sensor that senses acid. The sensor is positioned in the esophagus so that it is just above the lower esophageal sphincter, a specialized area of esophageal muscle that lies at the junction of the esophagus and stomach and prevents acid from refluxing back up into the esophagus. In this position the sensor records each reflux of acid. The catheter protruding from the nose is connected to a recorder that registers each reflux of acid. ''The patient is sent home with the catheter and recorder in place and returns the next day to have them removed. During the 24 hours that the catheter is in place, the patient goes about his or her usual activities, for example, eating, sleeping, and working. Meals, periods of ''sleep'', and symptoms are recorded by the patient in a diary and/or by pushing buttons on the recorder.  After the catheter is removed, the recorder is attached to a computer so that the data it has gathered can be downloaded into the computer where it is analyzed and put into graphic form. The procedure can be modified by placing the sensor in the upper esophagus or pharynx to determine if refluxed acid is reaching the pharynx.''The most recently-developed device for monitoring esophageal pH uses a capsule also known as the Bravo Capsule. The capsule contains an acid sensing probe, a battery, and a transmitter. The probe monitors the acid in the esophagus and transmits the information to a recorder that is worn by the patient on a belt. The capsule is introduced into the esophagus on a catheter through the nose or mouth and is attached to the lining of the esophagus with a clip. The catheter then is detached from the capsule and removed. Thus, there is no catheter protruding from the nose. The capsule transmits for two days or three days, and then the battery dies. Five to seven days later, the capsule falls off the esophageal lining and is passed in the ''stool'' as the capsule is not reusable. ''The advantages of the capsule device are related to the absence of a catheter connecting the probe to the recorder.  There is greater comfort without a catheter in the back of the throat, and patients are more likely to go to work and do more of their normal activities without feeling self-conscious about the appearance of the catheter to others. The disadvantages of the capsule are that it cannot be used in the pharynx (where it would be impossibly uncomfortable) and, so far, it has not been used in the stomach. '  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Almost everyone has some acidic reflux, but the amount of reflux is small and rarely causes inflammation of the esophagus (''esophagitis''). As the amount of acid reflux increases above the normal range, so does the probability of developing esophagitis and its symptoms. In patients with symptoms that suggest acid reflux, a diagnosis of reflux can be made by demonstrating an acid pH in the esophagus for a greater than normal amount of time.'""A common alternative method to diagnose reflux is to treat patients with medications that reduce reflux. If the patient's symptoms stop, then the symptoms are likely to be due to acid reflux. Another way of diagnosing acid reflux as the cause of symptoms is to demonstrate that episodes of acid reflux recorded by esophageal pH monitoring occur at exactly the same time as esophageal ""'pain''.''Esophageal pH monitoring also can be used to determine why treatment for reflux is not working. For example, a patient treated for acidic reflux may continue to have symptoms. If so, then the question must be asked as to why the symptoms are continuing. Is it because the medication is not adequate or is it because the symptoms are not due to reflux and, therefore, are not going to respond to treatment for reflux? If the pH monitoring study performed while the patient takes his or her medication for reflux shows abnormal amounts of reflux, then treatment is inadequate and needs to be changed. If the amount of acid reflux is within the normal range, then it is likely that the symptoms are not being caused by acid reflux, and other potential problems need to be considered as the cause of the symptoms.' "
What are the limitations of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'The demonstration of abnormal amounts of acid reflux does not mean that symptoms are being caused by the reflux.  Only treatment with medications that treat reflux coupled with a marked reduction of symptoms can be used to substantiate reflux as the cause of the symptoms.  Nevertheless, it is important to remember that treatment is associated with a placebo response. For instance, 10% to 20% of patients without acid reflux report an improvement in  symptoms with anti-reflux medications.  Therefore, even a good response to treatment does not definitely prove that reflux is the cause of symptoms.''Some of the strongest evidence that episodic ''chest pain'' is being caused by acid reflux is provided by demonstrating that the painful episodes coincides with an episode of acid reflux.  If there are very frequent episodes of reflux, however, it may not be possible to separate a true association between a symptom and reflux from a chance association due to the great frequency of episodes of reflux.  Conversely, if a symptom occurs infrequently, for example, once every few days, it is unlikely that the symptom will occur during a routine 24 hour monitoring session, and therefore, a correlation will not be possible.  One attempt to get around the latter problem is to extend the monitoring to several days, but this extended monitoring is done infrequently.' "
Are there other ways in which pH monitoring can be used?,"'If the pH sensor is left in the stomach instead of the esophagus, it is possible to determine the effectiveness of medications that shut off the production of acid in the stomach.  This information may be useful in determining the proper doses of medications among patients with acid-related conditions of the stomach and duodenum (for example, peptic ulcers).  It also is possible to place a catheter with two acid sensors so that one sensor is in the stomach and the other is in the lower esophagus.  With this catheter, it is possible to evaluate both acidic ''esophageal reflux'' and the effectiveness of acid-suppressing medications.''The pH sensor may be placed in the upper esophagus or in the pharynx just above the upper esophageal sphincter in patients with unexplained symptoms of ''sore throat'', ''hoarseness'', or ''cough''.  In these patients, the demonstration of acid reflux into the upper esophagus or pharynx suggests that acid reflux may be the cause of the symptoms. Recent studies however have shown that the association of these symptoms with acidic reflux may not be reliable.' "
What are the side effects of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'There are very few side effects of esophageal pH monitoring. Although there may be mild discomfort in the back of the throat while the catheter is in place, particularly during swallows, the majority of patients have no difficulty eating, sleeping, or going about their daily activities. Most patients, however, prefer not to go to work because they feel self-conscious about the catheter protruding from their nose. The capsule device may cause discomfort when swallowing. The discomfort is felt in the chest and may be due to food or the wave of esophageal contraction tugging on the capsule as it passes.' "
Are there alternatives to esophageal pH monitoring?,"'There are no alternatives for obtaining the information that esophageal pH monitoring provides.  Nevertheless, the presence of esophagitis visually at the time of ''endoscopy'"" strongly suggests the presence of acidic reflux among patients who don't have other likely causes of esophageal ""'pain''.  This may obviate the need to do a pH monitoring study.' "
What is ferritin?,'Ferritin is the major iron storage protein of the body. Ferritin levels can be used to indirectly measure how much iron is in the body. Ferritin has the shape of a hollow sphere that permits the entry of a variable amount of iron for storage (as ferric hydroxide phosphate complexes).' 
What is the ferritin blood test?,"""The ferritin test uses venous blood to measure ferritin levels. The test is sometimes ordered together with other tests to help evaluate the body's iron stores, such as an iron level or a total iron binding capacity (TIBC) test."" "
How does one prepare for a ferritin blood test?,'The ferritin test uses venous blood that is withdrawn as for any routine blood test. No special preparation for the test is necessary. Fasting is not necessary.' 
How is the test performed?,"'A needle attached to a vacuum collection device is inserted into a vein, often a vein in the antecubital fossa (crease of the elbow), after the area has been cleaned. Venous blood can also be taken from other sites.' "
What are the potential side effects of a ferritin blood test?,'The ferritin blood test is a routine blood test and typically does not cause side effects. Mild ''bruising'' at the venipuncture site can occur infrequently.' 
What are normal results for a ferritin test?,"'The results may vary slightly among laboratories, but in general, normal ferritin levels range from 12 to 300 nanograms per milliliter of blood (ng/mL) for males and 12 to 150 ng/mL for females.' "
What does an elevated ferritin level mean?,"'Higher-than-normal levels of ferritin can be indicative of an iron storage disorder such as ''hemochromatosis''.''Hereditary ''hemochromatosis'' is an ''inherited'' (genetic) disorder in which there is excessive accumulation of iron in the body (''iron overload''). In individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, the daily absorption of iron from the ''intestines'' is greater than the amount needed to replace losses. Since the normal body cannot increase iron excretion, the absorbed iron accumulates in the body.''People with hereditary hemochromatosis may have no symptoms or signs (and have normal longevity), or they can have severe symptoms and signs of ''iron overload'' that include:''The symptoms arise because iron accumulates in the organs and leads to destruction and loss of normal function.''Other causes of a high ferritin level are chronic inflammatory medical conditions such as ''liver disease'' or ''rheumatoid arthritis'', or some types of ''cancer''.'   A man with hemochromatosis can accumulate 20 grams of total body iron by age 40 to 50 (the normal iron content for the body is 3 to 4 grams). The excess iron deposits in the joints, liver, testicles, and heart, which causes damage to these organs, and causes signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis. Women with hemochromatosis accumulate iron at a slower rate than men because they lose more iron than men due to iron loss from menstruation. Therefore, they typically develop signs and symptoms of organ damage due to excess iron 10 years later than men. sexual dysfunction, heart failure, joint pains, liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, weight loss, fatigue, and darkening of skin."
What does a low ferritin level mean?,"'Lower-than-normal serum ferritin levels are seen in ''iron deficiency''. Without enough iron, the body cannot produce sufficient levels of ''hemoglobin'', a component of ''red blood cells'' that allows them to carry oxygen. ''Iron deficiency anemia'' is the result. Mild ''anemia'' may not produce symptoms at all. More serious cases of ''iron deficiency anemia'' can produce symptoms such as:' shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, feeling lightheaded, pale skin, and fast heartbeat."
What is esophageal pH monitoring?,'Esophageal pH (pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution) monitoring is a procedure for measuring the reflux (regurgitation or backwash) of acid from the stomach into the ''esophagus'' that occurs in ''gastroesophageal reflux disease'' (''GERD'').' 
When is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is used to diagnose ''GERD'', to determine the effectiveness of medications that are given to prevent ''acid reflux'', and to determine if episodes of acidic reflux are causing episodes of ''chest pain''. Monitoring esophageal pH also can be used to determine if acid is reaching the pharynx (lower throat) and is possibly responsible for such symptoms as ''cough'', ''hoarseness'', and ''sore throat''.'  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring performed?,"'Esophageal pH monitoring is performed by passing a thin ''plastic'' catheter a sixteenth of an inch in diameter through one nostril, down the back of the throat, and into the esophagus as the patient swallows. The tip of the catheter contains a sensor that senses acid. The sensor is positioned in the esophagus so that it is just above the lower esophageal sphincter, a specialized area of esophageal muscle that lies at the junction of the esophagus and stomach and prevents acid from refluxing back up into the esophagus. In this position the sensor records each reflux of acid. The catheter protruding from the nose is connected to a recorder that registers each reflux of acid. ''The patient is sent home with the catheter and recorder in place and returns the next day to have them removed. During the 24 hours that the catheter is in place, the patient goes about his or her usual activities, for example, eating, sleeping, and working. Meals, periods of ''sleep'', and symptoms are recorded by the patient in a diary and/or by pushing buttons on the recorder.  After the catheter is removed, the recorder is attached to a computer so that the data it has gathered can be downloaded into the computer where it is analyzed and put into graphic form. The procedure can be modified by placing the sensor in the upper esophagus or pharynx to determine if refluxed acid is reaching the pharynx.''The most recently-developed device for monitoring esophageal pH uses a capsule also known as the Bravo Capsule. The capsule contains an acid sensing probe, a battery, and a transmitter. The probe monitors the acid in the esophagus and transmits the information to a recorder that is worn by the patient on a belt. The capsule is introduced into the esophagus on a catheter through the nose or mouth and is attached to the lining of the esophagus with a clip. The catheter then is detached from the capsule and removed. Thus, there is no catheter protruding from the nose. The capsule transmits for two days or three days, and then the battery dies. Five to seven days later, the capsule falls off the esophageal lining and is passed in the ''stool'' as the capsule is not reusable. ''The advantages of the capsule device are related to the absence of a catheter connecting the probe to the recorder.  There is greater comfort without a catheter in the back of the throat, and patients are more likely to go to work and do more of their normal activities without feeling self-conscious about the appearance of the catheter to others. The disadvantages of the capsule are that it cannot be used in the pharynx (where it would be impossibly uncomfortable) and, so far, it has not been used in the stomach. '  "
How is esophageal pH monitoring used?,"'Almost everyone has some acidic reflux, but the amount of reflux is small and rarely causes inflammation of the esophagus (''esophagitis''). As the amount of acid reflux increases above the normal range, so does the probability of developing esophagitis and its symptoms. In patients with symptoms that suggest acid reflux, a diagnosis of reflux can be made by demonstrating an acid pH in the esophagus for a greater than normal amount of time.'""A common alternative method to diagnose reflux is to treat patients with medications that reduce reflux. If the patient's symptoms stop, then the symptoms are likely to be due to acid reflux. Another way of diagnosing acid reflux as the cause of symptoms is to demonstrate that episodes of acid reflux recorded by esophageal pH monitoring occur at exactly the same time as esophageal ""'pain''.''Esophageal pH monitoring also can be used to determine why treatment for reflux is not working. For example, a patient treated for acidic reflux may continue to have symptoms. If so, then the question must be asked as to why the symptoms are continuing. Is it because the medication is not adequate or is it because the symptoms are not due to reflux and, therefore, are not going to respond to treatment for reflux? If the pH monitoring study performed while the patient takes his or her medication for reflux shows abnormal amounts of reflux, then treatment is inadequate and needs to be changed. If the amount of acid reflux is within the normal range, then it is likely that the symptoms are not being caused by acid reflux, and other potential problems need to be considered as the cause of the symptoms.' "
What are the limitations of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'The demonstration of abnormal amounts of acid reflux does not mean that symptoms are being caused by the reflux.  Only treatment with medications that treat reflux coupled with a marked reduction of symptoms can be used to substantiate reflux as the cause of the symptoms.  Nevertheless, it is important to remember that treatment is associated with a placebo response. For instance, 10% to 20% of patients without acid reflux report an improvement in  symptoms with anti-reflux medications.  Therefore, even a good response to treatment does not definitely prove that reflux is the cause of symptoms.''Some of the strongest evidence that episodic ''chest pain'' is being caused by acid reflux is provided by demonstrating that the painful episodes coincides with an episode of acid reflux.  If there are very frequent episodes of reflux, however, it may not be possible to separate a true association between a symptom and reflux from a chance association due to the great frequency of episodes of reflux.  Conversely, if a symptom occurs infrequently, for example, once every few days, it is unlikely that the symptom will occur during a routine 24 hour monitoring session, and therefore, a correlation will not be possible.  One attempt to get around the latter problem is to extend the monitoring to several days, but this extended monitoring is done infrequently.' "
Are there other ways in which pH monitoring can be used?,"'If the pH sensor is left in the stomach instead of the esophagus, it is possible to determine the effectiveness of medications that shut off the production of acid in the stomach.  This information may be useful in determining the proper doses of medications among patients with acid-related conditions of the stomach and duodenum (for example, peptic ulcers).  It also is possible to place a catheter with two acid sensors so that one sensor is in the stomach and the other is in the lower esophagus.  With this catheter, it is possible to evaluate both acidic ''esophageal reflux'' and the effectiveness of acid-suppressing medications.''The pH sensor may be placed in the upper esophagus or in the pharynx just above the upper esophageal sphincter in patients with unexplained symptoms of ''sore throat'', ''hoarseness'', or ''cough''.  In these patients, the demonstration of acid reflux into the upper esophagus or pharynx suggests that acid reflux may be the cause of the symptoms. Recent studies however have shown that the association of these symptoms with acidic reflux may not be reliable.' "
What are the side effects of esophageal pH monitoring?,"'There are very few side effects of esophageal pH monitoring. Although there may be mild discomfort in the back of the throat while the catheter is in place, particularly during swallows, the majority of patients have no difficulty eating, sleeping, or going about their daily activities. Most patients, however, prefer not to go to work because they feel self-conscious about the catheter protruding from their nose. The capsule device may cause discomfort when swallowing. The discomfort is felt in the chest and may be due to food or the wave of esophageal contraction tugging on the capsule as it passes.' "
Are there alternatives to esophageal pH monitoring?,"'There are no alternatives for obtaining the information that esophageal pH monitoring provides.  Nevertheless, the presence of esophagitis visually at the time of ''endoscopy'"" strongly suggests the presence of acidic reflux among patients who don't have other likely causes of esophageal ""'pain''.

What is the definition of homocysteine? What is it?,"'Homocysteine is an amino acid produced by the body by chemically altering adenosine. Amino acids are naturally made products, which are the building blocks of all the proteins in the body. Most labs report normal ranges of homocysteine as about 4-15 µml/L.''Homocystinuria was discovered in 1962 by two different groups of researchers. In 1969, Dr. Kilmer S. McCully reported that children born with a ''genetic disorder'' called homocystinuria, which causes the homocysteine levels to be very high, sometimes died at a very young age with advanced ''atherosclerosis'' in their arteries. Homocysteine levels in the blood may be elevated for many reasons. More specifically, these reasons can be divided into severe genetic causes and other milder causes.' "
What are hyperhomycysteinemia and homocystinuria? Are they inherited (genetic)?,"'Homocystinuria was discovered in 1962 by two different groups of researchers. In 1969, Dr. Kilmer S.

Homocysteine levels in the blood may be elevated for many reasons. More specifically, these reasons can be divided into severe genetic causes and other milder causes.' "
"How many people have elevated homocysteine levels, and who gets the condition?","'Mild elevation in homocysteine levels (hyperhomocysteinemia) are common, and seen in about 5% to 12% of the general population. In specific populations such as, alcoholics (due to poor vitamin intake) or patients with chronic ''kidney disease'', this may be more common. The severe genetic form, homocystinuria, is rare (0.02%).'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of homocystinuria?,"'Homocystinuria has a constellation of signs and symptoms that include:'  Developmental delay Osteoporosis (thin bones) Visual abnormalities Formation of blood clots Advanced atherosclerosis or narrowing and hardening of blood vessels, a type of heart disease."
What are the more common causes of hyperhomocysteinemia?,"'More common causes of elevated homocysteine levels in the blood are milder genetic variations of homocystinuria. In these conditions, the mediator molecules malfunction and are less efficient because of a minor abnormality in their structure. They also lead to elevation of homocysteine levels (above 15 µmol/L), although much milder than in homocystinuria (above 100 µmol/L), by slowing down the breakdown of homocysteine.' "
How can homocysteine levels be lowered?,"'Eating cereals that are fortified with ''folic acid'', and to a lesser extent ''vitamins'' B6 and B12, can lower blood homocysteine levels. These ''supplements'' may even be beneficial in people with mild genetic hyperhomocysteinemia to lower their homocysteine levels. However, it is noteworthy that so far there is no compelling data to support the treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia for ''prevention'' of ''heart disease'' or treatment of known ''heart disease'' or blood clots. Homocysteine levels are not routinely measured in people with ''heart'' disease (atherosclerosis) or other diseases.'  "
Who should get tested for elevated homocysteine levels? How is it treated?,"'Currently, there are no official recommendations as to who should undergo testing for homocysteine blood levels. Before data that are more scientific become available from the currently ongoing studies, many experts do not recommend a screening test for blood homocysteine levels, even in patients with unexplained ''blood clot'' formation. In addition, the consensus recommendation is against treating elevated homocysteine levels with ''vitamins'' to prevent heart disease. Rarely, a few specialists may test for elevated homocysteine levels in patients with early onset of ''blood clot'' formation, ''heart attacks'', ''strokes'', or other symptoms related to atherosclerosis, especially if these patients do not have typical risk factors, such as ''smoking'' cigarettes, ''diabetes'', ''high blood pressure'', or high LDL ''cholesterol levels'' and they suspect genetic causes''There is also no consensus as to the optimal dose of folic acid and other B vitamins for the treatment of elevated blood homocysteine levels. (For example, treatment of patients with high homocysteine levels may require higher doses of folic acid and other B vitamins than the amounts contained in a multivitamin.) Therefore, a decision regarding testing should be individualized after consulting with your doctor and/or a specialist in genetic diseases. Some researchers recommend treatment guidelines that result in levels of homocysteine below 100 µmol/L but say the recommendation may change (possibly lowered) with new data.'  "
Does lowering homocysteine level prevent heart attacks and strokes?,"'Currently, there is no direct proof that taking folic acid and B vitamins to lower homocysteine levels prevents ''heart attacks'' and strokes. However, in a large population study involving women, those who had the highest consumption of folic acid (usually in the form of ''multivitamins'') had fewer ''heart attacks'' than those who consumed the least amount of folic acid. In this study, the association between dietary intake of folate and vitamin B6 and risk of heart disease was more noticeable than between dietary intake of vitamin B12 and heart disease, which was minimal.''Many other observational studies have been performed to assess the effect of folate and the other B vitamins on heart disease. Most of these studies have concluded that oral intake of folate has been associated to lower risk of heart disease, possibly because due to lowering of homocysteine levels. The relation between oral intake of vitamin B12 and B6 and heart disease was not as obvious in many of these studies. In one study, it was concluded that even in people with elevated homocysteine levels due to genetic reasons, oral intake of folate and possibly the other B vitamins was related to lower incidence of heart disease.''Most of these data, however, are obtained from observational studies rather than purely controlled scientific data. Therefore, it is important to mention that despite these studies suggesting an association between the intake of these vitamins and the lower incidence of heart disease, in general, there is no compelling clinical evidence to treat hyperhomocysteinemia other than homocystinuria (the severe genetic form) in regards to heart disease, ''stroke'', or blood clots. Homocysteine levels are not routinely measured in people with these problems.' "

Cervista HPV Test Facts," A subgroup of the human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are known to cause cancers of the uterine cervix and other genital areas, the so-called ""high risk"" HPVs. The Cervista test is used to diagnose the presence of DNA from the ""high-risk"" HPVs in cervical samples. The sample for the test is taken in the same way that a Pap smear test is performed. There are two Cervista tests available, Cervista HPV 16/18, which identified the two HPV types most likely to cause cancer, and Cervista HPV HR, which identifies all ""high-risk"" HPV types. Cervista testing is not recommended for routine screening; rather, it is used in combination with physical examination, medical history, and other testing to help make decisions about management and follow-up on a case-by-case basis."
What is human papillomavirus (HPV)?,"'Of the more than 100 types of papillomaviruses (HPVs) that infect humans, more than 40 types can infect the anogenital tract (genital tract and anus) of men and women and cause ''genital warts'' (known as condylomata acuminata or venereal ''warts''). A subgroup of the HPVs that infect the anogenital tract can lead to ''precancerous'' changes in the uterine cervix and cause ''cervical cancer'' or other genital cancers in women. The HPV types that cause ''cervical cancer'' also have been linked with both anal and ''penile cancer'' in men.''The most common HPV types that infect the anogenital tract are HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18), although other HPV types can also infect the anogenital tract. Among these, HPV-6 and HPV-11 are most commonly associated with benign lesions such as ''genital warts'' and mild dysplasia of the cervix (potentially ''precancerous'' changes in the appearance of cervical cells under a microscope) and are termed ""low-risk"" HPV types. In contrast, HPV-16 and HPV-18 are the types found in the majority of cervical and anogenital cancers as well as severe dysplasia of the cervix. These belong to the so-called ""high-risk"" group of HPVs. Twelve other HPV types have also been identified as causes of cervical and other genital cancers, although these are less common that HPV-16 and -18.''HPV infections are transmitted primarily by sexual intimacy, and the risk of infection increases as the number of sexual partners increase.' "
What is the Cervista HPV test?,"'The Cervista HPV test, manufactured by Hologic, is a test that is used to identify the presence of ''human papillomavirus'' (HPV) genetic material, or DNA, in cervical samples, such as samples taken during Pap screening or ''colposcopy''. The Cervista test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March of 2009 and was the first DNA test approved by the FDA for detection of HPV in women.''Two different tests are available, known as Cervista HPV 16/18 and Cervista HPV HR. Cervista HPV 16/18 is used to diagnose the presence of DNA from the two most common HPV types associated with ''cancer'', HPV 16 and 18, while Cervista HPV HR is used to diagnose all 14 ""high risk"" or ''cancer'""-associated HPV types. The choice for which test to use depends on what information the patient's physician wants to collect."" "
How is the HPV test done?,"'For the Cervista test, a sample is taken from the cervix in the same way that a sample for Pap testing is obtained. It can be performed at the same time as Pap testing or ''colposcopy''. There is no special preparation needed for the test, although women should try to schedule Cervista and other screening tests about two weeks after their ''last menstrual period'' and try to avoid having the test performed during the ''menstrual period''. Results are typically ready in about the same time as normal Pap screening results.' "
Who should be tested for HPV?,"'The Cervista test is not used for routine screening of all women and is not intended to be a stand-alone test. It is not recommended for testing in women under 30 years of age who have normal cytology (Pap) results. Cervista is designed for use in women age 30 and older or women with unclear or borderline Pap screening results, such as ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of unknown significance) or low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). It can provide more information about the risk of ''cervical cancer'' for women who may have precancerous changes of the cervix. ''According to the manufacturer, the Cervista test ""should be used in conjunction with clinical information derived from other diagnostic and screening tests, physical examinations, and full medical history in accordance with appropriate patient management procedures.""' "
How are the results of an HPV test interpreted?,"'A positive test result does not mean that a woman will definitely get ''cervical cancer''.'""The results of the test are used to help estimate a woman's risk of developing cervical ""'cancer'' or to estimate the severity or risk of findings that may not be clear from physical examination and Pap screening. As discussed previously, the results of the Cervista HPV test are not interpreted alone but in combination with Pap testing, medical history, and physical examination. The test gives one more piece of information to help the health care practitioner make the best decisions about further monitoring and management for each woman on a case-by-case basis.'  "
Facts you should know about Pap smears,"  A Pap smear is a simple, quick, and essentially painless screening test (procedure) for cancer or precancer of the uterine cervix. Cells collected from a woman's cervix during a pelvic exam are spread on a microscope slide for examination. The cells are evaluated for abnormalities, specifically for pre- cancerous and cancerous changes. A woman may experience a small amount of spotting (light vaginal bleeding) immediately after a Pap smear, but heavy or excessive bleeding is not normal. Cervical cancer screening is recommended every 3 years for women aged 21-65. The Pap smear is analyzed according to a uniform standardized system known as the Bethesda System. An abnormal Pap smear may show precancerous changes that can be treated at an early stage, before cancer develops. A recording of the woman's menstruation status and whether and when she had abnormal Pap smears previously is essential to the reader of the current Pap smear. Up to 80% of women diagnosed with invasive cancer of the cervix have not had a Pap smear in the past 5 years. Cancer of the cervix is largely a preventable disease."
What is a Pap smear procedure?,"'A Pap smear (Papanicolau smear; also known as the Pap test) is a screening test for ''cervical cancer'"". The test itself involves collection of a sample of cells from a woman's cervix (the end of the uterus that extends into the vagina) during a routine pelvic exam. The cells are placed on a glass slide and stained with a substance known as Papanicolau stain. The stained cells are then examined under a microscope to look for pre-""'malignant'' (before-cancer) or malignant (cancer) changes.''A Pap smear is a simple, quick, and relatively painless screening test. Its ''specificity'','' ''which means its ability to avoid classifying a normal smear as abnormal (a ""false positive"" result), while very good, is not perfect. The ''sensitivity'' of a Pap smear, which means its ability to detect every single abnormality, while good, also is not perfect, and some ""false negative"" results (in which abnormalities are present but not detected by the test) will occur. Thus, a few women develop ''cervical cancer'' despite having regular Pap screening.''In the vast majority of cases, a Pap test does identify minor cellular abnormalities before they have had a chance to become malignant, and at a point when the condition is most easily treatable. The Pap smear is not intended to detect other forms of cancer such as those of the ovary, vagina, or uterus. Cancer of these organs may be discovered during the course of the gynecologic (pelvic) exam, which usually is done at the same time as the Pap smear.' "
Who should have a Pap smear?,"'Guidelines have been developed for cervical cancer screening that address the frequency with which women should have Pap smears. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) both recommend that all women receive cervical cancer screening every 3 years between the ages of 21 and 65. A Pap smear is the typical screening procedure, but when a Pap smear is combined with a test for ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV'', the known cause of cervical ''cancers''), screening every 5 years is acceptable for women aged 30 and above.''Pregnancy'' does not prevent a woman from having a Pap smear, therefore, Pap smears can be safely done during pregnancy.''Pap smear testing is not indicated for women who have had a ''hysterectomy'' (with removal of the cervix) for benign conditions. Women who have had a hysterectomy in which the cervix is not removed, called subtotal hysterectomy, should continue screening following the same guidelines as women who have not had a hysterectomy.'  "
What are the risks of having a Pap smear?,"'There are absolutely no known medical risks associated with Pap smear screening. (However, there are medical risks from not having a Pap smear.) A woman may experience a small amount of spotting (light ''vaginal bleeding'') immediately after a Pap smear, but heavy or excessive bleeding is not normal.' "
What kind of doctor performs a Pap test?,"'Pap testing is performed by obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs) or by primary care physicians including family practitioners, internal medicine specialists, or pediatricians. Pap smears can also be performed by other specially trained health-care professionals including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or nurse midwives.' "
How do medical professionals perform a Pap smear?,"""With the woman positioned on her back, the health-care professional will often first examine the outside of the patient's genital and rectal areas, including the urethra (the opening where urine leaves the body), to assure that they look normal.""'A bimanual (both hands) pelvic exam usually follows the collection of the two samples for the Pap smear. The bimanual examination involves the physician or health-care professional inserting two fingers of one hand inside the vaginal canal while feeling the ovaries and uterus with the other hand on top of the abdomen (belly).' A speculum is then inserted into the vaginal area (the birth canal). (A speculum is an instrument that allows the vagina and the cervix to be viewed and examined.) A small brush or swab is inserted into the opening of the cervix and twirled around to collect a sample of cells. A second sample is also collected on the surface of the cervix as part of the Pap smear The samples are placed in a solution from which cells are isolated and used to produce slides for laboratory evaluation."
How will I find out the results of my Pap smear?,"""The results of the Pap smear are usually available within one to two weeks. At the end of Pap smear testing, each woman should ask how she should expect to be informed about the results of her Pap smear. If a woman has not learned of her results after a month, she should contact her health-care professional's office."" "
What is an abnormal Pap smear?,"'An abnormal Pap smear shows cancer or precancerous changes in the cells of the cervix. It is especially important to identify abnormal cells in the early stages, because treatment can be carried out to remove the abnormal cells. The section below entitled ""How is a Pap smear read and analyzed"" contains the specific terminology used in the report for an abnormal Pap smear. '  "
How do medical professionals analyze a Pap smear?,"'Pap smear analysis and reports are all based on a medical terminology system called The Bethesda System. The system was developed (at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland) to encourage all medical professionals analyzing Pap smears to use the same reporting system. Standardization reduces the possibility that different laboratories might report different results for the same smear.''The Bethesda System was the outcome of a National Cancer Institute workshop that was held in 1988 in an effort to standardize Pap smear reports. In 2001, the guidelines were revised and improved. Acceptance of the Bethesda reporting system in the United States is virtually universal.''The major categories for abnormal Pap smears reported in the Bethesda Systems are as follows (described in further detail in the ""What are the possible recommendations for follow-up after a Pap smear?"" section):''The word ""''squamous''"" describes the thin, flat cells that lie on the surface of the cervix. ""Intraepithelial"" indicates that the surface layer of cells is affected. A ""lesion"" means that abnormal tissue is present.''An abnormal or inadequate Pap smear report may contain the following diagnoses.''There is a particular area inside the opening of the cervix where the cells lining the vagina change to the cells that characterize the inside of the cervix (endocervical cells). This is called the ""transition zone"". The Pap smear sample from the cervical opening attempts to sample these cells. However, this area may be so far up inside the cervix that the Pap smear sampling instrument simply cannot reach that high. Sometimes, the transition zone may be less accessible to the Pap brush or the cervical opening cannot be seen well enough to obtain an adequate sample.'""If severe inflammation is present, its cause(s) are investigated. The physician's goals are to identify the cause of inflammation and to treat and resolve the condition, if possible. Untreated inflammation can have consequences for the woman as well as her sexual partner(s).""'The vaginal irritation may be caused by a lack of estrogen, such as occurs after ''menopause'' when the ovaries stop producing this hormone. This lack of estrogen tends to make the vaginal walls irritated and red. If a woman has this condition and it is related to an estrogen deficiency (called ""atrophic ''vaginitis''"" and usually described on the Pap smear report as ""atrophic changes""), her physician may recommend a trial of topical (locally- applied) vaginal estrogen (cream, vaginal estrogen tablets, vaginal estrogen ring) to heal the inflammation. The Pap smear is then repeated.''Sometimes, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (also called ""ASC-US""), is the Pap report. This is the mildest form of cellular abnormality on the spectrum of cells ranging from normal to cancerous. ASC-US means that the cells appear ''abnormal, but are not malignant''.''""Of undetermined significance"" means that the atypical-appearing cells may be the end result of a number of different types of injuries to the cervix. For example, the human papilloma virus (''HPV'') could be the cause of ASC-US. Most instances of ASC-US (80%-90%) resolve spontaneously (by themselves without specific medical intervention or treatment).''A reading of LSIL is a ''reason for immediate further investigation'' because it is more abnormal than ASC-US. Fifteen to 30% of women who have this abnormality on Pap testing will have a more serious abnormality on biopsy of the cervix. Thus, all women with LSIL are recommended to undergo ''colposcopy'' (an examination of the cervix using a special visualizing scope, often accompanied by a ''cervical biopsy'', see below). Even LSIL spontaneously returns to normal without therapy in many women within several months.''The most severe cellular abnormality that is ''not actually cancer'' is high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). A finding of HSIL unquestionably requires prompt evaluation and treatment.' ASC-US: This abbreviation stands for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. LSIL: This abbreviation stands for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Under the old system of classification, this category was called CIN grade I. HSIL: This abbreviation stands for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Under the old system of classification, this category was called CIN grade II, CIN grade III, or CIS. ASC-H: This means atypical cells are present and HSIL cannot be excluded."
What information is included on a Pap smear report?,"'The first items on a Pap smear report are for purposes of identification. The report is expected to have the name of the woman, the name of the pathologist and/or the cytotechnologist who read the smear, the source of the specimen (in this case, the cervix), and the date of the ''last menstrual period'' of the woman.''The Pap smear report should also include the following:' A description of the woman's menstrual status (for example, ""menopausal"" (no longer menstruating) or ""regular menstrual periods"") The woman's relevant medical history (example, ""history of genital warts"")  The number of slides (either one or two, depending on the health care 
professional's routine practice)  A description of the specimen adequacy (whether the sample is satisfactory for interpretation) The final diagnosis (for example, ""within normal limits"")  The recommendation for follow-up (for example, ""recommend routine follow-up"" or ""recommend repeat smear"")"
Why is a woman's menstrual status important for the Pap smear?,"""A woman who is menstruating sheds cells from the lining of her uterus called endometrial cells. If these cells are seen on the Pap smear of a menstruating woman, the report may note that these cells are present. This is normal if the Pap test was done around the time of the woman's ""'menstrual period''. The comment that these cells are ""cytologically benign"" means that they do not appear to be malignant (cancerous) cells.''However, if a woman is menopausal (no longer menstruating) she would not be expected to be shedding cells from the uterine lining. Therefore, endometrial cells on a Pap report might be indicative of an abnormal thickening of the ''endometrium'', the lining of the uterus. The Pap smear is not specifically designed to detect such an abnormality. Nonetheless, if these cells are noted in a non-menstruating woman, her doctor should attempt to determine the cause of the shedding of the endometrial cells.''Sometimes, the cause is endometrial hyperplasia, a precancerous condition of the uterine lining, which can be detected by a relatively simple office procedure called an ''endometrial biopsy''. Sometimes, menopausal ''hormone therapy'"" can cause shedding of endometrial cells that appear on a Pap smear. The pattern of bleeding, the exact type of hormone therapy, and the individual woman's health history are the three components that guide the physician to know whether and what type of further evaluation is necessary."" "
What are risk factors for cervical cancer and precancer?,"'A number of risk factors have been identified for the development of cervical cancer and precancerous changes in the cervix.' HPV: The principal risk factor is infection with the genital wart virus, also called the human papillomavirus (HPV), although most women with HPV infection do not get cervical cancer. Almost all cervical cancers are related to HPV infection. Some women are more likely to have abnormal Pap smears than other women. Smoking: One common risk factor for premalignant and malignant changes in the cervix is smoking. Although smoking is associated with many different cancers, many women do not realize that smoking is strongly linked to cervical cancer. Smoking increases the risk of cervical cancer about two to four fold. Weakened immune system: Women whose immune systems are weakened or have become weakened by medications (for example, those taken after an organ transplant) also have a higher risk of precancerous changes in the cervix. Medications: Women whose mothers took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy also are at increased risk. Other risk factors: Other risk factors for precancerous changes in the 
	cervix, having an abnormal Pap test, having multiple sexual partners, and becoming sexually active at a young age."
Why is a woman's past Pap smear history pertinent?,"'If a woman has had a history of a cellular abnormality on a previous Pap smear, it is important for her to inform the health-care professional performing the current Pap smear. The woman should provide the details of any previous problems and treatments so that this information can be noted on the lab form. The past history of the woman helps the person who is reading (interpreting) the current Pap smear, because a particular abnormality on previous screening alerts the health-care professional to look more carefully for specific findings on the current Pap smear.' "
When might a Pap smear not be adequate for interpretation?,"'It is a requirement that the report comment on the adequacy of the smear sample for Pap analysis. If the sample is inadequate, the report details the reason. Examples of problems that might be listed under ""sample adequacy"" include ""drying artifact"" or ""excessive blood."" These comments refer to factors that the person analyzing the smear feels may have interfered with his or her ability to interpret the sample.''Sometimes, a Pap smear report will read ""unsatisfactory due to excessive inflammation."" Inflammation that is present in the woman\'s cervical area may make it difficult to interpret the Pap smear. Examples of causes of ''inflammation'' might include infections or irritation. Inflammation is a common finding on pap smears. If it is severe, your doctor may want to try to determine the cause of the inflammation. In many cases, a repeat pap smear is recommended to determine if the inflammation has resolved and to obtain a sample that is adequate for interpretation.' "
How do medical professionals make a final Pap smear diagnosis?,"'The final Pap smear diagnosis is based on three determining factors:''The final diagnosis is a short statement that summarizes what the reader has found.'  The patient's history: The reader (the person reading the smear) takes into account the woman's history as noted on the lab request by the clinician performing the smear. Sample adequacy: The reader then decides whether the sample was adequate for interpretation. The presence or absence of cellular abnormalities: The reader then notes whether cellular abnormalities were seen on the slides. If the appearance of the Pap smear does not seem to coincide with the woman's clinical history, a comment may also be made to that effect."
What are the possible recommendations for follow-up after a Pap smear?,"'Once the final diagnosis has been made, the follow-up recommendation informs you what the appropriate next step(s) might be. For example, if the final diagnosis states that the smear was ""within normal limits,"" the appropriate follow-up might be ""recommend routine follow-up.""''An abnormal Pap smear is one in which the laboratory interprets the cellular changes to be different from those normally seen on a healthy cervix. There are a number of possible follow-up scenarios for an abnormal Pap smear.' "
What treatments are available if a Pap smear is abnormal?,"'If a Pap smear is interpreted as abnormal, there are a number of different management and treatment options including colposcopy, conization, cryocauterization, laser therapy, and large-loop excision of the transformation zone.''All of these procedures have essentially the same overall cure rate of over 90%. However, the procedures do vary considerably in a number of other respects and so will be discussed separately.''Colposcopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to take a closer look at the cervix. The colposcope is essentially a magnifying glass for the cervix. For colposcopy to be adequate, the whole cervical lesion, as well as the whole transformation zone (the transition between the vagina-like lining and the uterus-like lining), must be seen.''During colposcopy, the cervix is cleaned and soaked with 3% acetic acid (vinegar). This mild acid not only cleans the surface of the cervix but it also allows cellular abnormalities to show up as white areas (called acetowhite epithelium or acetowhite lesions).''If suspicious areas of cervical tissue are seen during colposcopy, a biopsy (tissue sampling) is often done. The sample is sent to the laboratory for analysis by a pathologist, and the biopsy results determine the next step in the treatment.''The procedure is essentially painless and quite simple, usually taking only several minutes to perform. Generally, the woman is instructed not to have intercourse, ''douche'', or use tampons for about a week afterwards if a biopsy is done. Pregnancy is not a contraindication to colposcopy. Colposcopy can adequately evaluate 90% of women who have abnormal Pap smear results.''Conization allows the entire area of abnormal tissue to be removed and provides the maximum amount of cervical tissue for laboratory evaluation to rule out the presence of invasive cancer. After the cervical area is visualized, generally by colposcopy, a small cone-shaped specimen of tissue is taken from around the endocervical canal.''Conization is usually done on an out-patient basis under anesthesia in a hospital or surgical facility. For three weeks after the procedure, the woman needs to avoid ''douching'', and using tampons and refrain from sexual intercourse.''Cure rates close to 100% are achieved with conization as long as the cells along the margins of treatment are normal.''With conization, there are associated risks from anesthesia and postoperative hemorrhage (bleeding-in about 10% of cases) as well as possible future adverse effects on ''fertility''. Conization is generally performed only on women who have had severe changes on biopsy, have ''adenocarcinoma'' in situ (a diagnosis of cancer in the inner portion of the cervix), or whose Pap smears suggest they may have some invasion of cancer into the nearby tissue.''Large-loop excision of the transformation zone (''LEEP'') removes the cervical transformation zone (the area where the vaginal-type lining changes to the uterine-type lining) using a thin-wire loop to administer electrocautery. It allows samples to be collected for additional tissue analysis and can be performed in the office under local anesthesia.''Specialized (more frequent) follow-up is necessary after LEEP. This follow-up includes Pap smears, colposcopy, and sometimes other techniques. This is now the most commonly used treatment for Pap smear abnormalities.''A hysterectomy for the treatment of abnormal Pap smears is appropriate only for those women who are finished with childbearing and have severe pre-cancerous abnormalities that have persisted despite other treatments.' "
What is the current status of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing?,"'HPV is a sexually transmitted virus that may be spread from one person to another even when the genital sores are not visible. Many sexually active people are carriers of HPV, very often without even knowing they are carriers. It is estimated that up to 60% of sexually active women harbor this virus on their cervix or in their vaginal area. It is not unusual for a woman to be unaware that she has HPV - only to find out that her Pap smear shows evidence of HPV.''HPV is not curable, although the cellular damage it causes is generally treatable and ''vaccines'' against the most commonly found HPV types are available.''The main use of HPV testing in screening for cervical cancer is for determination of treatment and follow-up recommendations for women with Pap smears interpreted as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US).' "
"With Pap smears so available, why are women still dying of cervical cancer?","'It is critically important to recognize that the women who are at highest risk for abnormal Pap smear testing are those who are not getting regular Pap testing. Therefore, it follows that in order to improve overall cervical cancer screening, women who are not getting regular Pap smears should be educated about and offered Pap testing. These under-served women should be the most heavily targeted for Pap screening.''Between 60% and 80% of American women who are newly diagnosed with ''invasive cervical cancer'' have not had a Pap smear in the past five years and may never have had one. Women who have not had Pap smear screening tend to be concentrated in certain population groups including:''Many doctors feel that the emphasis should be on universal access to proper Pap screening as opposed to the comparatively small benefit that would come from utilizing the newer technologies in women already undergoing screening. Cervical cancer is one of the most common ''causes of cancer'' worldwide. It is also one of the most preventable and treatable cancers.' Older women;  
 The uninsured;   
 Ethnic minorities, especially Latino, African American, and Asian American women;   
 Poor women; and   
 Women in rural areas."
What should you know about quad marker screening?,"'The quad marker screening test (quad screen) is a blood test administered in ''pregnancy'', typically between the 15th and 20th weeks of gestation. Similar to the triple screen, the quad marker screen provides information about whether there is an increased risk for certain ''birth defects'' in the baby.''The test is simple and involves taking a blood sample as for any other routine blood test. The quad marker test is a screening test, meaning that it gives information about risk, but it does not allow the definitive diagnosis of any conditions. It can only signal that further testing should be done to confirm a diagnosis. There is no risk to the baby from the test.'  "
Why did my doctor order a quad marker screening test?,"'The quad screen looks at the three substances also measured in the triple screen (alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and estriol) test plus one additional substance, inhibin A.'""Looking at levels of these four substances in the mother's bloodstream allows an estimation of risk for ""'neural tube defects'' and certain chromosomal abnormalities, like ''Down syndrome''.' Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is produced by the liver of the fetus Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone made by the placenta Estriol is an estrogen made both by the placenta and the liver of the fetus Inhibin-A is another hormone made by the placenta"
How accurate is the quad marker screening test?,"""The test is a screening test only, and is not 100% accurate. It can predict about 85% of open neural tube defects, problems with the development of the baby's brain and spinal cord. It predicts about 80% of fetuses with ""'Down syndrome'' in women over age 35 and about 75% \xa0in younger women. The fact that it is not 100% accurate means that not all women who have a positive high risk result on the quad screen will have a fetus with a birth defect, and the test may also be normal even in the presence of birth defects.''For example, about 50 women out of every 1,000 will have a result on the quad screen that indicates an increased risk of a birth defect, but only one to two of those women will actually have a baby with an open neural tube defect. About 40 women out of 1,000 will have a result indicating an increased risk of Down syndrome, but only one to two of these women will have a baby with Down syndrome.' "
What should you do if you have normal or abnormal tests results?,"""As with any screening test, an abnormal result does not mean that the fetus definitely has a birth defect or genetic condition. It only means that the blood levels of these four substances suggest that a woman's risk is increased of having a baby with certain conditions. Women who have a result suggesting increased risk are typically offered further testing. This can include repeating the quad screen and/or having a high definition ""'ultrasound'' examination to look for signs of birth defects or abnormalities in the developing baby. If this testing is abnormal, the mother may be offered the choice to undergo ''amniocentesis''. Amniocentesis involves withdrawing a sample of ''amniotic fluid'' for genetic and chromosome testing, and it can definitively establish the diagnosis of genetic and chromosomal problems in most fetuses. Amniocentesis carries a small risk of ''miscarriage'' (fewer than 1% of fetuses tested).' "
LDL and HDL: What are triglycerides?,"'Triglycerides are chemical compounds digested by the body to provide it with the energy for metabolism. Triglycerides are the most common form of fat in the body. They are the main ingredient in vegetable oils and animal fats.''The triglyceride molecule is a form of the chemical glycerol (tri=three molecules of fatty acid + glyceride=glycerol) that contains three fatty acids. To be absorbed, these parts are broken apart in the small intestine, and afterwards are reassembled with ''cholesterol'' to form chylomicrons. This is the source of energy for cells in the body. Fat cells and ''liver'' cells are used as storage sites and release chylomicrons when the body needs the energy.''Elevated triglyceride levels are a risk factor for atherosclerosis, the narrowing of arteries with the buildup of fatty plaques that may lead to ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral artery disease''. Markedly elevated triglyceride levels may also cause fatty ''liver disease'' and pancreatitis.''Certain diseases and conditions may cause elevated triglyceride blood levels, for example:''Alcohol'' consumption can raise triglyceride blood levels by causing the liver to produce more fatty acids. However, there are some beneficial aspects of moderate alcohol consumption, defined as one alcoholic beverage per day (a glass of wine, a bottle of beer, or an ounce of hard liquor), that may balance this triglyceride rise. Moderate alcohol consumption may mildly increase ''HDL'' (the good cholesterol) levels in the bloodstream and red wine, which contains antioxidants, may decrease the risk of ''heart disease''. ''However, it is not recommended that people start to drink alcohol to obtain these effects.' Poorly-controlled diabetes Kidney disease Cirrhosis of the liver or other liver diseases Hypothyroidism Some medications (for example, beta blockers, diuretics, birth control pills)"
How are triglyceride levels measured?,"'Triglyceride levels in the blood are measured by a simple blood test. Often, triglycerides are measured as part of a lipoprotein panel (''lipid'' panel) in which triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein), and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) are measured at the same time.''Fasting for 8-12 hours before the test is required. Fat levels in the blood are affected by recent eating and ''digestion''. Falsely elevated results may occur if the blood test is done just after eating.' "
What are normal triglyceride levels? What do elevated triglyceride levels mean?,'Elevated triglycerides place an individual at risk for atherosclerosis. Triglyceride and ''cholesterol levels'' are measured in the blood to provide a method of screening for this risk.' Normal triglyceride levels in the blood are less than 150mg per deciliter (mg/dL). Borderline levels are between 150-200 mg/dL. High levels of triglycerides (greater than 200 mg/dl) are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and therefore coronary artery disease and stroke. Extremely high triglyceride levels (greater than 500mg/dl) may cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
What causes low triglyceride levels?,"'Returning triglyceride levels to normal may decrease the risk of ''heart'' attack, ''stroke'', and peripheral artery disease. Controlling high triglycerides and ''high cholesterol'' is a lifelong challenge. A healthy lifestyle includes eating well, exercising routinely, ''smoking cessation'', and ''weight loss''. This may be all that is needed, but some people additionally require medications to lower triglyceride levels in the blood. Your health-care professional will help make decisions with you to decide what treatment combination is most appropriate.' "
Changes in diet to lower triglycerides,"'The following dietary changes may be helpful in lowering triglycerides.''Switch to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats instead of trans or saturated fats. The best sources of these fats are olive oil, canola oil, nuts, and fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, lake trout, sardines, herring, and albacore tuna. Learning to interpret food labels will help you understand the kinds of fat in the food you buy and consume.'   Decreasing your intake of sugar: If you have a sweet tooth, try to set limits on how often and how much sugar you consume. You can cut your intake in half to begin with, and continue cutting back from there. Remember to read the labels to check for sugar content in both food and beverages. Changing from white to brown: If you eat white rice, bread, and pasta, switch to whole wheat products. It may take a little while to get used to the difference in taste, but it's worth the effort for the benefits to your health. A variety of whole-wheat products are available so experiment until you find the one that you like best. Switching fats: Limit or avoid foods with saturated and trans fats. These include fried foods, lard, butter, whole milk, ice cream, commercial baked goods, meats, and cheese. Read the nutrition labels to determine whether these unhealthy fats are present."
What is testicular cancer?,"'Testicular cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of one or both testicles.''The testicles are 2 egg-shaped glands located inside the scrotum (a sac of loose skin that lies directly below the penis). The testicles are held within the scrotum by the spermatic cord, which also contains the vas deferens and vessels and nerves of the testicles.''The testicles are the male sex glands and produce testosterone and sperm. Germ cells within the testicles produce immature sperm that travel through a network of tubules (tiny tubes) and larger tubes into the epididymis (a long coiled tube next to the testicles) where the sperm mature and are stored.''Almost all testicular cancers start in the germ cells. The two main types of testicular germ cell tumors are seminomas and nonseminomas. These 2 types grow and spread differently and are treated differently. Nonseminomas tend to grow and spread more quickly than seminomas. Seminomas are more sensitive to radiation. A testicular tumor that contains both seminoma and nonseminoma cells is treated as a nonseminoma.''Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men 20 to 35 years old.' "
Health history can affect the risk of testicular cancer.,"""Anything that increases the chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for testicular cancer include:"" 

Read Doctor's View
   Having had an undescended testicle. Having had abnormal development of the testicles. Having a personal history of testicular cancer. Having a family history of testicular cancer (especially in a father or brother). Being white."
Signs and symptoms of testicular cancer include swelling or discomfort in the scrotum.,'These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by testicular cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:' A painless lump or swelling in either testicle. A change in how the testicle feels. A dull ache in the lower abdomen or the groin. A sudden build-up of fluid in the scrotum. Pain or discomfort in a testicle or in the scrotum
Tests that examine the testicles and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose testicular cancer.,"'The following tests and procedures may be used:' Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. The testicles will be examined to check for lumps, swelling, or pain. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. Serum tumor marker test: A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The following tumor markers are used to detect testicular cancer:Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG).Tumor marker levels are measured before inguinal orchiectomy and biopsy, to help diagnose testicular cancer. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG). Inguinal orchiectomy: A procedure to remove the entire testicle through an incision in the groin. A tissue sample from the testicle is then viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells. (The surgeon does not cut through the scrotum into the testicle to remove a sample of tissue for biopsy, because if cancer is present, this procedure could cause it to spread into the scrotum and lymph nodes. It's important to choose a surgeon who has experience with this kind of surgery.) If cancer is found, the cell type (seminoma or nonseminoma) is determined in order to help plan treatment."
"After testicular cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body.","'The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.''The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:''Tumor marker levels are measured again, after inguinal orchiectomy and biopsy, in order to determine the stage of the cancer. This helps to show if all of the cancer has been removed or if more treatment is needed. Tumor marker levels are also measured during follow-up as a way of checking if the cancer has come back.''Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:''When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called ''metastasis''. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the ''primary tumor'') and travel through the lymph system or blood.''The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if testicular cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually testicular cancer cells. The disease is metastatic testicular cancer, not ''lung cancer''.' Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Abdominal lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes in the abdomen are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy. For patients with nonseminoma, removing the lymph nodes may help stop the spread of disease. Cancer cells in the lymph nodes of seminoma patients can be treated with radiation therapy. Serum tumor marker test: A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The following 3 tumor markers are used in staging testicular cancer:Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG).Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body."
The following stages are used for testicular cancer:,"'In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the tiny tubules where the sperm cells begin to develop. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. All tumor marker levels are normal. Stage 0 is also called testicular intraepithelial neoplasia and testicular intratubular germ cell neoplasia.''In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IS and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.''Stage II is divided into stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage IIC and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.''Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.''or''Cancer:''Tumor marker levels may range from normal to high.' In stage IA, cancer is in the testicle and epididymis and may have spread to the inner layer of the membrane surrounding the testicle. All tumor marker levels are normal.

What is recurrent testicular cancer?,"'Recurrent testicular cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back many years after the initial cancer, in the other testicle or in other parts of the body.' "
There are different types of treatment for patients with testicular cancer.,"'Different types of treatments are available for patients with testicular cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.''Testicular tumors are divided into 3 groups, based on how well the tumors are expected to respond to treatment.''For nonseminoma, all of the following must be true:''For seminoma, all of the following must be true:''For nonseminoma, all of the following must be true:''For seminoma, all of the following must be true:''For nonseminoma, at least one of the following must be true:''There is no poor prognosis grouping for seminoma testicular tumors.'   The tumor is found only in the testicle or in the retroperitoneum (area outside or behind the abdominal wall); and The tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and The levels of all the tumor markers are slightly above normal. The tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and The level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is normal. Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be at any level. The tumor is found in one testicle only or in the retroperitoneum (area outside or behind the abdominal wall); and The tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and The level of any one of the tumor markers is more than slightly above normal. The tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; and The level of AFP is normal. β-hCG and LDH may be at any level. The tumor is in the center of the chest between the lungs; or The tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; or The level of any one of the tumor markers is high."
Five types of standard treatment are used:,"'Surgery to remove the testicle (inguinal orchiectomy) and some of the lymph nodes may be done at diagnosis and staging. Tumors that have spread to other places in the body may be partly or entirely removed by surgery.''Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.''Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:''The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat testicular cancer.''Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses ''drugs'' to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body ''cavity'' such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.'""Surveillance is closely following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. It is used to find early signs that the cancer has recurred (come back). In surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests on a regular schedule.""'High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. ''Stem cells'"" (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells."" External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer."
Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.,"'For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.'""Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.""'Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.''Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.''Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.' "
Follow-up tests may be needed.,"'Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.''Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.''Men who have had testicular cancer have an increased risk of developing cancer in the other testicle. A patient is advised to regularly check the other testicle and report any unusual symptoms to a doctor right away.''Long-term clinical exams are very important. The patient will probably have check-ups frequently during the first year after surgery and less often after that.' "
Treatment Options by Stage,"'Treatment of stage 0 may include the following:''Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.''Treatment of stage I testicular cancer depends on whether the cancer is a seminoma or a nonseminoma.''Treatment of seminoma may include the following:''Treatment of nonseminoma may include the following:''Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.''Treatment of stage II testicular cancer depends on whether the cancer is a seminoma or a nonseminoma.''Treatment of seminoma may include the following:''Treatment of nonseminoma may include the following:''Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.''Treatment of stage III testicular cancer depends on whether the cancer is a seminoma or a nonseminoma.''Treatment of seminoma may include the following:''Treatment of nonseminoma may include the following:''Talk with your doctor about clinical trials that may be right for you.'

Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.,"'The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:''Testicular cancer can usually be cured in patients who receive ''adjuvant chemotherapy'' or radiation therapy after their primary treatment.''Certain treatments for testicular cancer can cause infertility that may be permanent. Patients who may wish to have children should consider sperm banking before having treatment. Sperm banking is the process of freezing sperm and storing it for later use.' Stage of the cancer (whether it is in or near the testicle or has spread to other places in the body, and blood levels of AFP, β-hCG, and LDH). Type of cancer. Size of the tumor. Number and size of retroperitoneal lymph nodes."
What are the testicles? What do they look like (pictures)?,"'The testicles form part of the male reproductive organs, with a primary function of producing sperm and the male hormone testosterone.' Testicles are contained within an external sac-like structure called the scrotum, which is located between the penis and the anus. Adult testicles are about the size two large olives. It is common for one testicle to hang lower than the other within the scrotum. Located near the back of each testicle lies the epididymis, which is a coiled tubular structure that functions to store and transport sperm. A tubular structure containing blood vessels, nerves, lymphatic vessels and the vas deferens called the spermatic cord courses from the abdomen and is connected to each testicle. Apart from containing vital structures for each testicle, the spermatic cord also suspends the testicles within the scrotum."
What does testicular pain feel like? How severe is the pain?,"'Testicular pain is pain or discomfort that is felt in one or both testicles. The pain may originate from the testicle itself, or it may be the result of other conditions affecting the scrotum, groin, or abdomen. Though there are numerous medical conditions that can cause testicular pain, it is important to understand that a few of them constitute medical emergencies that require immediate medical attention in order to prevent impairment or loss of testicular function. Testicular pain can be an acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) condition. The testicular pain may be constant or intermittent.' "
What causes testicular pain? What are other symptoms of pain in the testicles?,"'Many diseases and other health problems can cause pain in one or both testicles. Testicular pain along with other symptoms and signs vary depending on the underlying cause. However, often times the symptoms can be very similar between the various causes, making it difficult to distinguish among the conditions which require urgent medical attention. ''Therefore, if you experience testicular pain, call your doctor immediately or go to the nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department. '  "
"Testicular torsion causes, symptoms, and signs","'Testicular torsion typically occurs because of an anomaly affecting the normal attachment of the testicle within the scrotum, often referred to as the ""bell clapper"" deformity. This abnormality allows the testicle to be freely suspended and twist spontaneously. Often times, this anomaly is present in both testicles. Trauma to the testicle is a rare cause of testicular torsion.''Testicular torsion is most common in males younger than 30 years of age, with a peak incidence between 12 to 18 years of age. It can also occur more frequently during the ''neonatal'' period. Testicular torsion most often affects the left testicle, and it is the most common cause of testicle loss in adolescent males.''Testicular torsion generally comes on suddenly. Severe testicle pain that is only felt in one testicle may also have these signs and symptoms:' Nausea and vomiting Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness Testicular and/or scrotal swelling and redness Abdominal pain Fever Elevation of the affected testicle within the scrotum Horizontal positioning of the affected testicle within the scrotum Loss of the cremasteric reflex on the affected side (normally, the testicle elevates with light stroking of the upper inner thigh area)."
"Epididymitis causes, symptoms, and signs","'Epididymitis occurs when there is inflammation of the epididymis (a structure within the scrotum). Generally, the condition is result of an infection. Epididymitis primarily affects adult men, and is most common between the ages of 19 to 40 years; however, it can occur in prepubescent boys and elderly men.''Sexually transmitted diseases or ''STDs'' that are most commonly caused by the bacteria ''Chlamydia trachomatis'' and ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' are the most common cause of epididymitis in sexually active men. In younger and older males, the infection usually is caused by bacteria such as ''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli'') that are found in the urinary tract. Infection in these age groups is typically the result of an abnormality within the genitourinary system.''Epididymitis comes on gradually. The testicular pain can be mild, moderate, or severe, and only in one testicle. Epididymitis also may have symptoms and signs including:' Nausea and vomiting Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, typically localized to the area of the epididymis, though it can become more generalized and involve the whole testicle as the illness progresses Testicular and/or scrotal swelling and redness Abdominal pain Fever Urethral discharge Urinary symptoms, such as burning, urgency, or frequency"
"Inguinal hernia causes, symptoms, and signs","'An ''inguinal hernia'' is a bulge or protrusion of intestine through a defect in the abdominal wall musculature of the groin area. This protrusion can sometimes cause ''swelling of the scrotum'' and subsequent testicular pain.''Inguinal hernias are common and they can sometimes cause discomfort in the scrotum and/or testicles. Signs and symptoms of an inguinal ''hernia'' may include a:' Bulge in the scrotum or in the inguinal area, that may become more pronounced with coughing or straining; and Dull ache or burning sensation in the scrotum and/or testicles."
"Testicular tumor causes, symptoms, and signs","""Generally, testicular tumors don't cause pain; however, occasionally some tumors can cause pain and discomfort of the testicle or scrotum. Signs and symptoms of a tumor in a testicle may include a:"" Lump or mass of the testicle Change in the size or texture of the testicle Dull ache of the lower abdomen, lower back or groin area Feeling of heaviness in the scrotum"
"Orchitis causes, symptoms, and signs","'Orchitis is a sign of inflammation of a testicle, usually because of an infection, for example, the mumps, the most common cause of the condition. Usually, mumps orchitis occurs in males who have not reached ''puberty''; however, there has been an increase in cases in boys who have gone through puberty and adolescent males, secondary to the decreased use of the mumps ''vaccine''. Rarely, orchitis can be caused by a bacterial infection that, usually, is the result of progression of epididymitis (epididymo-orchitis).''Because orchitis generally occurs as a consequence of an infection (most often mumps), it is typically also accompanied by other systemic infectious symptoms. Testicular pain may range from mild to severe. Signs and symptoms of orchitis may include:' Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, swelling or redness Fever and chills Headache Body aches Nausea Fatigue Parotid gland inflammation (parotitis) in cases of mumps"
"Trauma and injury causes, symptoms, and signs","'Trauma or injury of any type to the testicles can cause severe pain and discomfort. Blunt testicular trauma (around 85%) is the most common cause of testicle pain. Examples of causes of injuries to the testicle include sports injuries, a direct kick to the groin or testicle, car accidents, and straddle injuries. Usually, the pain improves with time. Rarely, trauma to the testicles can cause more severe injuries requiring immediate medical attention.''The testicular pain may range from severe to absent at the time the person sees a doctor. Rarely however, the injury may seem minor, but there may be a serious underlying injury to the testicle.''Other symptoms and signs of trauma or injury to a testicle include:' Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, swelling or bruising Bruising of the area between the scrotum and the anus (perineum) Nausea and vomiting"
"Testicle rupture causes, symptoms, and signs","'Testicle rupture is a serious injury that is a result of a disruption to the connective tissue enveloping the testicle (tunica albuginea), which then causes extrusion of testicular tissue. Often, a sign of testicular rupture is a blood collection (hematocele) that surrounds the testicle.''Other types of injuries that cause testicular rupture include penetrating trauma and testicular dislocation. These types of testicular injuries typically require surgery.' "
"Torsion of a testicular appendage cause, symptoms, and signs","'Torsion of a testicular appendage occurs due to twisting (torsion) of the testicular or epididymal appendage, which are functionless structures that are remnants of tissue from human development. The testicular appendage lies between the testicle and the epididymis, while the epididymal appendage typically projects from the epididymis. As with testicular torsion, twisting of these structures leads to a decrease in blood flow and subsequent testicular pain. This is a common condition in younger boys, with most cases occurring between 7 to 14 years of age. Though this condition is benign and self-limiting, it must be distinguished from the more serious testicular torsion.''With torsion of a testicular appendage, the onset of testicle pain may be sudden or gradual, and the severity of pain may range from mild to severe. Generally, a person has no symptoms or signs like nausea, vomiting, and fever.''The testicle and/or scrotum generally appear normal, without swelling and redness; however, other symptoms and signs may include:''Preservation of the normal vertical positioning of the affected testicle within the scrotum, and preservation of the cremasteric reflex is generally maintained.' Testicular tenderness, typically only localized to the top of the right or left testicle. Sometimes, a small blue-dot is visualized near the top of the affected testicle (blue-dot sign)."
Can kidney stones cause testicular pain and other symptoms and signs?,"'Occasionally, the pain associated with kidney stones can radiate into the groin area and cause testicular pain. However, the testicles appear normal with no swelling or redness. Other signs and symptoms of kidney stones may include:' Back (flank) pain and tenderness Abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Urinary symptoms, such as blood in the urine, discomfort with urination and urinary frequency"
How are the causes of testicular pain diagnosed?,"""In order to diagnose the underlying condition causing testicular pain, a health care professional will perform a complete history and physical exam. Laboratory testing and imaging studies may also be ordered depending on the health care professional's initial impression and evaluation.""'Laboratory testing may include:''Imaging studies may be ordered by your health care professional to further delineate the underlying cause of the testicular pain. In certain patients with testicular pain whose symptoms are strongly suggestive of testicular torsion, immediate urologic consultation prior to testing should be obtained in order to prevent potential delays in definitive surgical management.''A color Doppler testicular ''ultrasound'' is a noninvasive imaging study that can evaluate the blood flow to the testicles, as well as the presence of testicular tumors, fluid collections, testicular rupture, and hernias. A kidney ultrasound can be helpful in the evaluation of kidney stones.''This is an imaging study requiring the intravenous administration of a radionuclide, useful for the evaluation of testicular torsion, as well as other causes of testicular pain. It is used much less commonly than ultrasound.''CT scan'' or a kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) X-ray ''These particular imaging studies are sometimes ordered if there is a suspicion that the testicular pain is being caused by kidney stones or other conditions in the abdomen or pelvis.' Blood work Urinalysis A swab of the urethra (if the patient has penile discharge suggestive of a sexually transmitted disease)"
What is the treatment for testicular pain?,"'The treatment for testicular pain varies depending on the underlying cause. As already noted, some conditions causing testicular pain are medical emergencies requiring immediate surgical intervention.''The treatment of uncomplicated epididymitis can generally be managed as an outpatient, and consists of the following treatment measures:''In general, acute epididymitis that is properly treated resolves without complications. However, in some cases of epididymitis, such as those associated with serious systemic symptoms or in those accompanied by various complications, hospitalization may be necessary. A urologist will be consulted in these more serious cases.''The treatment for torsion of the testicular or epididymal appendage is directed toward relief of symptoms, and consists of the following measures:''Most patients improve with these treatment measures within 1 week, though symptoms may last longer. In cases of testicular pain refractory to conservative management, surgical excision of the affected tissue is considered.''The treatment for kidney stones generally depends on the location of the ''kidney stone'', the size of the ''kidney stone'', and any associated complications, such as infection. An uncomplicated kidney stone can typically be treated with the following measures:''Several different measures exist for treating kidney stones that do not pass spontaneously, such as ''lithotripsy'' (the use of ''shock'' waves to break up the kidney stone) and other more invasive surgical procedures.''Certain patients with intractable pain, intractable vomiting or those with signs of infection require hospitalization. In those with ''urinary tract infection'' and an obstruction in the genitourinary system, antibiotics and emergent urologic intervention are necessary.''The treatment and management of testicular trauma depends on the severity of injury. Minor cases of testicular trauma without suspected serious underlying testicular injury can be managed as an outpatient with the following measures:''With testicular rupture, immediate surgical repair is necessary to preserve testicular function and viability. Other situations requiring surgical management include certain blunt trauma injuries with associated blood collections (hematoceles), penetrating trauma, and certain cases of testicular dislocation.''The treatment of orchitis depends on the infectious organism responsible for causing the testicular inflammation. Both viral and bacterial orchitis can be treated with the following measures:''Bacterial orchitis and epididymo-orchitis require antibiotics. Those cases caused by ''viruses'' do not require antibiotics.'   Definitive management of testicular torsion requires surgery by a urologist. During surgery, the affected testicle is untwisted, and if it is viable, the testicle is secured to the scrotal wall (orchiopexy). The unaffected testicle may also be secured to prevent testicular torsion from occurring, as some males will have the bell clapper abnormality on both sides. Sometimes, the affected testicle can be manually untwisted by a doctor without necessitating emergent surgery, though this is a temporizing measure that ultimately still requires definitive surgical repair. Likewise, some cases of testicular torsion can occur and then resolve spontaneously, and the health care professional must maintain a high index of suspicion in order for this condition to be diagnosed and ultimately surgically repaired. The more rapidly the testicle is untwisted and blood flow is restored, the better the chances for salvaging the affected testicle. If treated within 6 hours of symptom onset, the salvage rate nears 100%, while after 24 hours the salvage rate is between 0% and 10%. Antibiotics (which may vary depending on the patient's age and sexual history), pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs Adequate fluid intake Pain medication Anti- nausea medication In some instances medications such as tamsulosin (Flomax), which may facilitate the passage of kidney stones The treatment for a testicular tumor depends on various factors. A testicular mass is considered cancer until proven otherwise. If testicular cancer is diagnosed, patients are referred to an oncologist who will discuss the different treatment options available. Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs The definitive treatment of inguinal hernias requires surgical repair, sometimes electively as an outpatient, while others require intervention on a more emergent basis. Occasionally, inguinal hernias may not be repaired even electively because a patient is too high-risk to undergo surgery. Prompt surgical intervention is necessary in cases of inguinal hernias that are not reducible (unable to be pushed back into the abdomen) and in those cases of strangulation (disruption to the blood supply of the intestine). Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs"
What are the complications of causes of testicular pain?,"'The complications associated with the different causes of testicular pain are varied. Some individuals may suffer from chronic testicular pain, even after the acute cause of the testicular pain has been treated. Other potential complications may include:'   Permanent damage to the testicle Loss of testicle Infertility Infection Cosmetic deformity Epididymitis complications Epididymo-orchitis Abscess (a collection of pus) formation Impaired fertility Systemic blood infection (sepsis) There are no significant complications for torsion of a testicular appendage. Permanent damage to the testicle Atrophy (decrease in size) of the testicle Loss of testicle Infertility Abscess formation Cosmetic deformity Testicular torsion Incarceration (hernia unable to be pushed back in) Strangulation (disruption to the blood supply of the intestine protruding through the abdominal wall defect) Atrophy of the testicle Impaired fertility Abscess formation Permanent kidney damage Urosepsis (systemic blood infection arising from infected urine) The complications of a testicular tumor vary depending on the underlying type of tumor and the extent of disease."
How can testicular pain be prevented?,"'There are a few measures that you can take to prevent certain causes of testicular pain. However, many of the causes are not entirely preventable.' For epididymitis or bacterial orchitis caused by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), condom use can reduce the risk of transmission of STDs. The use of appropriate protective gear during sporting activities can help prevent testicular trauma. Mumps immunization can decrease the incidence of viral orchitis."
What is the  definition of low testosterone (low-T)?,"'The low limit of testosterone levels in men is about 300 nanograms per deciliter and the upper normal limit is approximately 1000-1200 ng/dl. A low level needs to be investigated further to distinguish it from normal ''aging''.'   Testosterone is a hormone required for male development and sexual function and is produced primarily in the testicles. Testosterone is responsible for building muscle and bone mass, sperm production, and sex drive. Testosterone influences male pattern fat distribution, bone density, and red blood cell production. In the normal developing male, testosterone peaks during early adulthood. Once you reach age 30, testosterone levels slowly decline by approximately 1% a year. This is a normal part of aging."
What is low testosterone (low-T)?," Low testosterone (low-T) is underproduction or lack of production of testosterone in men and women. Causes of low-T include chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, infections, obesity, or other hormonal conditions. Symptoms of low-T include:Change in sleep patternsReduced sex drive (low libido)Sexual dysfunctionInfertilityEmotional changesDecreased strengthWeight gain Change in sleep patterns Reduced sex drive (low libido) Sexual dysfunction Infertility Emotional changes Decreased strength Weight gain Low-T testing includes linking symptoms with testosterone blood levels. Treatment options for low-T include different forms of testosterone replacement therapy."
What causes low testosterone (low-T)?,"'Some of the conditions that can lead to a low level are:'   Obesity Diabetes (type 2) Chronic medical conditions (especially liver or kidney disease) Hormonal disorders Infections Medications (narcotics, chemotherapy)"
What are low testosterone (low-T) symptoms and signs?,"'It is important to distinguish between a normal decline of testosterone levels and hypogonadism.''Signs and symptoms of ''low testosterone'' include:''Although testosterone therapy helps with hypogonadism, whether it helps in the reversal or slowing of normal effects of ''aging'' and lower testosterone levels is unclear. Several published research articles have conflicting results and more research is needed to make a final determination about the use of testosterone for healthy ''aging'' males.'

How do you know if you have low testosterone (low-T)?,"'The diagnosis of low-T is based on correlating a low blood level (300 ng/dl or below) with symptoms.''Most of the symptoms are very apparent (see previously), but some need to be further investigated (such as low ''bone density'').' "
What are the treatment options for low testosterone (low-T)?,"'Treatment of ''low testosterone'' in hypogonadism is a fully accepted therapy. Treatment in older men is more controversial. Discuss your testosterone levels, symptoms, and side effects of treatment with your doctor to establish whether you should receive therapy and what form of therapy.''There are several ways that testosterone therapy can be administered:''Why no pills? Testosterone is available as a pill but some experts believe long-term oral delivery of testosterone can have negative effects on the ''liver'"". These other delivery methods bypass the liver (as they don't involve a pill being absorbed through the stomach/intestine) and go directly into the blood stream.""   Transdermal (skin patch): Usually applied once a day (for example, Androderm). Tends to be clean and easy to apply. There is an available mouth patch that sticks to the upper gums and is applied twice daily. Gels: Applied directly to the skin and then absorbed through the skin (for example, AndroGel, and Axiron). Dosing is more difficult although these gels are available in single applications packages or premeasured pumps. Injections: Testosterone can be delivered by direct injection. Pellets: Pellets can be implanted into the soft tissue and release the testosterone."

What are the side effects of testosterone therapy?,'Possible side effects and risks of testosterone therapy for the normal aging male include:' Stimulation of growth of the prostate (benign prostatic hypertrophy) and possible growth of existing prostate cancer Skin reactions Limiting sperm production and shrinkage of testicles Overproduction of red blood cells (which can contribute to a heart attack) Some studies have implicated testosterone in an increase in cardiovascular events.
Should I take testosterone?,"'The definite verdict on testosterone therapy is still out. Testosterone therapy is accepted as a treatment for hypogonadism, a clearly defined medical condition.''In older adults who have markedly decreased testosterone levels without significant symptoms or who have modestly decreased levels with significant symptoms, testosterone therapy should be considered after a discussion with your doctor about side effects and possible positive effects of therapy.''There is no clear proof that testosterone therapy is helpful in reversing any aspects of natural aging in males.' "
Testosterone deficiency introduction,"'Testosterone is a hormone produced by the testicles and is responsible for the proper development of male sexual characteristics. Testosterone is also important for maintaining muscle bulk, adequate levels of ''red blood cells'', memory, bone growth, sense of well-being and sexual function.''Inadequate production of testosterone is not a common cause of ''erectile dysfunction''; however, when ''ED'' does occur due to decreased testosterone production, ''testosterone replacement therapy'' may improve the problem.' "
What causes testosterone deficiency?,"'As a man ages, the amount of testosterone in his body gradually declines. This natural decline starts after age 30 and continues throughout life. Other causes of lowered testosterone levels include:''The significance of age-related testosterone decline is controversial and poorly understood.' Injury, infection, or loss of the testicles. Chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer. Genetic abnormalities such as Klinefelter's Syndrome (extra X chromosome). Hemochromatosis (too much iron in the body). Dysfunction of the pituitary gland (a gland in the brain that produces many important hormones). Inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis (a condition that causes inflammation of the lungs). Medications, especially hormones used to treat prostate cancer and corticosteroid drugs. Chronic illness. Chronic kidney failure. Liver cirrhosis. Stress. Alcoholism Chronic pain and use of narcotics for pain contol. HIV and AIDS"
What are the symptoms of testosterone deficiency?,"'Without adequate testosterone a man may lose his sex drive, experience ''erectile dysfunction'', feel ''depressed'', have a decreased sense of well-being, and have ''difficulty concentrating''.' "
What changes occur in the body due to testosterone deficiency?," Decrease in muscle mass, with an increase in body fat and weight gain Changes in cholesterol levels. Decrease in hemoglobin and possibly mild anemia. Fragile bones (osteoporosis). Decrease in body hair. Changes in cholesterol levels and lipid levels."
How do I find out if I have a testosterone deficiency?,"'The only accurate way to detect the condition is to have your doctor measure the amount of testosterone in your blood. Because testosterone levels fluctuate throughout the day, several measurements will need to be taken to detect a deficiency. Doctors prefer, if possible, to test levels early in the morning since this is when testosterone levels are at their highest.' "
How is testosterone deficiency treated?,"'Testosterone deficiency can be treated by:''Each of these options provides adequate levels of hormone replacement; however, they all have different advantages and disadvantages. Talk to your doctor to see which approach may be right for you.' Intramuscular injections, generally every two or three weeks Testosterone patch worn either on the body or on the scrotum (the sac that contains the testicles) Testosterone gel Mucoadhesive material applied above the teeth twice a day Injectible pellets"
Who shouldn't take testosterone replacement therapy?,'Men who have ''prostate cancer'' or ''breast cancer'' should not take testosterone replacement therapy. All men considering testosterone replacement therapy should undergo a thorough ''prostate cancer screening'' prior to starting this therapy with a rectal exam and ''PSA test''.' 
What are the side effects of testosterone replacement therapy?,"'In general, ''hormone replacement therapy'' is safe. Possible side effects include:''Laboratory abnormalities that can occur with hormone replacement include:''If you are taking hormone replacement therapy, regular follow-up appointments with your doctor are important.''Like any other medication, directions for administering testosterone should be followed exactly as your doctor orders. If you are unsure or have any questions about testosterone replacement therapy, ask your doctor.' Acne or oily skin. Mild fluid retention. Stimulation of prostate tissue, with perhaps some increased urination symptoms such as a decreased stream or frequency. Breast enlargement. Worsening of sleep apnea (a sleep disorder that results in frequent night time awakenings and daytime sleepiness). Decreased testicular size. Changes in cholesterol and lipid levels. Increase in red blood cell count. Decrease in sperm count, producing infertility (especially in younger men). Increase in PSA"
Who should get tested?,"'The current Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) health guidelines for getting the tests done are as follows:' All individuals who exhibit the symptoms of COVID-19 must get tested after consulting their healthcare provider. Individuals who were in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case (within 6 feet of an infected person for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period) must get tested. The contact is the period considered within a period starting from two days before the illness onset (or, for asymptomatic patients, two days prior to testing specimen collection) until the time the patient is isolated. Asymptomatic screening may be mandated by a health authority if you have traveled to an area with a high prevalence of patients with COVID-19 in the last 14 days or if you are undergoing any medical procedure."
What is the difference between the types of tests available for COVID-19?,"'Getting tested for COVID-19 can identify you as a positive or negative patient of the disease. Remember no test is 100% accurate. Different methods of testing have been launched to trace COVID-19 infection. These are as follows:''It is the best test available to confirm COVID-19 infection. The test is accurate around 60-95% of the time when properly conducted.''Compared with the NAAT test, this test has low sensitivity (around 56%). This means that there is more risk of missing an actively infected person with this test.''A positive antibody testing does not mean that you are immune to COVID-19 in the future.''The following test kits are available in the market for sample collection. Most of the testing kits use the RT-PCR method to diagnose the virus.' The test to diagnose active infection:Molecular test/real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test/nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) testRapid antigen test Molecular test/real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test/nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) test Rapid antigen test Tests to diagnose the past COVID-19 infection: A level of serum IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 is measured for detecting any past infection.The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2–IgG was 30% in the first week of infection,66% in the second week, and88% in the third week. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2–IgG was 30% in the first week of infection, 66% in the second week, and 88% in the third week.

Is done through blood or finger prick. Should not be used for detecting active infection. Reports may take one to three days to come. Detects the body’s response to COVID-19 infection. Rapid, point-of-care diagnostic tests use a mucus sample from your nose or throat. This test is done at the doctor’s clinic where the sample is collected, and the results are available in minutes. These tests may be molecular- or antigen-based. Combination tests are used for the detection of flu and coronavirus at the same time. Some can test for many different types of respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Saliva tests allow a patient to spit into a tube rather than get use their nose or throat swabs. Some people may prefer the saliva test to swabs. These are also safer for healthcare workers while sampling collection. At-home collection tests, available only by prescription from a doctor, allow the patient to collect the sample from the back of the throat and send it directly to the lab"
7 Common Third trimester tests introduction,'During the last trimester of ''pregnancy'' your doctor may recommend that you have certain diagnostic tests. These tests are all safe and have been developed to ensure the optimum well-being of both mother and baby.''Listed are some of the most common tests women who are ''pregnant'' will given.' 
Group B streptococcus screening,"'Group B ''streptococcus'' (GBS) is a type of bacteria that can exist in the female reproductive tract without causing symptoms. Up to 30% of healthy women can carry ''group B strep'', and it usually does not cause problems. However, sometimes it can lead to serious infection of the bloodstream, infection of the placenta, or ''urinary tract infection''. Group B ''strep'' can also have serious consequences for the baby, causing potentially life-threatening infections in the ''newborn'', including meningitis,  ''pneumonia'', and ''sepsis''. Testing is simple and involves taking a sample from the vagina and from the rectum with a cotton swab. The swab is cultured in the laboratory to determine if group B ''strep'' is present. If the test is positive, you will be given antibiotics during ''labor'' to reduce the chances of infection in the baby. The test is usually done between the 35th and 37th weeks of pregnancy and should be done in subsequent ''pregnancies'' even if you test negative in your first pregnancy.' "
Electronic fetal heart rate monitoring,'Electronic fetal ''heart'' rate monitoring is often done to confirm that the baby is healthy. This type of monitoring is also done during  ''labor and delivery''. It can be done any time after the 20th week of gestation during ''prenatal'' checkups.' 
The nonstress test (NST),"'The nonstress test (NST) involves a fetal monitor strapped to the mother\'s abdomen to measure the baby\'s heart rate as it moves. It is called ""nonstress"" because no ''stress'' is placed on the fetus for the test. This test is sometimes performed on a weekly basis in high-risk pregnancies. It is done after the 28th week of pregnancy, though most often after 32 weeks. Measurements are typically taken for 20 to 30 minutes. A NST may be ordered if you feel the baby is not moving normally, if you are past your due date, or if your doctor wants to ensure that the placenta is healthy and functioning well. There are no known risks of the NST for the mother or the baby.' "
A biophysical profile,'A biophysical profile combines the information from a NST with an''ultrasound'' examination of the baby for a more precise evaluation.' 
A contraction stress test (CST),"'A contraction ''stress'"" test (CST), like the NST, measures fetal heart rate. However in this test, the baby's heart rate is measured in response to uterine contractions that are elicited by administering ""'oxytocin'' (''Pitocin'"") or by stimulation of the nipples. The test is sometimes referred to as an oxytocin challenge test. Normally, the flow of blood to the placenta slows during contractions, but if the placenta is functioning well, the baby's heart rate remains stable. If there is poor function of the placenta, the baby's heart rate will temporarily slow after a contraction. Looking at the baby's heart rate in response to uterine contractions can help the doctor estimate how the baby will respond to the stresses experienced during ""'labor''. This test is not performed as commonly as the NST or biophysical profile.' "
Amniocentesis,"'Although ''amniocentesis'' (removal of a sample of ''amniotic fluid'' with a long, thin needle) is most often done during the ''second trimester'', there are certain conditions that may warrant an amniocentesis later in pregnancy. These conditions include a suspicion of chorioamnionitis or a risk of premature delivery, since amniocentesis fluid can be used to estimate maturity of the fetal ''lungs''.' "
Ultrasound examinations,'Ultrasound examinations may be performed in the third trimester if needed to help evaluate fetal growth and look for problems with the placenta.' 
Facts you should know about urine tests for diabetes," Urine tests may be done in people with diabetes to evaluate severe hyperglycemia (severe high blood sugar) by looking for ketones in the urine. Ketones are a metabolic product produced when fat is metabolized. Ketones increase when there is insufficient insulin to use glucose for energy. Urine tests are also done to look for the presence of protein in the urine, which is a sign of kidney damage. Urine glucose measurements are less reliable than blood glucose measurements and are not used to diagnose diabetes or evaluate treatment for diabetes. They may be used for screening purposes. Testing for ketones is most common in people with type 1 diabetes. Both people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes typically have microalbumin testing."
What are urine tests for diabetes?,"""Urine tests are tests performed in a clinical laboratory or at home using self-test kits and a sample of the patient's urine. Urine tests can be performed for a variety of reasons, but in people with ""'diabetes'', they are most commonly used to look for ketones or microalbumin (see below). Urine glucose (''sugar'') can also be measured, but this is less valuable than blood glucose levels for diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes, so this is not commonly done as a way to monitor blood glucose status.'  "
Ketone test,"'This test detects the presence of ketones, which are byproducts of metabolism that form in the presence of severe hyperglycemia (elevated blood ''sugar''). Ketones are formed from fat that is burned by the body when there is insufficient insulin to allow glucose to be used for fuel. When ketones build up to high levels, ''ketoacidosis'' (a serious and life-threatening condition) may occur.''Ketone testing can be performed both at home and in the clinical laboratory. Ketones can be detected by dipping a test strip into a sample of urine. A color change on the test strip signals the presence of ketones in the urine. Ketones occur most commonly in people with ''type 1 diabetes'', but uncommonly, people with ''type 2 diabetes'' may test positive for ketones.' "
Microalbumin test,"'The microalbumin test detects microalbumin, a type of protein, in the urine. Protein is present in the urine when there is damage to the kidneys. Since the damage to blood vessels that occurs as a complication of diabetes can lead to kidney problems, the microalbumin test is done to check for damage to the kidneys over time.' "
Can urine tests diagnose diabetes?,"'While urine tests can show signs that may signal diabetes, such as elevated sugar or ketones, the diagnosis of diabetes is made on the basis of blood tests. Urine tests may be done in some cases as back-up testing or for screening to see if blood tests should be done, but the diagnosis of diabetes is made after blood glucose testing.' "
When are urine tests used in people with diabetes?,"'The ketone test is generally recommended for people with type 1 diabetes. Those with type 1 diabetes should test their urine for ketones when they are ill, especially if they have ''vomiting'' and ''nausea''. ''Pregnant'' women with type 1 diabetes may also be advised to test their urine for ketones. Ketone testing is also done when the blood sugar is noted to be very high (over about 240 mg/dL). Your doctor can advise you specifically about recommended testing practices for your individual situation. Sometimes, people with ''type 2 diabetes'' may be advised to check their urine for ketones. Those with type 2 diabetes should discuss with their doctor whether ketone testing is necessary and under what circumstances.''The microalbumin test is done once per year starting at the time of diagnosis in people with type 2 diabetes. Even though protein in the urine is a sign of long-term damage to the kidneys, many people have type 2 diabetes without knowing it, so it is unclear how long they have had the condition. In people with type 1 diabetes, the microalbumin test may not be performed until the condition has been present for up to 5 years.' "
Pregnancy Test Facts,"'*''Pregnancy'' test facts medically edited by: Charles Patrick Davis, MD, PhD' Pregnancy tests work by detecting a hormone in a woman's blood or urine: hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is produced when an egg implanted in the uterus. There are two types of pregnancy tests, one uses blood and the other uses urine (home tests); a quantitative blood test detects hCG earlier than a qualitative blood or urine test. Most home pregnancy tests detect hCG in a urine stream when, after a few minutes, a line or symbol appears if the test is positive (indicating pregnancy); most urine pregnancy test instructions urge a second test in a few days no matter what were the first results; follow package instructions – if a control indicator does not appear, the test result should not be trusted. Home tests are accurate, some better (more sensitive in showing early pregnancy) than others. Home pregnancy tests may test positive on the first day of a missed period, but almost all detect pregnancy 1 week after a missed period. Call your doctor for an appointment if you test positive for pregnancy with a home test. It is possible to be pregnant and have a negative home pregnancy test; that is why you should wait about a week to repeat the test. Most medicines and other compounds (alcohol, drugs) do not interfere with pregnancy tests; however, any drug containing hCG (some fertility drugs) may give false test results. Any questions or problems with pregnancy tests should be discussed with your doctor."
How do pregnancy tests work?,"'All pregnancy tests work by detecting a certain hormone in the urine or blood that is only there when a woman is pregnant. This hormone is called human chorionic gonadotropin (kohr-ee-ON-ihk goh-NAD-uh-TROH-puhn), or hCG. It is also called the pregnancy hormone.''hCG is made when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus. This usually happens about six days after the egg and sperm merge. But studies show that in up to 10 percent of women, implantation does not occur until much later, after the first day of the missed period. The amount of hCG rapidly builds up in your body with each passing day you are pregnant. '  "
Are there different types of pregnancy tests?,"""Yes. There are two types of pregnancy tests. One tests the blood for the pregnancy hormone, hCG. You need to see a doctor to have a blood test. The other checks the urine for the hCG hormone. You can do a urine test at a doctor's office or at home with a home pregnancy test (HPT).""""These days, many women first use an HPT to find out if they are pregnant. HPTs are inexpensive, private, and easy to use. HPTs also are highly accurate if used correctly and at the right time. HPTs will be able to tell if you're pregnant about one week after a missed period.  ""'Doctors use two types of blood tests to check for pregnancy. Blood tests can pick up hCG earlier in a pregnancy than urine tests can. Blood tests can tell if you are pregnant about six to eight days after you ovulate (or release an egg from an ovary). A quantitative blood test (or the beta hCG test) measures the exact amount of hCG in your blood. So it can find even tiny amounts of hCG. This makes it very accurate. A qualitative hCG blood test just checks to see if the pregnancy hormone is present or not. So this test gives a yes or no answer. The qualitative hCG blood test is about as accurate as a urine test.'  "
How do you do a home pregnancy test?,"'There are many different types of home pregnancy tests (HPTs). Most drugstores sell HPTs over the counter. They are inexpensive. But the cost depends on the brand and how many tests come in the box.''Most HPTs work in a similar way. Many instruct the user to hold a stick in the urine stream. Others involve collecting urine in a cup and then dipping the stick into it. At least one brand tells the woman to collect urine in a cup and then use a dropper to put a few drops of the urine into a special container. Then the woman needs to wait a few minutes. Different brands instruct the woman to wait different amounts of time. Once the time has passed, the user should inspect the ""result window."" If a line or plus symbol appears, you are pregnant. It does not matter how faint the line is. A line, whether bold or faint, means the result is positive. New digital tests show the words ""pregnant"" or ""not pregnant.""''Most tests also have a ""control indicator"" in the result window. This line or symbol shows whether the test is working properly. If the control indicator does not appear, the test is not working properly. You should not rely on any results from a HPT that may be faulty.'""Most brands tell users to repeat the test in a few days, no matter what the results. One negative result (especially soon after a missed period) does not always mean you're not pregnant. All HPTs come with written instructions. Most tests also have toll-free phone numbers to call in case of questions about use or results."" "
How accurate are home pregnancy tests?,"'Home pregnancy tests (HPTs) can be quite accurate. But the accuracy depends on:' How you use them: Be sure to check the expiration date and follow the instructions. Wait ten minutes after taking the test to check the results window. Research suggests that waiting 10 minutes will give the most accurate result. When you use them: The amount of hCG or pregnancy hormone in your urine increases with time. So, the earlier after a missed period you take the test, the harder it is to spot the hCG. Many HPTs claim to be 99 percent accurate on the first day of your missed period. But research suggests that most HPTs do not always detect the low levels of hCG usually present this early in pregnancy. And when they do, the results are often very faint. Most HPTs can accurately detect pregnancy one week after a missed period. Also, testing your urine first thing in the morning may boost the accuracy. Who uses them: Each woman ovulates at a different time in her menstrual cycle. Plus, the fertilized egg can implant in a woman's uterus at different times. hCG only is produced once implantation occurs. In up to 10 percent of women, implantation does not occur until after the first day of a missed period. So, HPTs will be accurate as soon as one day after a missed period for some women but not for others. The brand of test: Some HPTs are more sensitive than others. So, some tests are better than others at spotting hCG early on."
How soon after a missed period can I take a home pregnancy test and get an accurate result?,"'Many home pregnancy tests (HPTs) claim to be 99 percent accurate on the first day of your missed period. But research suggests that most HPTs do not always spot pregnancy that early. And when they do, the results are often so faint they are misunderstood. If you can wait one week after your missed period, most HPTs will give you an accurate answer. Ask your doctor for a more sensitive test if you need to know earlier.'  "
My home pregnancy test says I am pregnant. What should I do next?,"'If a home pregnancy test is positive and shows that you are pregnant, you should call your doctor right away. Your doctor can use a more sensitive test along with a ''pelvic exam'"" to tell for sure if you're pregnant. Seeing your doctor early on in your pregnancy will help you and your baby stay healthy."" "
My home pregnancy test says I'm not pregnant. Might I still be pregnant?,"'Yes. So, most home pregnancy tests (HPTs) suggest women take the test again in a few days or a week if the result is negative.'""Each woman ovulates at a different time in her menstrual cycle. Plus, the fertilized egg can implant in a woman's uterus at different times. So, the accuracy of HPT results varies from woman to woman. Other things can also affect the accuracy. Sometimes women get false negative results when they test too early in the pregnancy. This means that the test says you are not pregnant when you are. Other times, problems with the pregnancy can affect the amount of hCG in the urine.""'If your HPT is negative, test yourself again in a few days or one week. If you keep getting a negative result but think you are pregnant, talk with your doctor right away.' "
Can anything affect home pregnancy test results?,"'Most medicines should not affect the results of a home pregnancy test (HPT). This includes ''over-the-counter'' and prescription medicines, including ''birth control pills'"" and antibiotics. Only medicines that have the pregnancy hormone hCG in them can give a false positive test result. A false positive is when a test says you are pregnant when you're not. Sometimes medicines containing hCG are used to treat ""'infertility'' (not being able to get pregnant).''Alcohol and illegal drugs do not affect HPT results. But do not use these substances if you are trying to become pregnant or are sexually active and could become pregnant.' "
Prenatal care and tests introduction,"'Medical checkups and screening tests help keep you and your baby healthy during pregnancy. This is called prenatal care. It also involves education and counseling about how to handle different aspects of your pregnancy. During your visits, your doctor may discuss many issues, such as healthy eating and physical activity, screening tests you might need, and what to expect during ''labor and delivery''.' "
Choosing a prenatal care provider,"'You will see your prenatal care provider many times before you have your baby. So you want to be sure that the person you choose has a good reputation, and listens to and respects you. You will want to find out if the doctor or ''midwife'' can deliver your baby in the place you want to give birth, such as a specific hospital or birthing center. Your provider also should be willing and able to give you the information and support you need to make an informed choice about whether to breastfeed or bottle-feed.''Health care providers that care for women during pregnancy include:''Check with your health insurance company to find out if they will cover the cost of a doula. When choosing a doula, find out if she is certified by Doulas of North America (DONA) or another professional group.''Ask your primary care doctor, friends, and family members for provider recommendations. When making your choice, think about:' Obstetricians (OB) are medical doctors who specialize in the care of pregnant women and in delivering babies. OBs also have special training in surgery so they are also able to do acesarean delivery. Women who have health problems or are at risk for pregnancy complications should see an obstetrician. Women with the highest risk pregnancies might need special care from a maternal-fetal medicine specialist.
 Family practice doctors are medical doctors who provide care for the whole family through all stages of life. This includes care during pregnancy and delivery, and following birth. Most family practice doctors cannot perform cesarean deliveries. A certified nurse-midwife (CNM) and certified professional midwife (CPM) are trained to provide pregnancy and postpartum care. Midwives can be a good option for healthy women at low risk for problems during pregnancy, labor, or delivery. A CNM is educated in both nursing and midwifery. Most CNMs practice in hospitals and birth centers. A CPM is required to have experience delivering babies in home settings because most CPMs practice in homes and birthing centers. All midwives should have a back-up plan with an obstetrician in case of a problem or emergency. A doula (DOO-luh) is a professional labor coach, who gives physical and emotional support to women during labor and delivery. They offer advice on breathing, relaxation, movement, and positioning. Doulas also give emotional support and comfort to women and their partners during labor and birth. Doulas and midwives often work together during a woman's labor. A recent study showed that continuous doula support during labor was linked to shorter labors and much lower use of:

Places to deliver your baby,"""Many women have strong views about where and how they'd like to deliver their babies. In general, women can choose to deliver at a hospital, birth center, or at home. You will need to contact your health insurance provider to find out what options are available. Also, find out if the doctor or midwife you are considering can deliver your baby in the place you want to give birth.""'Hospitals'' are a good choice for women with health problems, pregnancy complications, or those who are at risk for problems during labor and delivery. Hospitals offer the most advanced medical equipment and highly trained doctors for ''pregnant'' women and their babies. In a hospital, doctors can do a cesarean delivery if you or your baby is in danger during labor. Women can get epidurals or many other ''pain'' relief options. Also, more and more hospitals now offer on-site birth centers, which aim to offer a style of care similar to standalone birth centers.''Questions to ask when choosing a hospital:''Birth or birthing centers'' give women a ""homey"" environment in which to labor and give birth. They try to make labor and delivery a natural and personal process by doing away with most high-tech equipment and routine procedures. So, you will not automatically be hooked up to an IV. Likewise, you won\'t have an electronic fetal monitor around your belly the whole time. Instead, the midwife or nurse will check in on your baby from time to time with a handheld machine. Once the baby is born, all exams and care will occur in your room. Usually certified nurse-midwives, not obstetricians, deliver babies at birth centers. Healthy women who are at low risk for problems during pregnancy, labor, and delivery may choose to deliver at a birth center.''Women cannot receive epidurals at a birth center, although some ''pain'' medicines may be available. If a cesarean delivery becomes necessary, women must be moved to a hospital for the procedure. After delivery, babies with problems can receive basic emergency care while being moved to a hospital.''Many birthing centers have showers or tubs in their rooms for laboring women. They also tend to have comforts of home like large beds and rocking chairs. In general, birth centers allow more people in the delivery room than do hospitals. ''Birth centers can be inside of hospitals, a part of a hospital or completely separate facilities. If you want to deliver at a birth center, make sure it meets the standards of the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, The Joint Commission, or the American Association of Birth Centers. Accredited birth centers must have doctors who can work at a nearby hospital in case of problems with the mom or baby. Also, make sure the birth center has the staff and set-up to support.''Homebirth'"" is an option for healthy pregnant women with no risk factors for complications during pregnancy, labor or delivery. It is also important women have a strong after-care support system at home. Some certified nurse midwives and doctors will deliver babies at home. Many health insurance companies do not cover the cost of care for homebirths. So check with your plan if you'd like to deliver at home.""""Homebirths are common in many countries in Europe. However, in the United States, planned homebirths are not supported by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). ACOG states that hospitals are the safest place to deliver a baby. In case of an emergency, says ACOG, a hospital's equipment and highly trained doctors can provide the best care for a woman and her baby.""'If you are thinking about a homebirth, you need to weigh the pros and cons. The main advantage is that you will be able to experience labor and delivery in the privacy and comfort of your own home. Since there will be no routine medical procedures, you will have control of your experience.''The main disadvantage of a homebirth is that in case of a problem, you and the baby will not have immediate hospital/medical care. It will have to wait until you are transferred to the hospital. Plus, women who deliver at home have no options for pain relief. ''To ensure your safety and that of your baby, you must have a highly trained and experienced midwife along with a fail-safe back-up plan. You will need fast, reliable transportation to a hospital. If you live far away from a hospital, homebirth may not be the best choice. Your midwife must be experienced and have the necessary skills and supplies to start emergency care for you and your baby if need be. Your midwife should also have access to a doctor 24 hours a day.' Is it close to your home?  Is a doctor who can give pain relief, such as an epidural, at the hospital 24-hours a day?

Prenatal checkups,"'During pregnancy, regular checkups are very important. This consistent care can help keep you and your baby healthy, spot problems if they occur, and prevent problems during delivery. Typically, routine checkups occur:''Women with high-risk pregnancies need to see their doctors more often.''At your first visit your doctor will perform a full physical exam, take your blood for lab tests, and calculate your due date. Your doctor might also do a breast exam, a ''pelvic exam'' to check your uterus (womb), and a cervical exam, including a ''Pap test'"". During this first visit, your doctor will ask you lots of questions about your lifestyle, relationships, and health habits. It's important to be honest with your doctor.""'After the first visit, most prenatal visits will include:''You also will have some routine tests throughout your pregnancy, such as tests to look foranemia, tests to measure risk of gestational ''diabetes'', and tests to look for harmful infections.''Become a partner with your doctor to manage your care.

Monitor your baby's activity,"'After 28 weeks, keep track of your baby\'s movement. This will help you to notice if your baby is moving less than normal, which could be a sign that your baby is in distress and needs a doctor\'s care. An easy way to do this is the ""count-to-10"" approach. Count your baby\'s movements in the evening — the time of day when the fetus tends to be most active. Lie down if you have trouble feeling your baby move. Most women count 10 movements within about one hour. It is rare for a woman to count less than 10 movements within two hours at times when the baby is active. Count your baby\'s movements every day so you know what is normal for you. Call your doctor if you count less than 10 movements within two hours or if you notice your baby is moving less than normal. If your baby is not moving at all, call your doctor right away.' "
Prenatal tests,"""Tests are used during pregnancy to check your and your baby's health. At your fist prenatal visit, your doctor will use tests to check for a number of things, such as:""'Throughout your pregnancy, your doctor or midwife may suggest a number of other tests, too. Some tests are suggested for all women, such as screenings for gestational ''diabetes'', ''Down syndrome'', and ''HIV''. Other tests might be offered based on your:''Some tests are screening tests. They detect risks for or signs of ''possible'' health problems in you or your baby. Based on screening test results, your doctor might suggest diagnostic tests. Diagnostic tests confirm or rule out health problems in you or your baby. ''The following chart describes some of the most common prenatal tests:'""If your doctor suggests certain prenatal tests, don't be afraid to ask lots of questions. Learning about the test, why your doctor is suggesting it for you, and what the test results could mean can help you cope with any worries or fears you might have. Keep in mind that screening tests do not diagnose problems. They evaluate risk. So if a screening test comes back abnormal, this doesn't mean there is a problem with your baby. More information is needed. Your doctor can explain what test results mean and possible next steps.""

High-risk pregnancy,"'Pregnancies with a greater chance of complications are called ""high-risk."" But this doesn\'t mean there will be problems. The following factors may increase the risk of problems during pregnancy:''Health problems also may develop during a pregnancy that make it high-risk, such as ''gestational diabetes'' or ''preeclampsia''.''Women with high-risk pregnancies need prenatal care more often and sometimes from a specially trained doctor. A maternal-fetal medicine specialist is a medical doctor that cares for high-risk pregnancies.'""If your pregnancy is considered high risk, you might worry about your unborn baby's health and have trouble enjoying your pregnancy. Share your concerns with your doctor. Your doctor can explain your risks and the chances of a real problem. Also, be sure to follow your doctor's advice.

What is tetanus?,"'Tetanus is an acute, often-fatal disease of the nervous system that is caused by nerve toxins produced by the bacterium ''Clostridium tetani''. This bacterium is found throughout the world in the soil and in animal and human ''intestines''. The bacterium can also lay dormant in its spore form for years before becoming activated and developing into a regularly reproducing bacterium.'  "
Where do tetanus bacteria grow in the body?,"'Contaminated wounds are sites where tetanus bacteria multiply. Deep wounds or those with dead tissue are particularly prone to tetanus infection.''Puncture wounds'', such as those caused by nails, splinters, or ''insect bites'', are favorite locations of entry for the bacteria. The bacteria can also be introduced through ''burns'', any break in the skin, and injection-drug sites. Tetanus can also be a hazard to both the mother and ''newborn'' child (by means of the uterus after delivery and through the umbilical cord stump).''The potent toxin that is produced when the tetanus bacteria multiply is the major cause of harm from tetanus.' "
How does the tetanus toxin cause damage to the body?,"'The tetanus toxin affects the interaction between the nerve and the muscle that it stimulates, specifically at the neuromuscular junction. The tetanus toxin amplifies the chemical signal from the nerve to the muscle, which causes the muscles to tighten up in a continuous (""tetanic"" or ""tonic"") contraction or spasm. This results in either localized or generalized ''muscle spasms''. Tetanus toxin can affect neonates to cause muscle spasms, inability to nurse, and ''seizures''. This typically occurs within the first two weeks after birth and can be associated with poor sanitation methods in caring for the umbilical cord stump of the neonate. Of note, because of tetanus vaccination programs, first introduced in the late 1940s, tetanus infection rates have dropped substantially. In fact, according to the World Health Organization, there have only been three cases of ''neonatal'' tetanus reported in the U.S. since 2000. In each of these cases, the mothers were incompletely immunized. Unfortunately, throughout the world, tetanus is still common. In 2014, there were over 2,000 cases of neonatal tetanus and over 9,000 cases of non-neonatal tetanus. In comparison, there were 114,000 overall cases reported in 1980.' "
What is the incubation period for tetanus?,"""The incubation period between exposure to the bacteria in a contaminated wound and development of the initial symptoms of tetanus ranges from two days to two months, but it's commonly within 14 days of injury."" "
What is the course of tetanus? What are tetanus symptoms and signs?,"'During a one- to seven-day period, progressive muscle spasms caused by the tetanus toxin in the immediate wound area may progress to involve the entire body in a set of continuous muscle contractions. Restlessness, ''headache'', and irritability are common.''The tetanus neurotoxin causes the muscles to tighten up into a continuous (""tetanic"" or ""tonic"") contraction or spasm. The jaw is ""locked"" by muscle spasms, giving the name ""lockjaw"" (also called ""trismus""). Muscles throughout the body are affected, including the vital muscles necessary for normal ''breathing''. When the breathing muscles lose their power, breathing becomes difficult or impossible and death can occur without life-support measures (mechanical ventilation). Even with breathing support, infections of the airways within the ''lungs'' can lead to death.'  "
Is tetanus contagious?,"'Tetanus is not ''contagious''. You cannot ""catch"" tetanus from another infected individual. That means one person cannot be infected by another individual by coming in contact with secretions or other exposures. The bacterial spores must enter a wound to develop into an infection.' "
What is the treatment for tetanus?,"'General measures to treat the sources of the bacterial infection with antibiotics and drainage are carried out in the hospital while the patient is monitored for any signs of compromised breathing muscles. Treatment is directed toward stopping toxin production, neutralizing its effects, and controlling muscle spasms. Sedation is often given for ''muscle spasm'', which can lead to life-threatening breathing difficulty.''In more severe cases, breathing assistance with an artificial respirator machine may be needed.''The toxin already circulating in the body is neutralized with antitoxin ''drugs''. The tetanus toxin causes no permanent damage to the nervous system after the patient recovers.''After recovery, patients still require active immunization because having the tetanus disease does not provide natural immunization against a repeat episode.'  "
"How is tetanus diagnosed, and what is the prognosis of tetanus?","'The diagnosis of tetanus is made clinically, based on a patient\'s history of exposure such as stepping on a rusty nail in the backyard, and by the symptoms present, such as ""lockjaw,"" ''difficulty swallowing'', ''fever'', and generalized muscle spasms.''Once diagnosed and treated, the prognosis is generally good if the patient receives appropriate care early in the illness. The toxin does no permanent damage, and patients who receive appropriate supportive care generally recover. Sometimes symptoms develop rapidly, and some people live in remote areas where they are not able to receive appropriate care and are at a higher risk of death from tetanus.' "
Is it possible to prevent tetanus?,"'Active immunization (""tetanus ''vaccine''"") plays an essential role in preventing tetanus. Preventative measures to protect the skin from being penetrated by the tetanus bacteria are also important. For instance, precautions should be taken to avoid stepping on nails by wearing shoes. If a penetrating wound should occur, it should be thoroughly cleansed with soap and water and medical attention should be sought. Finally, passive immunization can be administered in selected cases (with specialized immunoglobulin).' "
What is the schedule for active immunization (tetanus shots)?,"'All'' children should be immunized against tetanus by receiving a series of five DTaP vaccinations, which generally are started at 2 months of age and completed at approximately 5 years of age. Booster vaccination is recommended at 11 years of age with Tdap.''Follow-up booster vaccination is recommended every 10 years thereafter. While a 10-year period of protection exists after the basic childhood series is completed, should a potentially contaminated wound occur, an ""early"" booster may be given in selected cases and the 10-year ""clock"" resets.'  "
What are the side effects of tetanus immunization?,"'Side effects of tetanus immunization occur in approximately 25% of vaccine recipients. The most frequent side effects are usually quite mild (and familiar) and include soreness, swelling, and/or redness at the site of the injection. More significant reactions are extraordinarily rare. The incidence of this particular reaction increases with decreasing interval between boosters.' "
What is passive immunization (by way of specialized immunoglobulin)?,"'In individuals who exhibit the early symptoms of tetanus or in those whose immunization status is unknown or significantly out of date, the tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) is given into the muscle surrounding the wound with the remainder of the dose given into the buttocks.' "
What is tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency?,"'Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency is a rare disorder that increases the levels of several substances, including phenylalanine, in the blood. Phenylalanine is a building block of proteins (an amino acid) that is obtained through the ''diet''. It is found in all proteins and in some ''artificial sweeteners''. If tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency is not treated, phenylalanine can build up to harmful levels in the body, causing intellectual disability and other serious health problems.' "
What are the symptoms of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency?,"'High levels of phenylalanine are present from early infancy in people with untreated tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency. Infants with this condition appear normal at birth, but medical problems ranging from mild to severe become apparent over time.''The signs and symptoms of this condition can include:'  intellectual disability,  progressive problems 
with development, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, seizures, behavioral problems, and an inability to control body temperature. "
How common is tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency?,"'This condition is very rare, affecting about 1 per million newborns. In most parts of the world, tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency accounts for only 1 percent to 2 percent of all cases of elevated phenylalanine levels. The remaining cases are caused by a similar condition called  ''phenylketonuria'' (PKU). In certain countries, including Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, China, and Turkey, it is more common for elevated levels of phenylalanine to be caused by tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency.' "
What genes are related to tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency?,"'Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency can be caused by mutations in one of several genes, including GCH1, PCBD1, PTS, and QDPR. These genes provide instructions for making enzymes that help produce and recycle tetrahydrobiopterin in the body. Tetrahydrobiopterin (also known as BH4) is a molecule that helps process several amino acids, including phenylalanine. It is also involved in the production of chemicals called neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells in the brain.''If one of the enzymes fails to function correctly because of a gene mutation, little or no tetrahydrobiopterin is available to help process phenylalanine. As a result, phenylalanine can build up in the blood and other tissues. Because nerve cells in the brain are particularly sensitive to phenylalanine levels, excessive amounts of this substance can cause ''brain damage''. Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency can also alter the levels of certain neurotransmitters, which disrupts normal brain function. ' "
How do people inherit tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency?,"'This condition is ''inherited'' in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.' "

What is thallium?,"""Pure thallium is a bluish-white metal that is found in trace amounts in the earth's crust. In the past, thallium was obtained as a by-product from smelting other metals; however, it has not been produced in the United States since 1984. Currently, all the thallium is obtained from imports and from thallium reserves.""'In its pure form, thallium is odorless and tasteless. It can also be found combined with other substances such as bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and ''iodine'"". When it's combined, it appears colorless-to-white or yellow. ""'Thallium is used mostly in manufacturing electronic devices, switches, and closures, primarily for the semiconductor industry. It also has limited use in the manufacture of special glass and for certain medical procedures. ' "
What happens to thallium when it enters the environment?,"""Thallium enters the environment primarily from coal-burning and smelting, in which it is a trace contaminant of the raw materials. It stays in the air, water, and soil for a long time and is not broken down. Some thallium compounds are removed from the atmosphere in rain and snow. It's absorbed by plants and enters the food chain. It builds up in fish and shellfish. "" "
How might I be exposed to thallium?,"   Eating food contaminated with thallium may be a major source of exposure for most people. Breathing workplace air in industries that use thallium. Smoking cigarettes. Living near hazardous waste sites containing thallium (may result in higher than normal exposures). Touching or, for children, eating soil contaminated with thallium. Breathing low levels in air and water."
How can thallium affect my health?,"'Exposure to high levels of thallium can result in harmful health effects. A study on workers exposed on the job over several years reported nervous system effects, such as numbness of fingers and toes, from breathing thallium. ''Studies in people who ingested large amounts of thallium over a short time have reported ''vomiting'', ''diarrhea'', temporary ''hair loss'', and effects on the nervous system, ''lungs'', ''heart'', ''liver'', and kidneys. It has caused death. It is not known what the effects are from ingesting low levels of thallium over a long time. ''Birth defects'' were not reported in the children of mothers exposed to low levels from eating vegetables and fruits contaminated with thallium. Studies in rats, however, exposed to high levels of thallium, showed adverse developmental effects. ''It is not known if breathing or ingesting thallium affects human reproduction. Studies showed that rats that ingested thallium for several weeks had some adverse reproductive effects. Animal data suggest that the male reproductive system may be susceptible to damage by low levels of thallium. ''There is no information available on the health effects of skin contact with thallium in people or animals. ' "
How likely is thallium to cause cancer?,"'The Department of Health and Human Services, the International Agency for Research on ''Cancer'', and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have not classified thallium as to its human carcinogenicity. ''No studies are available in people or animals on the carcinogenic effects of breathing, ingesting, or touching thallium. ' "
Is there a medical test to show whether I've been exposed to thallium?,"'There are medical tests available to measure levels of thallium in urine and hair. In addition, thallium can also be measured in blood; however, this is not a good indicator of exposure since thallium only stays in blood a very short time. '""These tests require special equipment that is not usually available in most doctor's offices. In addition, these tests cannot determine if adverse health effects will occur from the exposure to thallium. ""  "
Has the federal government made recommendations to protect human health?,"'The EPA requires that discharges or accidental spills into the environment of 1,000 pounds or more of thallium be reported. ''The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set an exposure limit of 0.1 milligrams per cubic meter (0.1 mg/m³) for thallium in workplace air. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has established the same guidelines as OSHA for the workplace. ''The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that 15 mg/m³ of thallium be considered immediately dangerous to life and health. This is the exposure level of a chemical that is likely to cause permanent health problems or death. ''Carcinogenicity: Ability to cause ''cancer''. ''Ingesting: Taking food or drink into your body.

Top 10 diets,"'Diet'' means a reduction in calorie intake. For the optimal management of ''overweight'' and ''obese'' patients, a combination of ''diet'', ''exercise'', and behavioral modifications may be helpful. ''Weight loss'' is directly related to the difference between the individual’s energy intake and energy expenditure. Reducing caloric intake below expenditure should help in ''weight loss''. Different diets may help one to ''lose weight'' and improve overall health. However, the top 10 best diet plans certified by physicians are as follows:''Mediterranean diet'': This refers to the dietary pattern followed by the olive-growing regions of the Mediterranean. The ''Mediterranean diet'' mainly consists of foods rich in monounsaturated ''fats''; moderate consumption of ''alcohol'', especially wine; high consumptions of fruits and vegetables; moderate consumption of milk and dairy products; and low consumption of meat and meat products. It is associated with several health benefits such as a reduction in the risk of ''cardiovascular disease'' and ''diabetes''.''DASH diet'':'' DASH refers to dietary approaches to stop ''hypertension''. It comprises four to five servings of fruit, four to five servings of vegetables, and two to three servings of low-fat dairy per day. It specifically advocates a low intake of sodium in diet. So no salt use at the dinner table, no pickles, chips, sauces with added salt. DASH diet along with physical ''exercise'' for 25 minutes may result in a ''weight loss'' of an average of 5.8 kg.''Intermittent fasting'': It is characterized by alternate-day fasting and time-restricted feed. Fasting for a restricted time every day may help in weight loss.\xa0''Low-fat diet'': Reduction in the daily intake of fat less than 30 percent of energy intake helps in weight loss. Low-fat dietary pattern with healthy carbohydrates may prevent ''weight gain''. Increased intake of vegetables or fruits can also aid in weight loss.''Low-carbohydrates diet'': High-carbohydrate diets have been associated with weight gain. Hence, a low-carbohydrates diet along with a food rich in unsaturated fat and protein can decrease the risk of ''heart disease'', ''diabetes mellitus'', and some ''cancers''. Low-carbohydrate diets are probably useful in short-term weight loss. In this diet the foods included are:''High-protein diets'': High-protein diets are more filling and help in stimulating the production of heat.\xa0\xa0''Vegetarian'' diet:'' Vegetarian diet mainly consists of cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts. There are different types of vegetarianism depending on the foods consumed. These include:''Eating a vegetarian diet is associated with a lower chance of ''obesity'', ''heart disease'', increased ''blood pressure'', ''diabetes'', and certain ''cancer''.''Low-''cholesterol'' diet'': Increased cholesterol is linked to increased risk of ''heart disease''. Daily cholesterol consumption should be limited to 300 mg or less.''High-''fiber'' diet:'' Fibers are satiating and indirectly helps with weight loss. High fiber foods include:''Portion-controlled diet:'' To control the temptation of overeating, serving the food on an individual plate, instead of placing the serving dishes on the table. This may discourage the person from overeating. In short, take control of the amount of food taken daily.' non-starchy vegetables eggs nuts seeds full-fat dairy natural fats (like avocado, butter, and coconut oil/cream)  meat poultry fish legumes  fruit is usually limited. Semi-vegetarian: Chicken meat or fish may be included in this diet, but red meat would be completely excluded. Lacto-ovovegetarian: Eggs, milk, and milk products are included, but meat is avoided Lactovegetarian: Milk and milk products are consumed, but, meat and eggs are avoided. Vegan: All animal products, including eggs, milk, and milk products, are avoided from the diet. Honey may also be excluded. Some may also avoid processed food or foods that are not organically grown.

What are the seven most important layers of your skin?,"""The skin is the largest organ in the body and it covers the body's entire external surface. It is made up of seven layers ([starting from the top layer down to the bottom [deepest] layer):""'The first five layers form the ''epidermis'', which is the outermost, thick layer of the skin.''All seven layers vary significantly in their anatomy and function.''The skin serves various functions that include acting as the body’s initial barrier against germs, UV light, chemicals and mechanical injury. It also maintains body temperature and prevents water loss from the body.' Stratum corneum Stratum lucidum Stratum granulosum Stratum spinosum Stratum basale  Dermis Hypodermis"
What are the functions of the five layers of the epidermis?,"'Stratum corneum:''Stratum lucidum: ''This thin clear layer is only present in the thicker skin (palms and soles).''Stratum granulosum: ''The chemicals (glycolipids) secreted in this layer keep the skin cells glued to each other.''Stratum spinosum (also known as a prickle cell layer):'' This layer contains dendritic cells, which are the skin’s first line defenders.''Stratum basale (Stratum germinativum):' This is the topmost layer of the skin and is made up of keratin. This layer varies greatly in thickness in various regions of the body when compared to the other layers. This layer plays the first line of defense against external agents. This is the deepest layer of the epidermis. The cells found in this layer are constantly producing keratinocytes, which play an important role in the formation of Vitamin D with exposure to sunlight. Keratinocytes also produce a protein, keratin, and lipids; these act as a protective barrier. This layer also contains melanocytes. Melanocytes produce melanin, which is a natural pigment responsible for the color of the skin."
What is the function of the dermis layer?,"'The dermis is connected to the epidermis and is made of collagen (a type of connective tissue), which gives the skin its flexibility and strength. It also houses the sweat glands, oil glands (sebaceous glands), hair, hair follicles, muscles, nerve endings, blood vessels and dendritic cells. The function of each of these components are as follows''The nerve endings sense ''pain'', touch, pressure and temperature.''The sweat glands produce sweat with exposure to heat and ''stress''. As sweat evaporates off the skin, it helps cool the body.''The sebaceous glands secrete sebum into the skin. Sebum is an oily substance that keeps the skin moist and soft and acts as a barrier against foreign substances.''The hair follicles produce the various types of hair found throughout the body. Hair regulates body temperature and provides protection against external injury.''The blood vessels of the dermis provide nutrients to the skin and help regulate body temperature.' "
What is the function of the hypodermis layer?,"'The hypodermis is the deepest layer of skin situated below the dermis. It is also called the subcutaneous fascia or subcutaneous layer. It contains fat along with some structures like hair follicles, nerve endings and blood vessels. The presence of fat helps insulate the body from heat and ''cold'' and serves as an energy storage area.' "
Does skin thickness vary?," Skin thickness varies considerably all over the body. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet have the thickest skin because the epidermis contains an extra layer, the stratum lucidum, that is absent in other regions. The thinnest skin is found on the eyelids and behind the ear (postauricular) region (0.05 mm thick). Male skin is characteristically thicker than female skin. Children have relatively thin skin, which progressively thickens until 40 to 50 years of age, and then it begins to get thinner."
What is altitude sickness?,"'Altitude sickness or mountain sickness, also called acute mountain sickness (AMS), refers to a group of symptoms occurring on climbing or ''walking'' to a higher altitude or elevation too quickly.\xa0 Since the body is unable to take in enough oxygen, breathing becomes difficult. It can become a medical emergency if ignored.\xa0' "
What causes altitude sickness?,"'Altitude sickness occurs when a person moves to a higher altitude too quickly. This does not give time to the body to adjust to the low air pressure and low oxygen at high altitudes. The symptoms happen due to low oxygen (''hypoxia'') in the air and blood causing the blood vessels of the brain to swell (dilate). The dilated blood vessels in the brain may cause ''headaches'' and swelling of the brain. The swelling puts pressure on the brain, squeezing it against the skull.\xa0''Altitude sickness may rarely advance to a more severe form of the illness called high altitude cerebral edema (HACE). HACE occurs when brain swelling becomes severe manifesting as severe ''headache'', ''confusion'', lethargy, lack of coordination, irritability, ''vomiting'', ''seizures'', ''coma'' and eventually death if untreated.''In some cases, the low oxygen causes the ''lungs'' to become leaky and accumulate fluid. This is called ''high altitude pulmonary edema'' (HAPE). This may cause ''cough'', chest discomfort, pink frothy sputum and ''heart failure''.' "
Who is at risk for altitude sickness?,"'Altitude sickness may affect anyone regardless of their age, gender or level of physical ''fitness''. Altitude sickness is directly related to how rapid the climb to high altitude is. It is more likely to occur if the climbs are more difficult and take more strength and energy than with a slow and easy climb.''Some of the factors that determine a person’s risk for altitude sickness are:' Genetic makeup A history of previous altitude sickness Residing at an altitude below 3,000 ft Presence of respiratory infections or diseases Obesity A rapid rate of ascent Over-exertion before the climb Alcohol consumption  Taking sleeping pills"
What is stasis dermatitis?,"'Stasis dermatitis, also known as gravitational dermatitis, venous ''eczema'', or venous stasis dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. It is caused because of the pooling of blood in the legs. Stasis dermatitis occurs due to poor blood flow, particularly in the lower limbs.' "
Who gets stasis dermatitis?,'Stasis dermatitis typically affects middle-aged and elderly persons. It can be associated with' History of deep vein thrombosis and cellulitis Varicose veins Venous ulcers Pregnancy Female gender Age over 50 years History of cellulitis in the affected leg Previous injury to the area High blood pressure Congestive heart failure (a weakened heart that cannot pump blood effectively) Kidney failure Obesity Lack of exercise Prolonged sitting or standing job
What causes stasis dermatitis?,"'In the lower limbs, there is a muscle pump that pushes the blood toward the heart. This pump along with the veins (with valves) prevents the pooling of the blood in the lower limb. In case of valve damage or weakened valves, a back pressure develops, leading to the pooling of blood in the tissues (stasis). The pooling of blood can mediate an inflammatory reaction in the skin (dermatitis). This is often seen in ''deep vein thrombosis'' or ''varicose veins''.''Stasis dermatitis can also be linked to a condition, in which the venous wall or valves in the leg veins do not work efficiently. This condition is known as ''venous insufficiency''.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of stasis dermatitis?,"'Swelling around the ankle is the first sign of the stasis dermatitis. When the swelling starts, below symptoms may be noticed:''As the disease progresses, the following symptoms may be noticed:''If untreated, stasis dermatitis can worsen causing the following symptoms:' Pain or heaviness in the leg while walking or standing for a long time Swelling that disappears when sleeping and re-appears during the day Varicose veins Itchy, dry skin Irritation, swelling of the skin Swelling spreads from ankle to calf Dry, cracked, itchy skin Shiny skin Red to violet-colored open sores Sores leak fluid Sores can cause scars The affected area feels hard Intensely itching skin Redness and scale cover the area Skin becomes deeply pigmented (dark in color)"
What is gonorrhea? How do you get it?,"'Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection caused by the organism\xa0''Neisseria gonorrhoeae''\xa0that is transmitted during unprotected sex. Gonorrhea is one of the oldest known ''sexually transmitted diseases''. Among individuals who are infected with gonorrhea, 50% to 70% also will be infected with ''chlamydia'', another type of bacteria that causes another ''STD''.''Contrary to popular belief, gonorrhea cannot be transmitted from toilet seats or door handles. The bacterium that causes gonorrhea requires very specific conditions for growth and reproduction. It cannot live outside the body for more than a few seconds or minutes, nor can it live on the skin of the hands, arms, or legs. It survives only on moist surfaces within the body and is found most commonly in the vagina, and, more commonly, the cervix. (The cervix is the end of the uterus that protrudes into the vagina.) It can also live in the tube (urethra) through which urine drains from the bladder. ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' can even exist in the back of the throat (from oral sex) and in the rectum (from anal sex).' "
Is gonorrhea an STD?,"'Sexually transmitted diseases (''STDs'') are infections that can be transferred from one sexual partner to another through any type of sexual contact. ''STDs'' are sometimes referred to as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) since they involve the transmission of a disease-causing organism from one person to another during sexual activity. It is important to realize that sexual contact includes more than just sexual intercourse (vaginal and anal). Sexual contact includes kissing, oral sex, and the use of sexual ""toys,"" such as vibrators. STDs probably have been around for thousands of years, but the most dangerous of these conditions, the ''acquired immunodeficiency syndrome'' (''AIDS'') was first recognized in 1981, and the causative\xa0''human immunodeficiency virus''\xa0(''HIV''), was first identified in 1984.''Many STDs are treatable, but effective cures are lacking for others, such as ''HIV'', ''HPV''\xa0(human papilloma virus), and possibly\xa0''hepatitis B''. Even gonorrhea, once easily cured, has become resistant to many of the older traditional antibiotics. Many STDs can be present in, and spread by, people who do not have any symptoms of the condition and have not yet been diagnosed with an STD. Therefore, public awareness and education about these infections and the methods of preventing them is important.''There really is no such thing as ""safe"" sex. The only truly effective way to prevent STDs is abstinence. Sex in the context of a monogamous relationship wherein neither party is infected with a STD also is considered ""safe."" Most people think that kissing is a safe activity. Unfortunately, ''syphilis'', ''herpes'', and other infections can be contracted through this relatively simple and apparently harmless act. All other forms of sexual contact carry some risk. ''Condoms'' are commonly thought to protect against STDs. While condoms are useful in decreasing the spread of certain infections, such as ''chlamydia'' and gonorrhea, they do not fully protect against other infections such as ''genital herpes'', ''genital warts'', ''syphilis'', and ''AIDS''. ''Prevention'' of the spread of STDs is dependent upon the counseling of at-risk individuals and the early diagnosis and treatment of infections.' "
What are the early symptomssigns and of gonorrhea? What symptoms develop later?,"'Most infected women have no symptoms, especially in the early stages of the infection.''Gonorrhea symptoms and signs include:''Untreated gonorrhea can lead to a severe pelvic infection with inflammation of the Fallopian tubes and ovaries. Gonorrheal infection of the Fallopian tubes can lead to a serious, painful infection of the pelvis known as ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' or PID. PID occurs in many women with gonorrheal infection of the uterine cervix. Symptoms of pelvic infection include ''fever'', pelvic cramping, ''pelvic pain'', or ''pain'' with intercourse. Pelvic infection can lead to difficulty in ''becoming pregnant'' or even ''infertility'' because of tubal damage or obstruction. Occasionally, if the infection is severe enough, a localized area of infection and pus-like discharge (an abscess) forms (tubo-ovarian abscess) that can be life-threatening, and major surgery may be necessary. Gonorrhea infections in people with conditions causing seriously ''depressed'' immune function, such as ''AIDS'' or immunosuppressive treatments, can be even more serious.'  Burning Frequent, and/or painful urination Yellowish vaginal discharge Redness and swelling of the genitals Burning or itching of the vaginal area Sore throat"
How is gonorrhea diagnosed?,"'Testing for gonorrhea is done by swabbing the infected site (rectum, throat, cervix) and identifying the bacteria in the laboratory either through culturing of the material from the swab (growing the bacteria) or identification of the genetic material from the bacteria. Sometimes the tests do not show bacteria because of sampling errors (the sampled area does not contain bacteria) or other technical difficulties, even when the woman has an infection. Newer tests to diagnose gonorrhea involve the use of DNA probes or amplification techniques (for example, ''polymerase chain reaction'', or ''PCR'') to identify the genetic material of the bacteria. These tests are more expensive than cultures but typically yield more rapid results.' "
What are the treatments for gonorrhea? Can gonorrhea be cured?,"'In the past, the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea was fairly simple. A single injection of ''penicillin'' cured almost every infected person. Unfortunately, there are new ''strains'' of gonorrhea that have become resistant to various antibiotics, including ''penicillins'', and are therefore more difficult to treat. Fortunately, gonorrhea can still be treated by other injectable or oral medications.''Uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, and rectum, are usually treated by a single injection of ceftriaxone intramuscularly or by\xa0''cefixime'' (''Suprax'') in a single oral dose. For uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the pharynx, the recommended treatment is ceftriaxone in a single IM dose.''Alternative regimens for uncomplicated gonococcal infections of the cervix, urethra, and rectum is spectinomycin in nonpregnant women (not available in the United States) in a single IM dose or single doses of cephalosporins (ceftizoxime or cefoxitin, administered with ''probenecid'' (Benemid), or cefotaxime).''Treatment should always include medication that will treat ''chlamydia'' [for example, ''azithromycin'' (''Zithromax'', ''Zmax'') or ''doxycycline'' (''Vibramycin'', ''Oracea'', ''Adoxa'', ''Atridox'' and others)] as well as gonorrhea, because gonorrhea and chlamydia frequently exist together in the same person. The sexual partners of women who have had either gonorrhea or chlamydia must receive treatment for both infections since their sex partners may be infected as well. Treating the sex partners also prevents reinfection of the woman. Women suffering from PID require more aggressive treatment that is effective against the bacteria that cause gonorrhea as well as against other organisms. These women often require hospitalization and intravenous administration of antibiotics.''It is important to note that doxycycline, one of the recommended ''drugs'' for treatment of PID, is not recommended for use in ''pregnant'' women.''Gonorrhea is one of the easier STIs to prevent because the bacterium that causes the infection can survive only under certain conditions. The use of condoms protects against gonorrhea infection. Since the organism can live in the throat, condoms should be used during oral-genital contact as well.' "
What is the digestive system?,"'The energy required for all the processes and activities that take place in our bodies is derived from the foods we ingest. The digestive system allows us to utilize food from such diverse sources as meat from an animal and the roots of a plant, and utilize them as an energy source. Whether it is the ability to coordinate the chewing of the food without injuring our tongue and lips or the propulsion of the food from the stomach into the duodenum while releasing the appropriate enzymes, our digestive system allows us to manage the process without much thought and often while performing other tasks.'  "
What are the 9 parts and and functions of the digestive system? What does it look like?,"'The process of digestion is a fascinating and complex one that takes the food we place in our mouth and turns it into energy and waste products. This process takes place in the gastrointestinal tract, a long, connected, tubular structure that starts with the mouth and ends with the anus. The food is propelled forward within the system, altered by enzymes and hormones into usable particles and absorbed along the way. Other organs that support the digestive process are the ''liver'', gallbladder, and pancreas. The time it takes for food to travel from entering the mouth to be excreted as waste is around 30 to 40 hours.' "
The mouth,"'The mouth is the entry point for food, but the digestive system often gets ready before the first piece of food even enters our mouth. Saliva is released by the salivary glands into our oral ''cavity'' when we smell food. Once the food enters the mouth, chewing (mastication) breaks food into smaller particles that can be more easily attacked by the enzymes in saliva. Our ''teeth'' can perform a cutting as well as grinding function to accomplish this task. The tongue assists in mixing the food with the saliva and then the tongue and roof of the mouth (soft palate) help move the food along to the pharynx and ''esophagus''.' "
The pharynx and esophagus,"'The pharynx (throat) is the transition area from the mouth to the esophagus. From the pharynx there are two paths that the food bolus can take; 1) the wrong path, which is down the windpipe into the ''lungs'', or 2) the correct path into the esophagus and then the stomach. The act of swallowing is a complex process that closes the windpipe (to protect our lungs) and moves food into the esophagus. This process is mostly automatic (reflex) but it is also partially under our direct control.''Once it enters the esophagus, food is moved down the esophagus and into our stomach. The esophagus is a muscular tube that contracts in a synchronized fashion (peristalsis) to move food down towards the stomach. While the muscles behind the food product contract, the muscles ahead of the food relax, causing the forward propulsion of the food. Peristalsis is the main mechanism by which food moves through our digestive system.''Once the food approaches the stomach, a muscular valve (the lower esophageal sphincter) relaxes and lets the food pass into the stomach. This sphincter has the important function of closing the stomach so no food or stomach acid reenters the esophagus (and therefore avoiding ''heartburn'' or regurgitation).' "
The stomach and small intestine,"'From glands that line the stomach, acid and enzymes are secreted that continue the breakdown process of the food. The stomach muscles further mix the food. At the end of this process, the food you placed in your mouth has been transformed to a thick creamy fluid called chyme.''This thick fluid is then pushed into the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). With the help of enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver, further breakdown of the food occurs in the small intestine.''The small intestine has three segments. The first segment is the duodenum where further breakdown of the food takes place. The next two parts of the small intestine (jejunum and ileum) are mostly responsible for the absorption of nutrients from the processed food into the bloodstream through the walls of the intestine.''After the small intestine, the leftover waste leaves the upper gastrointestinal tract (upper GI tract) which is made up of everything above the ''large intestine'', and moves into the large intestine or colon (the beginning of the ''lower GI'' tract).' "
"The colon, rectum, and anus","'The role of the lower GI tract is to solidify the waste product (by absorbing water), store the waste product until it can be evacuated (going to the bathroom) and help with the evacuation process.''The large intestine (colon) has four parts:''All together the colon is approximately 7 ''feet'' long and connects to the rectum. Here as in most other parts of the GI system, the waste product is moved along by peristalsis. As the waste product passes through the colon, water is absorbed and ''stool'' is formed.''The ''stool'' from the colon is stored in the rectum. The anal sphincter provides the control over releasing stool or holding it. Once stool arrives in the rectum, a feedback to the brain makes the person aware of the need for a bowel movement. Voluntary control over the anal sphincter lets us hold the stool until we go to the toilet.' ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid colon."
"Three accessory digestive organs (pancreas, liver, gallbladder)","'Three other organs are instrumental in the digestive process.' Pancreas: Although the pancreas is mostly known for its blood sugar regulatory function with the production of insulin (as part of the endocrine system -- he insulin goesdirectly from the gland into the bloodstream), it is the main producer of digestive enzymes as part of the exocrine system (the enzymes produced by the gland pass through a duct into the intestines). These enzymes are released into the duodenum and help with the digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.. Liver: The liver produces bile for fat digestion and elimination. In addition, nutrients are stored in the liver, and toxins and chemicals are filtered by liver. Gallbladder: Bile is stored and released from the gallbladder. When fatty food enters the duodenum, the gallbladder contracts and releases bile."
Who is at high risk for prostate cancer?,"'All men are at risk for prostate ''cancer''. Thirteen out of every 100 American men will get prostate cancer, and about two to three men will die from it.''The most common risk factor is age. As the age advances, the risk of a man getting prostate cancer increases.\xa0''Other factors that put a man at high risk for prostate cancer include:''The effects of several risk factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer are not clear, although a small number of studies have suggested their association with prostate cancer. These include:' African American men: They are more than twice as likely to die from prostate cancer as white men and tend to get prostate cancer at a younger age. Family history of prostate cancer: Men who have a father, brother, or son diagnosed with or with a history of prostate cancer have a greater risk of getting prostate cancer. Genetic makeup: Men with inherited mutations of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes or with Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, or HNPCC) Inflammation of the prostate (Prostatitis) Excess of calcium in diet or through supplements Obesity Smoking Exposure to certain chemicals (evidence shows increased incidence in firefighters who are exposed to toxins released by fire)"
How is a prostate cancer screening done?,"'Screening for prostate cancer'' means finding out if someone has cancer before the ''cancer causes'' symptoms. When detected early, it can be treated before it spreads to other organs.''There is no standard screening test for prostate cancer. ''Prostate cancer screening'' is done using the following tests:''Digital rectal examination (DRE):'' This test is done at the doctor’s clinic. The doctor inserts his finger into your anus and reaches till your rectum to feel for any cancerous growth in your prostate.''Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test:'' This is a blood test that measures the blood levels of PSA, a substance made by your prostate. The higher levels of PSA are suggestive of cancer. But there are other conditions as well when PSA levels are high. If your doctor suspects cancer, they might order for a biopsy of the prostate.' "
How can I prevent prostate problems naturally?,"'There is no sure way to prevent prostate problems such as prostate cancer. Many risk factors such as age, race, and family history can’t be controlled. But some of the studies suggest a few ways that can help keep the prostate healthy and prevent prostate cancer naturally. These include:''Some early studies had suggested that taking ''vitamin E'' or selenium supplements might lower prostate cancer risk. But a larger study (SELECT) conducted later found that they are of no use in preventing prostate cancer. Hence, you need to discuss with your doctor before you start taking any such supplements.' Keep your weight under control Stay physically active Follow a healthy eating pattern that includes A variety of colorful fruits and vegetables and whole grains Healthy fats, such as olive oil, nuts, and avocados. Avoid or limit the consumption of red meat (such as beef, pork, lamb, and goat) and processed meats (such as bologna and hot dogs), sugar-sweetened beverages (like sodas), fast foods, and packaged foods Cutting down on salt Being watchful of how much you eat to avoid overeating (stop eating when you are full) Limit calcium supplements and to not get too much calcium in the diet Soy and isoflavones in foods or as supplements"
What causes mouth cancer?,"'Researchers have suggested that mouth cancers arise from cells in the oral cavity, which undergo DNA mutations (a permanent change in the DNA sequence). The mutations cause the cells to grow and divide rapidly and abnormally. The exact cause of the DNA mutations in cells is not known, but certain factors increase the risk of developing ''cancer''. They are' Tobacco in any form (chewing tobacco, smoking cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and snuff), significantly increases the risk of oral cancer Heavy alcohol consumption Age: The risk for mouth cancer increases with age and is more common after the age of 60 years Sun exposure: Excessive sun exposure can increase the risk of mouth cancer developing from the lips Sex: Men are two times more likely than women to develop mouth cancer Human papillomavirus (HPV): The virus is usually sexually transmitted, and certain strains of HPV increases the risk of mouth cancer A weak immune system due to conditions like HIV, malnutrition, etc. Sharp tooth, causing chronic trauma and irritation to the buccal mucosa or tongue Poor dental hygiene"
How is mouth cancer treated?,"'Treatment of mouth cancer depends on the location and stage of cancer. Treatment may involve one or a combination of treatment modalities.''Treatment options include:' Surgery: If the tumor is localized, the surgeon may only remove the tumor with a margin of normal tissue surrounding the tumor. If the tumor has spread to other parts of the head and neck, the lymph nodes and affected tissues may be removed. If a significant part of the tissue has been removed, leaving a defect, reconstructive surgery would be performed by the surgeon. Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy involves using high-energy radiation beams like X-rays to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy: Chemotherapy involves using chemicals to kill cancer cells. Targeted drug therapy: Targeted drugs alter certain proteins of the cancer cells that affect their growth and cause the death of the cancer cell. Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy uses the patient’s immune system to fight cancer cells."
Can mouth cancer be prevented?,"'It may not always be possible to prevent ''oral cancer'' just like any other cancer. Some lifestyle modifications can reduce the risk of oral cancer, such as:' Avoiding tobacco consumption in any form Limiting the consumption of alcohol Having a healthy, nutritious diet and exercising regularly Applying sunblock all over the face and neck. The lips should be protected by using a lip balm with sunscreen. Maintaining good oral hygiene Treatment of sharp tooth Visiting the dentist regularly to ensure oral health"
How to cope with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic? ,"'The ''COVID-19'' outbreak has certainly likely brought many changes in your daily routines and your professional life. Many of you are worried about the financial pressures and some must be feeling lonely due to social isolation.\xa0''A self-report survey was conducted on 3304 participants in the US and Canada over the internet between March 21 and April 1, 2020. The survey found that the ''COVID-19'' pandemic is making people:''Thinking repeatedly about these things during the COVID-19 pandemic can make you anxious, fearful, and sad.\xa0 Here are a few tips to keep yourself calm during any kind of stress, especially during the COVID-19 outbreak:''If you are unable to deal with the stress by yourself, do not hesitate to seek help from a professional ''mental health'' therapist.' Fear of dangerousness of COVID-19 Fear of coming into contact with the objects (fomites) that are contaminated with the virus Constant worry about personal finances and disruption in the supply chain Get frequent nightmares, intrusive thoughts, or images related to COVID-19 Stay physically active. Whether you hit the gym or do your workout at home, it is always helpful to keep moving to improve your mood. Take a walk: Get outside in an area and walk while wearing a mask and maintaining a safe distance from people— as recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) or your government. This can be a nature trail or in your backyard. Get adequate sleep. Try to get at least seven hours of sleep daily.  Eat healthy, well-balanced meals. Choose unprocessed foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains instead of over-processed foods. The food you eat may affect the way you think about a stressful situation. Limit exposure to media. Constant news about COVID-19 from channels such as the press and social media can make you fearful and anxious. Look for credible sources such as the CDC and WHO. Avoid smoking, drinking, and taking recreational drugs. Smoking is already known for being a risk factor for lung disease. Alcohol and drugs can make coping with stress more difficult.  Limit your screen time. Make sure to not overdo entertaining activities such as watching TV or being on your smartphone for prolonged hours. This can indirectly contribute to stress. Relax and re-energize yourself. Take out some time for yourself and try staying quiet for some time, imagine peaceful or serene places, meditate or do yoga. Any activity that unwinds you will do. Stay connected. Reach out to people close to you such as your family and friends when the stress is driving you nuts. You can connect with them over the phone, email, social media, or chatting apps."
What does ALS do to your body?,"'ALS belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases (MND). The disease causes gradual damage to the nerve cells (motor neurons).\xa0''Motor neurons extend from the brain to the spinal cord and to muscles throughout the body. They are responsible for carrying messages between the brain, spinal cord, and the voluntary muscles that help you do various tasks such as grasping objects, talking, eating, dressing up, and moving around. In ALS, the death of these neurons stops the transfer of messages from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles.''The disease has a progressive and fatal course. In absence of the control from the nerves, the muscles stay unused and gradually weaken, twitch (fasciculations), and waste away (atrophy). It ultimately causes the brain to lose its ability to initiate and control voluntary movements. There is a \xa0progressive decline in the ability to talk, write, pick up or hold things, swallow, and breathe.\xa0''There is no cure for ALS. People with this disease have a shortened life expectancy and may die within a few years of diagnosis. ALS most commonly affects white people, males, and people over age 60.\xa0' "
How is ALS diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of ALS is based on a detailed history of the symptoms and signs observed by a doctor during a physical examination, along with various tests to rule out other mimicking diseases.\xa0''Your doctor may request certain tests which include:' Genetic testing (may point to a mutation in cases of familial ALS) Muscle and imaging tests including MRI, electromyography (EMG), and nerve conduction studies (NCS) Blood tests Urine examination Tests for other medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis, HIV, polio, and other viral infections"
What are the risk factors for developing the cancer of testis?	,"'The various factors that may increase the risk of the ''cancer of the testis'' are:''Many men may develop cancer in absence of risk factors. Conversely, some men with risk factors may not develop cancer. It must be remembered that the cancer of testis is an uncommon and a slow-growing tumor. It has more than 90% survival rate with tumors that have spread locally and more than 73% survival rates with tumors that have spread throughout the body. Early diagnosis and timely treatment are keys to survival.' Undescended testis: This is the major risk factor for the development of testicular cancer. Normally, the testis is inside the child’s belly during the intrauterine life. They descend to the scrotum at birth or just after birth. In some persons, one or both testes fail to descend from the belly to the scrotum even after birth. Sometimes, the testis may start descending but get stuck in the groin. Such undescended testis may require a surgical procedure called orchiopexy to pull it down and fix it in the scrotum. It is best done before the child’s first birthday. Early orchiopexy helps to reduce the risk of cancer in a person, but if it can completely prevent the development of cancer is yet being studied. HIV/AIDS infection: The risk of testicular cancer is higher in individuals infected with HIV. History of testicular cancer in past: Having a tumor of one testis in the past increases the risk of cancer of the other testis in the future. Ethnicity: Testicular cancer is higher in the white population compared to the black or Asian population. It is also slightly higher in taller men. Family history of testicular cancer: If your father or brother has had a history of testis cancer, you may be at an increased risk. Genetic factors: Individuals with Klinefelter syndrome (a genetic condition in which a male is born with an extra copy of the X chromosome) are at risk of cancer of the testis. Age: Men who are 20-39 years of age are prone to testicular cancer. Toxins: A toxin called Ochratoxin A is produced by a fungus that infects plants that bear nuts, spices, or coffee. Consumption of the mold-infested food may cause cancer of the testis in some men. The role of intrauterine exposure to this toxin via the mother’s diet or exposure to this toxin via breast milk in causing testicular cancer is also being studied."
What is the military diet?,"'The military ''diet'' or the 3-day ''diet'' is one of the most popular weight-loss diets. Dating back to 1985, this fad diet claims a ''weight loss'' of about 10 pounds or 4.5 kgs in a week. The diet makes robust claims of faster and significant ''weight loss'', detox, lowered ''cholesterol'', and increased energy. None of these claims, however, have been scientifically substantiated. Although called the ‘military diet,’ the diet is not affiliated with any military or government institution. The advocates of this diet, however, claim that it was used by the American military for the soldiers to get in shape.''The diet constitutes a 3-day diet plan (on days) that provide between 800-1100 calories. This is followed by 4 days off when a person eats their normal diet. It is advised to have a diet providing 1300 to 1500 calories even on the 4 ‘off’ days. The diet also offers a suggested meal plan for the 4 off days. The diet pattern can be followed multiple times until the desired weight is achieved.' "

Facts you should know about hormonal methods of birth control,"'If a woman is sexually active and she is ''fertile'', meaning that she is physically able to become ''pregnant'', she needs to ask herself, ""Do I want to become pregnant now?"" If her answer is ""No,"" she must use some method of ''birth control'' (''contraception'').''Terminology for ""''birth control''"" includes contraception, ''pregnancy'' ''prevention'', ''fertility'' control, and ''family planning''. But no matter what the terminology, sexually active people can choose from a variety of methods to reduce the possibility of their ''becoming pregnant''. Nevertheless, no method of birth control available today offers perfect protection against sexually transmitted infections (''sexually transmitted diseases'', or ''STDs''), except abstinence.'""In simple terms, all methods of birth control are based on either preventing a man's sperm from reaching and entering a woman's egg (""'fertilization'"") or preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the woman's uterus (her womb) and starting to grow. New methods of birth control are being developed and tested. And what is appropriate for a couple at one point may change with time and circumstances.""'Unfortunately, no birth-control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.' "
Types of hormonal methods of contraception,"'There are several different hormonal methods of birth control. The differences among them involve''The hormones can be estrogen and/or ''progesterone'', or preparations that contain a combination of these hormones. These hormones may be taken orally (taken by mouth), implanted into body tissue, injected under the skin, absorbed from a patch on the skin, or placed in the vagina. The mode of delivery determines whether the hormonal exposure is continuous or intermittent.'  the type of hormone, the amount of hormone, and the way the hormone enters a woman's body."
What are advantages and disadvantages of hormonal birth control methods?,"'Advantages of hormonal methods of birth control include that they are all highly effective and their effects are reversible. They do not rely on spontaneity and can be used in advance of sexual activity.''Disadvantages of hormonal methods for birth control include:' The necessity of taking medications continuously The cost of the medications Women must remember to take them regularly or use them exactly as prescribed A doctor’s visit and prescription are required. They do not protect a woman against STDs or sexually transmitted diseases Women must begin using hormonal contraceptives in advance before they become effective. For some women, hormonal preparations are associated with unpleasant side effects or increased health risks."
Oral hormones: The pill,"'The combination pill '""contains the hormones estrogen and progestin, a form of progesterone. When a woman uses the combination pill, the eggs in her ovaries do not mature and she does not ovulate. She doesn't become pregnant because no egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.""'The traditional combination pill comes in 21-day packs or 28-day packs depending on the manufacturer. The 21-pill pack has pills for 21 ""on"" days and no pills for the 7 ""off"" days that follow. The 28-pill pack has active pills for the first 21 ""on"" days and seven inactive (placebo) or reminder pills for the following 7 ""off"" days.''New preparations have been developed that allow for extended or continuous use of combination pills for months at a time. These products allow for a reduction in the number of menstrual periods a woman experiences.''The minipill'' only contains one hormone, progestin. Progestin thickens the cervical ''mucus'', making it more difficult for sperm to pass through the cervix. It also makes the lining of the uterus less receptive to the implantation of a fertilized egg. The progesterone-only pill is sometimes recommended for women who have medical reasons for which they must avoid taking estrogen hormones. (These reasons can include ''liver disease'', certain types of ''blood clots'' in the veins, ''breast cancer'', and ''uterine cancer''.) In addition, it is often recommended in ''nursing'' mothers because it has no adverse effects on ''breastfeeding''. Indeed, extended breastfeeding, as well as delay in the need for formula supplementation has been observed in breastfeeding users of the minipill.''The minipill is taken every day. There are no ""on"" or ""off"" days with the minipill.' "
What are the side effects of the pill?,"'Most side effects from the combination pill or the minipill decrease after two to three months of use. It is important to remember that because most side effects of oral contraceptives decrease in the first two to three months of use, women should try to avoid switching pills prior to an adequate trial. Trying to stick with any given product for two to three months may be necessary to really determine whether or not it will be tolerated over time. Switching too early to another brand may only needlessly subject the woman to the possibility of similar side effects starting all over again with the new pill.''There is no increased risk of ''birth defects'' in ''babies'' born to women who have taken the pill, but a woman should not use either type of pill if she is pregnant.''A woman who is breastfeeding should not use the combination pill because it can reduce the amount of her ''breast milk'' and the concentration of proteins and fat in her breast milk. Additionally, her breast milk will contain traces of the hormones from the pill. However, in contrast to the combination pill, the minipill is routinely used in lactating women.''Women who smoke and take the pill are at increased risk of ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''. There is no increased risk of ''heart attack'' or ''stroke'' among healthy nonsmoking women who use the pill.''Blood clots in the legs (''DVT'') and elsewhere are slightly more frequent with low-dose oral contraceptives, but the risk is very low, and lower than the increased risk of clotting that occurs with pregnancy. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives are ''not'' recommended for:''Smokers'' over 35 years of age should not use oral contraceptives, nor should women with a significant ''liver'' disorder.''A woman should contact her healthcare professional immediately if she experiences any of these side effects while taking the pill:' Some women experience temporary symptoms of spotting or light vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness, and nausea during the first one to three months of taking the pill. Nausea can be helped if the pill is taken after a meal. While women sometimes fear weight gain with oral contraceptives, studies of the low-dose preparations demonstrate that there is no significant weight gain with oral contraception and no major difference in weight change comparing various contraception products. Negative mood changes, such as depression, and pigmented patches of skin on the face (melasma) may occur with oral-contraceptive use. Because the progesterone in women can cause thinning of the lining of the uterus, some women may experience loss of menstrual periods (amenorrhea). Oral contraceptive-induced amenorrhea happens in about 1% of women in the first year of use. As long as the woman is properly taking her pills, amenorrhea is not harmful and it does not signal any loss of effectiveness of the pills. women with clotting tendencies (such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Leiden Factor 5), known coronary heart disease, stroke, unevaluated breast lumps, vaginal bleeding, or breast cancer. severe headache; leg cramps; change in vision, including blurred vision, vision loss, or flashing lights; abdominal pain; chest pain; shortness of breath; coughing up blood; or leg swelling or pain."
How is the pill taken?,"'No matter which type of birth-control pill a woman uses, she should take it every day at the same time in order to establish a routine. The woman needs to minimize the chance she will forget to take the pill, which is not an uncommon occurrence. This is especially critical in the case of the progestin-only pill (minipill). Forgetting to take the minipill, or taking it at varying times of the day, can significantly impair its effectiveness in contraception. This is due to the low dose of the minipill causing its effects to wear off rapidly if the pill is missed.' "
How long will it take before the pill prevents conception?," When a woman begins taking the pill, she may not be protected from pregnancy until she has been taking the pill for 10 consecutive days in a row. If a woman forgets to take a pill after she has started, she may be at risk for getting pregnant. If she only misses one pill, she should take it as soon as she remembers, even if it means taking two pills in the same day. If she misses two pills, she should take both of them as soon as she remembers, plus the pill for that day at her regular time. If she misses three pills, she should discontinue use of the pill for 4 more days to complete one week and then begin taking a new pack of birth control pills, whether she has a menstrual period or not. She must use an alternate form of birth control or abstain from sexual activity during the week that she stops taking her pills. If a woman continually forgets to take her pills, perhaps she should consider a different method of birth control."
What drugs or conditions reduce the effectiveness of the pill?,"'A woman should ask her healthcare professional about these matters and the necessity of using a backup method of birth control if any of these conditions exist.' The pill may partially lose its effectiveness if a woman vomits or has diarrhea for any reason. Some medications, including certain sedatives and some antibiotics such as penicillin and tetracycline, may reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Research in this area is ongoing."
What are the benefits of taking the pill?,"""There are a number of benefits to taking the pill. Both the combination pill and the minipill can regularize a woman's ""'menstrual cycle'' and reduce her menstrual flow and ''menstrual cramps''. There is evidence that the pill protects against ''cancer of the ovary'' and uterus as well as ''pelvic inflammatory disease'' (PID) and ''iron deficiency anemia''.''The combination pill can reduce:''According to several studies, the combination pill confers no long-term risk of ''breast cancer'' for women at average risk. In addition, a woman who has taken the pill is less likely to develop ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and ''osteoporosis''.''Users of oral contraceptives have experienced significant decreases in excessive menstrual flow and in occurrence and severity of ''menstrual cramps''.' acne (although maximal acne reduction may take six months to occur), the risk of an ectopic pregnancy, noncancerous breast cysts, and ovarian cysts."
When will I start having periods again after I quit taking the pill?," A woman's menstrual periods should begin again within about 3 months of stopping the oral-contraceptive pill. However, the length of delay before a woman's period returns after stopping the pill varies from woman to woman. Oral contraceptives are about 97% effective in preventing pregnancy. The pill does not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections."
Injection: depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA),"'Depot ''medroxyprogesterone'' acetate  (DMPA) is a synthetic long-acting form of the hormone progesterone. DMPA is similar to the birth-control minipill in that it does not contain estrogen. Like other progesterone-based contraceptives, DMPA acts by preventing the release of the egg from the ovary (''ovulation'"") and by promoting thick cervical mucus that impedes the sperm's progress. Its effectiveness in preventing pregnancy is close to 100%.""""DMPA must be injected by a health care professional every three months (12 weeks). It is administered as a deep muscle (intramuscular) injection. A lower-dose formulation of the drug that is injected beneath the skin (subcutaneously) is also available. The injection must be administered within the first 5 days of a woman's menstrual period. She is then protected from pregnancy within 24 hours of receiving the injection.""'A woman may stop having periods altogether after using DMPA for one year. After two years of use, 70% of women will have no menstrual bleeding. Menstrual periods stop because the DMPA causes the ovaries to go into a ""resting"" state. When the ovaries do not release an egg every month, the regular growth of the lining of the uterus does not occur and no uterine lining is shed during the subsequent menstrual cycle.'""A woman's menstrual periods should begin again within six to 18 months after she stops taking the injections. A woman can also become pregnant, usually within 12 to 18 months, once she stops using DMPA. If a new mother does not breastfeed her baby, she can resume the injections right after ""'childbirth''. Mothers who are breastfeeding can safely begin the injections six weeks after ''childbirth''. The injections do not reduce the flow of her breast milk, and no harmful effects on the baby have been noted.''The most common side effects of DMPA injections are irregular menstrual cycles, cessation of menstrual periods, and weight gain. Other side effects may include nervousness, ''dizziness'', stomach discomfort, ''headaches'', ''fatigue'', or breast tenderness. It is important that a woman realize that once she has been injected with DMPA, any side effects she may experience cannot be neutralized or eliminated. She has to tolerate these side effects until the medication wears off, typically three months later.''DMPA has also been shown to have a negative effect on ''bone mineral density'', especially with longer-term use; however, studies have shown that her previous ''bone density'' is usually restored when the drug is discontinued.''Women may be able to use DMPA when avoidance of estrogen is prudent for medical reasons (see oral contraceptives). A qualified health care provider should be able to help make the proper distinction. DMPA should not be used by women who have a history of breast ''cancer'', blood clots, ''liver disease'', unexplained vaginal bleeding, or ''stroke''. A woman on DMPA should contact her health care professional if she experiences a heavy menstrual flow, severe ''abdominal pain'', ''headaches'', or ''depression''.'""DMPA injections are over 99% effective if the injections are received according to the correct schedule. A woman using injection contraceptives has the advantage of being capable of becoming pregnant at a later time, if desired, simply by discontinuing use. DMPA does not increase a woman's risk of ""'cancer'', including breast ''cancer'', and greatly reduces her risk of developing uterine cancer.''Injectable hormonal contraceptives do not protect against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Contraceptive patch: Ortho-Evra,"'An adhesive patch has been developed that provides hormonal contraception through the skin, which is known as a transdermal (through the skin) delivery system. The patch is about the size of a half-dollar and can be worn on the arm, abdomen, or buttocks. A woman wears the patch for a week and then replaces it with a new patch.''These patches are called Ortho-Evra (ethinyl ''estradiol''/norelgestromin patch-topical), and are similar to the pill in that they contain both estrogen and progesterone. Ortho-Evra should be just as effective in preventing pregnancy as the pill. Ortho-Evra is similar to the pill in that it suppresses ovulation and has the advantage of improved compliance and convenience due to weekly administration. A woman only needs to remember to replace the patch once a week instead of being required to remember taking a pill every day. However, some studies have shown that the contraceptive patch may be associated with a greater risk of negative side effects, such as blood-clotting problems, than oral contraceptive pills.''Women who have medical reasons why oral contraceptives are not recommended (such as already having an underlying tendency toward blood clotting) may find that their prescribing physician also recommends against Ortho-Evra because of the similarity in the hormone ingredients of both types of contraceptives.'""It is important to ensure that the patch makes good contact with the skin. The patch could be a problem for those women who perspire heavily, swim, and/or take frequent showers because moisture can interfere with the patch's contact with the skin. Some women may also experience skin irritation at the site of the patch. Furthermore, contraceptive failure may be a risk in heavier women (those who weigh over 198 pounds, or 90 kilograms).""'As with all other hormonal methods of birth control, the patch will not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Contraceptive implants,"'A contraceptive implant known as Implanon is available in the U.S. Implanon provides contraception by the slow release of the progestin etonogestrel over a period of three years. Implanon is a thin rod that is inserted in the upper arm under local anesthesia. Protection from pregnancy occurs within 24 hours of insertion of the rod, and the failure rate is comparable with surgical sterilization (tubal ligations). One advantage of the Implanon rod is that fertility rapidly returns after removal of the rod.''A two-rod implant containing the progestin ''levonorgestrel'' (Jadelle) was approved by the FDA for 5 years of use, although it has not been marketed in the United States. Similarly, the Sino-Implant II contraceptive implant is similar to Jadelle, but is designed to remain in place for 4 years.''Preliminary studies of the product showed that it was generally well tolerated and effective in preventing pregnancy. However, these studies showed that irregular bleeding is a possible side effect of the product.''As with all other hormonal methods of birth control, Implanon will not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Vaginal ring: NuvaRing,"'A ring-shaped device that contains the hormones estradiol and etonogestrel (a progestin) can be placed in the vagina. It remains in place for three weeks continuously, then it is removed for one week to allow for a menstrual period. It continuously releases low levels of the hormone into the bloodstream for the entire three weeks.'' There is currently one brand available in the U.S., ''NuvaRing'' (etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol-vaginal ring). It is about 99% effective in preventing pregnancy, having the same high effectiveness as the other hormonal methods of contraception. The incidence of hormone-related side effects is similar to those seen with other hormonal contraceptive methods such as the pill and the patch. ''Vaginal discharge'' can sometimes occur as a side effect of the ring preparation.''NuvaRing does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.' "
How effective are hormonal birth control methods?,"'Hormonal methods of birth control are some of the most effective forms of birth control available. When used properly, their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy can approach 99%-100%. With typical use of ''birth control pills'', effectiveness is estimated to be about 95%. With any form of hormonal contraception, precisely following instructions for proper use will increase its effectiveness.' "
What is atrial fibrillation?,"'Atrial fibrillation'' (AFib or AF) refers to abnormal heart rhythm (''arrhythmia'') that causes quivering or irregular heartbeats. It is a serious medical condition that may further lead to ''stroke'' and ''heart failure''. The heart is a muscular organ roughly the size of a closed fist. It has two upper chambers called atria and two lower chambers called ventricles. The flow of blood into the heart, within the heart chambers, and from the heart is guarded by the four valves present in the heart. The heart gets its nutrients and oxygen through the coronary arteries that run along the surface of the heart. It is also richly supplied by a web of nerve tissue that facilitates the rhythmic heartbeat. A regular, well-coordinated heartbeat is essential for the heart to do its job: pump blood effectively throughout the body. Electrical signals travel through the heart to cause rhythmic contractions and relaxation of its chambers. Normally, the heart beats around 60-100 times a minute. This regular heartbeat is called sinus rhythm. AFib is a condition in which the electrical signals in the heart become chaotic. This results in the twitching or quivering of the atria that becomes unable to pump blood effectively into the ventricles. Contractions are not coordinated and result in an irregular and abnormally fast heart rate. This abnormally fast rhythm may cause a ''blood clot'' to break off and travel to the brain causing a ''stroke''. Untreated AFib may increase the risk of ''stroke'' by five times. It can also make the heart weak leading to heart failure, which is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the demands of the body. Despite all the potential risks associated with AFib, many people are not aware that it is a serious condition.' "
What are the symptoms of atrial fibrillation?,"'The ''symptoms of atrial fibrillation'' (AFib) include:' Palpitations (an irregular, rapid, or pounding heartbeat) Feeling excessively tired A fluttering or thumping sensation in the chest Dizziness or fainting episodes Confusion Shortness of breath  Anxiety General weakness Decreased stamina or ability to exercise  Sweating Chest pain or pressure"
What is surgical airway management?,'Surgical ''airway'' management involves the creation of an airway using surgical techniques. Surgical airway management is often performed\xa0' In unstable patients In case of stable patients who cannot be intubated or ventilated
What are the most common surgical airway techniques?,"'The four distinct but related most common surgical airway techniques include the following:''Cricothyroid is a small, two-sided membrane found in the neck (Adam’s apple). Mostly, cricothyrotomy is preferred over tracheostomy because of its ease, speed, and lower complication rate.\xa0''For children younger than 12 years, needle cricothyroidotomy is the preferred choice of surgical airway management.\xa0' Open cricothyroidotomy Needle cricothyroidotomy with jet oxygenation Percutaneous cricothyroidotomy using the Seldinger technique Surgical tracheostomy (an incision in the windpipe made to relieve an obstruction to breathing)"
When should be surgical airway management avoided?,'Surgical airway management should be avoided in patients in the following conditions:' Previous neck surgery Disrupted airway Previous radiation therapy Tumors in the larynx or trachea Obesity Blood clot or pus accumulation in the neck Presence of a short neck
How is surgical airway management performed?,"'The different surgical airway management has been explained below:' The patient is made to lie flat on the table.  The physician then cleans the patient’s neck using antiseptic swabs and applies local anesthesia to the neck.  The physician then locates the cricothyroid membrane. Next, the physician makes an incision through the skin.  The physician then inserts a tracheal hook through the opening and hooks the tail end of the opening.  The physician then lifts the opening and inserts a tube with a cuff attached.  The physician inflates the cuff and checks for chest rise.  Finally, the physician secures the airway. In this technique, the physician penetrates the site with a needle.  An incision can be made to direct the needle.  A needle is used to aspirate the air to check if the air can enter the syringe from the tracheal tree.  The physician passes a catheter (tube) over the needle. This technique is similar to needle cricothyroidotomy, but with certain modifications.  After inserting the needle, the physician advances the guidewire through the syringe toward the airway.  Before removing the needle, the physician enlarges the opening to insert a dilator airway tube device over the guidewire.  Once the airway device is in place, the physician removes the dilator and guidewire."
What are the complications of surgical airway management?,'The complications of different techniques are stated below.''Open cricothyroidotomy:''Needle cricothyroidotomy:' Aspiration (inhalation of foreign materials into the lungs) Bleeding Blood clots Esophagus or trachea tear Injury to the voice cord Mediastinum emphysema (trapped surrounding the heart and central blood vessels) Narrowing of the larynx Creation of false passage into the adjacent tissue Inadequate ventilation Aspiration (inhalation of blood into the lungs) Esophagus tear Hole in the wall of the trachea Hole in the thyroid Hypercarbia (excess amount of oxygen in the bloodstream) Subcutaneous emphysema (trapped air in the tissue beneath the skin)
What is hepatic encephalopathy?,"'Hepatic encephalopathy'' (HE), or portosystemic ''encephalopathy'' or PSE, is a condition that causes worsening of brain function in people with advanced ''liver disease''. When the liver is damaged, it can no longer remove toxic substances from the blood. These toxins may reach the brain and cause the brain cells to swell. This hampers brain function.''HE is classified into three types:''The stages of HE include the following:\xa0' Type A: It is associated with acute liver failure. Type B: It occurs when there is no primary liver damage, and encephalopathy occurs due to the portosystemic shunting of the blood (an abnormal vein that bypasses blood purification by liver bypassing called shunting). Portosystemic shunts can be either congenital (present at birth) or acquired. Type C: It is an encephalopathy associated with severe liver disease or severe liver damage. Encephalopathy can either be episodic (acute) or persistent (chronic). Grade 0 (Minimal): Difficult to detect clinically; subtle impairment in memory, concentration, and intellectual functions. Slight impairment of coordination such as poor work performance or ability to drive (incidences of traffic violations while driving) Grade 1 (Mild): Presence of mood changes, depression, irritability, a decreased attention span, and sleep issues Grade 2 (Moderate): Associated with increasing forgetfulness, slurred speech, inappropriate behavior, inability to do simple mental tasks such as basic math, shaking of hands, and writing difficulties Grade 3 (Severe): Characterized by marked sleepiness, disoriented in space and time, extreme anxiety, and strange behavior Grade 4 (Coma): Patient loses consciousness and passes into a comatose state."
What are the common causes of hepatic encephalopathy?,"'Patients may not have a definite cause of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), but the most common causes of HE include:' Excessive alcohol intake Intake of large amounts of protein in persons with a damaged liver Liver cirrhosis (a condition where there is scarring of the liver tissue) due to various causes Fulminant hepatitis due to hepatitis viruses Overdosing of drugs such as paracetamol, painkillers, water pills, or sleeping drugs Severe infections called sepsis Multiple organ failure"
How is hepatic encephalopathy treated?,"'Understanding the cause of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) paves the way to treat HE. If pre-existing conditions are treated, the occurrence of HE may be reduced. The doctor may suggest a few drugs and therapies that may reduce the toxins in the body:' Lactulose: This helps cut down ammonia formation from the stools. Less ammonia means less toxic products in the brain. Antibiotics: Drugs such as rifaximin, neomycin/paromomycin/metronidazole, or vancomycin may help. They curb the gut bacteria that create toxins when they digest food. Patients may be started on zinc therapy: As per some research, zinc deficiency has been shown to cause a disturbance in the levels of neurotransmitters such as GABA and norepinephrine. Zinc might increase the key enzymes in the urea cycle, which favors the conversion of ammonia to urea and subsequent excretion in the urine. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and HE may be given thiamine (Vitamin B1 supplements). L-ornithine and L-aspartate preparation (LOLA) increases the use of ammonia in the urea cycle to produce urea. Probiotics or friendly bacteria can change the balance of bacteria in the intestines, increasing the proportion of friendly bacteria. This can result in decreased levels of ammonia production and other toxic substances. The definitive form of management includes liver transplant to reverse liver dysfunction and the symptoms of HE."
What is the outlook of hepatic encephalopathy?,"'The outlook of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is poor with or without treatment. None of the current treatments are curative, and liver transplant is not readily available for most patients. The current day treatments are to ease symptoms and improve the quality of life. Early identification may be a key because it allows for expeditious identification and management of any precipitating factors.' "
What is fibromyalgia?,"'Fibromyalgia is a condition characterized by widespread pain in the body accompanied by ''tiredness'', sleep, memory lapses, and mood issues.''Symptoms may start after specific events called triggers. These include physical assault, emotional ''trauma'' such as death of a loved one, ''pregnancy'', surgery, or serious illness. Sometimes, there may be no identifiable trigger.''Fibromyalgia is more common in women than in men. Many patients with fibromyalgia may also have other associated conditions such as tension ''headaches'', temporomandibular joint (''TMJ'') disorders, ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS''), ''anxiety'', or ''depression''.''You must discuss the various treatment options for fibromyalgia with your doctor. It is possible improve the symptoms and quality of life with proper management.' "
What causes fibromyalgia?,"'The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but various factors are found to play a role in fibromyalgia. It is thought that chemical imbalance in the brain may cause the person to perceive even “touch” or “poke” as pain. The factors that make you likely for fibromyalgia may include the following:''Risk factors for fibromyalgia are as follows:' Genetics: Fibromyalgia has been found to run in families. There may be certain genetic mutations that increase the risk of this disorder. Infections: Certain systemic illnesses may trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia. Physical or emotional trauma: Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by acute psychological stress or physical trauma such as an accident.  Female sex: Fibromyalgia is more common in women than in men. Family history: A positive family history increases the risk. Other disorders: Other conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus can increase the risk."
How is fibromyalgia diagnosed?,'Your doctor must rely solely on your group of symptoms to make a diagnosis.' Physical assessment by the physician for “tender points” Complete blood analysis to rule out other causes of muscle pain
How is fibromyalgia treated?,"'Treatment options for fibromyalgia are as follows:' Pain killers: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as Tylenol (acetaminophen), Advil (ibuprofen), and prescription painkillers can help reduce symptoms. Narcotics are not usually used because they can lead to dependence and may worsen the pain over time. Antidepressants: Antidepressants such as Cymbalta (duloxetine) or Savella (milnacipran) and muscle relaxants may be prescribed to help reduce pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia.  Antiseizure medication: Medications used to treat epilepsy may be useful in reducing certain types of pain, for example, Lyrica (pregabalin). Physical therapy: A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will improve your strength, flexibility, and stamina. Water-based exercises might be particularly helpful. Occupational therapy: An occupational therapist can help you adjust your work area or the way you perform certain tasks that will cause less stress on your body. Stress management: Managing physical and emotional stress is essential in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Stress management techniques such as deep-breathing exercises, yoga, or meditation can help. Seeking help from a professional therapist may be required. Adequate sleep: Because fatigue is one of the characteristic presentations of fibromyalgia, sufficient rest and practicing good sleep hygiene are essential.  Exercise and diet: Initially, exercise can increase pain, but exercising regularly reduces pain gradually. Exercises may include walking, swimming, biking, water aerobics, yoga, or dance. A physical therapist can help develop an exercise regimen. Eating a healthy, balanced diet and limiting caffeine intake are important in the management of fibromyalgia."
Facts you should know about hormonal methods of birth control,"'If a woman is sexually active and she is ''fertile'', meaning that she is physically able to become ''pregnant'', she needs to ask herself, ""Do I want to become pregnant now?"" If her answer is ""No,"" she must use some method of ''birth control'' (''contraception'').''Terminology for ""''birth control''"" includes contraception, ''pregnancy'' ''prevention'', ''fertility'' control, and ''family planning''. But no matter what the terminology, sexually active people can choose from a variety of methods to reduce the possibility of their ''becoming pregnant''. Nevertheless, no method of birth control available today offers perfect protection against sexually transmitted infections (''sexually transmitted diseases'', or ''STDs''), except abstinence.'""In simple terms, all methods of birth control are based on either preventing a man's sperm from reaching and entering a woman's egg (""'fertilization'"") or preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the woman's uterus (her womb) and starting to grow. New methods of birth control are being developed and tested. And what is appropriate for a couple at one point may change with time and circumstances.""'Unfortunately, no birth-control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.' "
Types of hormonal methods of contraception,"'There are several different hormonal methods of birth control. The differences among them involve''The hormones can be estrogen and/or ''progesterone'', or preparations that contain a combination of these hormones. These hormones may be taken orally (taken by mouth), implanted into body tissue, injected under the skin, absorbed from a patch on the skin, or placed in the vagina. The mode of delivery determines whether the hormonal exposure is continuous or intermittent.'  the type of hormone, the amount of hormone, and the way the hormone enters a woman's body."
What are advantages and disadvantages of hormonal birth control methods?,"'Advantages of hormonal methods of birth control include that they are all highly effective and their effects are reversible. They do not rely on spontaneity and can be used in advance of sexual activity.''Disadvantages of hormonal methods for birth control include:' The necessity of taking medications continuously The cost of the medications Women must remember to take them regularly or use them exactly as prescribed A doctor’s visit and prescription are required. They do not protect a woman against STDs or sexually transmitted diseases Women must begin using hormonal contraceptives in advance before they become effective. For some women, hormonal preparations are associated with unpleasant side effects or increased health risks."
Oral hormones: The pill,"'The combination pill '""contains the hormones estrogen and progestin, a form of progesterone. When a woman uses the combination pill, the eggs in her ovaries do not mature and she does not ovulate. She doesn't become pregnant because no egg is available to be fertilized by a sperm.""'The traditional combination pill comes in 21-day packs or 28-day packs depending on the manufacturer. The 21-pill pack has pills for 21 ""on"" days and no pills for the 7 ""off"" days that follow. The 28-pill pack has active pills for the first 21 ""on"" days and seven inactive (placebo) or reminder pills for the following 7 ""off"" days.''New preparations have been developed that allow for extended or continuous use of combination pills for months at a time. These products allow for a reduction in the number of menstrual periods a woman experiences.''The minipill'' only contains one hormone, progestin. Progestin thickens the cervical ''mucus'', making it more difficult for sperm to pass through the cervix. It also makes the lining of the uterus less receptive to the implantation of a fertilized egg. The progesterone-only pill is sometimes recommended for women who have medical reasons for which they must avoid taking estrogen hormones. (These reasons can include ''liver disease'', certain types of ''blood clots'' in the veins, ''breast cancer'', and ''uterine cancer''.) In addition, it is often recommended in ''nursing'' mothers because it has no adverse effects on ''breastfeeding''. Indeed, extended breastfeeding, as well as delay in the need for formula supplementation has been observed in breastfeeding users of the minipill.''The minipill is taken every day. There are no ""on"" or ""off"" days with the minipill.' "
What are the side effects of the pill?,"'Most side effects from the combination pill or the minipill decrease after two to three months of use. It is important to remember that because most side effects of oral contraceptives decrease in the first two to three months of use, women should try to avoid switching pills prior to an adequate trial. Trying to stick with any given product for two to three months may be necessary to really determine whether or not it will be tolerated over time. Switching too early to another brand may only needlessly subject the woman to the possibility of similar side effects starting all over again with the new pill.''There is no increased risk of ''birth defects'' in ''babies'' born to women who have taken the pill, but a woman should not use either type of pill if she is pregnant.''A woman who is breastfeeding should not use the combination pill because it can reduce the amount of her ''breast milk'' and the concentration of proteins and fat in her breast milk. Additionally, her breast milk will contain traces of the hormones from the pill. However, in contrast to the combination pill, the minipill is routinely used in lactating women.''Women who smoke and take the pill are at increased risk of ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''. There is no increased risk of ''heart attack'' or ''stroke'' among healthy nonsmoking women who use the pill.''Blood clots in the legs (''DVT'') and elsewhere are slightly more frequent with low-dose oral contraceptives, but the risk is very low, and lower than the increased risk of clotting that occurs with pregnancy. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives are ''not'' recommended for:''Smokers'' over 35 years of age should not use oral contraceptives, nor should women with a significant ''liver'' disorder.''A woman should contact her healthcare professional immediately if she experiences any of these side effects while taking the pill:' Some women experience temporary symptoms of spotting or light vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness, and nausea during the first one to three months of taking the pill. Nausea can be helped if the pill is taken after a meal. While women sometimes fear weight gain with oral contraceptives, studies of the low-dose preparations demonstrate that there is no significant weight gain with oral contraception and no major difference in weight change comparing various contraception products. Negative mood changes, such as depression, and pigmented patches of skin on the face (melasma) may occur with oral-contraceptive use. Because the progesterone in women can cause thinning of the lining of the uterus, some women may experience loss of menstrual periods (amenorrhea). Oral contraceptive-induced amenorrhea happens in about 1% of women in the first year of use. As long as the woman is properly taking her pills, amenorrhea is not harmful and it does not signal any loss of effectiveness of the pills. women with clotting tendencies (such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Leiden Factor 5), known coronary heart disease, stroke, unevaluated breast lumps, vaginal bleeding, or breast cancer. severe headache; leg cramps; change in vision, including blurred vision, vision loss, or flashing lights; abdominal pain; chest pain; shortness of breath; coughing up blood; or leg swelling or pain."
How is the pill taken?,"'No matter which type of birth-control pill a woman uses, she should take it every day at the same time in order to establish a routine. The woman needs to minimize the chance she will forget to take the pill, which is not an uncommon occurrence. This is especially critical in the case of the progestin-only pill (minipill). Forgetting to take the minipill, or taking it at varying times of the day, can significantly impair its effectiveness in contraception. This is due to the low dose of the minipill causing its effects to wear off rapidly if the pill is missed.' "
How long will it take before the pill prevents conception?," When a woman begins taking the pill, she may not be protected from pregnancy until she has been taking the pill for 10 consecutive days in a row. If a woman forgets to take a pill after she has started, she may be at risk for getting pregnant. If she only misses one pill, she should take it as soon as she remembers, even if it means taking two pills in the same day. If she misses two pills, she should take both of them as soon as she remembers, plus the pill for that day at her regular time. If she misses three pills, she should discontinue use of the pill for 4 more days to complete one week and then begin taking a new pack of birth control pills, whether she has a menstrual period or not. She must use an alternate form of birth control or abstain from sexual activity during the week that she stops taking her pills. If a woman continually forgets to take her pills, perhaps she should consider a different method of birth control."
What drugs or conditions reduce the effectiveness of the pill?,"'A woman should ask her healthcare professional about these matters and the necessity of using a backup method of birth control if any of these conditions exist.' The pill may partially lose its effectiveness if a woman vomits or has diarrhea for any reason. Some medications, including certain sedatives and some antibiotics such as penicillin and tetracycline, may reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Research in this area is ongoing."

When will I start having periods again after I quit taking the pill?," A woman's menstrual periods should begin again within about 3 months of stopping the oral-contraceptive pill. However, the length of delay before a woman's period returns after stopping the pill varies from woman to woman. Oral contraceptives are about 97% effective in preventing pregnancy. The pill does not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections."
Injection: depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA),"'Depot ''medroxyprogesterone'' acetate  (DMPA) is a synthetic long-acting form of the hormone progesterone. DMPA is similar to the birth-control minipill in that it does not contain estrogen.

Its effectiveness in preventing pregnancy is close to 100%.""""DMPA must be injected by a health care professional every three months (12 weeks). It is administered as a deep muscle (intramuscular) injection. A lower-dose formulation of the drug that is injected beneath the skin (subcutaneously) is also available. The injection must be administered within the first 5 days of a woman's menstrual period. She is then protected from pregnancy within 24 hours of receiving the injection.""'A woman may stop having periods altogether after using DMPA for one year. After two years of use, 70% of women will have no menstrual bleeding. Menstrual periods stop because the DMPA causes the ovaries to go into a ""resting"" state. When the ovaries do not release an egg every month, the regular growth of the lining of the uterus does not occur and no uterine lining is shed during the subsequent menstrual cycle.'""A woman's menstrual periods should begin again within six to 18 months after she stops taking the injections. A woman can also become pregnant, usually within 12 to 18 months, once she stops using DMPA. If a new mother does not breastfeed her baby, she can resume the injections right after ""'childbirth''. Mothers who are breastfeeding can safely begin the injections six weeks after ''childbirth''. The injections do not reduce the flow of her breast milk, and no harmful effects on the baby have been noted.''The most common side effects of DMPA injections are irregular menstrual cycles, cessation of menstrual periods, and weight gain. Other side effects may include nervousness, ''dizziness'', stomach discomfort, ''headaches'', ''fatigue'', or breast tenderness. It is important that a woman realize that once she has been injected with DMPA, any side effects she may experience cannot be neutralized or eliminated. She has to tolerate these side effects until the medication wears off, typically three months later.''DMPA has also been shown to have a negative effect on ''bone mineral density'', especially with longer-term use; however, studies have shown that her previous ''bone density'' is usually restored when the drug is discontinued.''Women may be able to use DMPA when avoidance of estrogen is prudent for medical reasons (see oral contraceptives). A qualified health care provider should be able to help make the proper distinction. DMPA should not be used by women who have a history of breast ''cancer'', blood clots, ''liver disease'', unexplained vaginal bleeding, or ''stroke''. A woman on DMPA should contact her health care professional if she experiences a heavy menstrual flow, severe ''abdominal pain'', ''headaches'', or ''depression''.'""DMPA injections are over 99% effective if the injections are received according to the correct schedule. A woman using injection contraceptives has the advantage of being capable of becoming pregnant at a later time, if desired, simply by discontinuing use. DMPA does not increase a woman's risk of ""'cancer'', including breast ''cancer'', and greatly reduces her risk of developing uterine cancer.''Injectable hormonal contraceptives do not protect against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Contraceptive patch: Ortho-Evra,"'An adhesive patch has been developed that provides hormonal contraception through the skin, which is known as a transdermal (through the skin) delivery system. The patch is about the size of a half-dollar and can be worn on the arm, abdomen, or buttocks. A woman wears the patch for a week and then replaces it with a new patch.''These patches are called Ortho-Evra (ethinyl ''estradiol''/norelgestromin patch-topical), and are similar to the pill in that they contain both estrogen and progesterone. Ortho-Evra should be just as effective in preventing pregnancy as the pill. Ortho-Evra is similar to the pill in that it suppresses ovulation and has the advantage of improved compliance and convenience due to weekly administration. A woman only needs to remember to replace the patch once a week instead of being required to remember taking a pill every day. However, some studies have shown that the contraceptive patch may be associated with a greater risk of negative side effects, such as blood-clotting problems, than oral contraceptive pills.''Women who have medical reasons why oral contraceptives are not recommended (such as already having an underlying tendency toward blood clotting) may find that their prescribing physician also recommends against Ortho-Evra because of the similarity in the hormone ingredients of both types of contraceptives.'""It is important to ensure that the patch makes good contact with the skin. The patch could be a problem for those women who perspire heavily, swim, and/or take frequent showers because moisture can interfere with the patch's contact with the skin. Some women may also experience skin irritation at the site of the patch. Furthermore, contraceptive failure may be a risk in heavier women (those who weigh over 198 pounds, or 90 kilograms).""'As with all other hormonal methods of birth control, the patch will not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Contraceptive implants,"'A contraceptive implant known as Implanon is available in the U.S. Implanon provides contraception by the slow release of the progestin etonogestrel over a period of three years. Implanon is a thin rod that is inserted in the upper arm under local anesthesia. Protection from pregnancy occurs within 24 hours of insertion of the rod, and the failure rate is comparable with surgical sterilization (tubal ligations). One advantage of the Implanon rod is that fertility rapidly returns after removal of the rod.''A two-rod implant containing the progestin ''levonorgestrel'' (Jadelle) was approved by the FDA for 5 years of use, although it has not been marketed in the United States. Similarly, the Sino-Implant II contraceptive implant is similar to Jadelle, but is designed to remain in place for 4 years.''Preliminary studies of the product showed that it was generally well tolerated and effective in preventing pregnancy. However, these studies showed that irregular bleeding is a possible side effect of the product.''As with all other hormonal methods of birth control, Implanon will not protect a woman against sexually transmitted infections.' "
Vaginal ring: NuvaRing,"'A ring-shaped device that contains the hormones estradiol and etonogestrel (a progestin) can be placed in the vagina. It remains in place for three weeks continuously, then it is removed for one week to allow for a menstrual period. It continuously releases low levels of the hormone into the bloodstream for the entire three weeks.'' There is currently one brand available in the U.S., ''NuvaRing'' (etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol-vaginal ring). It is about 99% effective in preventing pregnancy, having the same high effectiveness as the other hormonal methods of contraception. The incidence of hormone-related side effects is similar to those seen with other hormonal contraceptive methods such as the pill and the patch. ''Vaginal discharge'' can sometimes occur as a side effect of the ring preparation.''NuvaRing does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.' "
How effective are hormonal birth control methods?,"'Hormonal methods of birth control are some of the most effective forms of birth control available. When used properly, their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy can approach 99%-100%. With typical use of ''birth control pills'', effectiveness is estimated to be about 95%. With any form of hormonal contraception, precisely following instructions for proper use will increase its effectiveness.' "
What is Alzheimer’s disease?,"'Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, slowly progressive disorder of the brain that affects memory and higher skills eventually making a person unfit to carry out the routine activities. Most people develop this disease in their mid-60s (late-onset Alzheimer’s) while for some\xa0the symptoms first appear between their 30s and mid-60s.' "
Can Alzheimer’s be cured permanently?,'There is no cure for Alzheimer’s. The progression of the diseases can be stopped or slowed by various drug and non-drug options. Medical help must be sought as soon as the symptoms appear.' 
What are the most common cancers?,"'Cancer'' is a leading cause of death worldwide. The most common cancers include:' In men: Prostate, lung and colorectal cancers In women: Breast, lung and colorectal cancers In children: Leukemia, brain tumors and lymphoma"
How cancer is usually treated?,"'The most common treatments for cancer include:''Surgery:'' It is usually used to remove the cancerous cells from the body. The surgeon might also remove some or all of the body part that is affected by cancer. For ''breast cancer'', part (or all) of the breast might be removed. For ''prostate cancer'', the ''prostate gland'' might be taken out. Surgery is not used for all types of cancers. For example, blood cancers like ''leukemia'' are best treated with ''drugs''.''Chemotherapy'':'' These are drugs to kill fast-growing cells or slow their growth. These drugs can be given through IV (into a vein through a needle) or as an oral pill. ''Chemo'' drugs travel to all parts of the body through the blood and are especially useful for aggressive cancers.''Radiation'':'' This method is also used to kill or slow the growth of cancer cells. It can be used alone or with surgery or chemotherapy. Sometimes, it’s given by placing a “seed” inside the cancer which gives off radiation and blasts the cancerous cells.\xa0' "
What is percutaneous mitral valve repair surgery?,"'Percutaneous mitral valve repair is a surgery to repair a leaky mitral valve (''mitral regurgitation''). A thin, flexible tube (catheter) carrying a special device is passed through the skin (percutaneously) into the ''heart'' during this procedure.''The heart has four chambers, the upper two are called atria and the lower two chambers are called ventricles. Four valves guard the flow of blood through the heart. These valves ensure an adequate flow of blood in a single direction and prevent any backflow. The four heart valves are''The mitral valve opens when the left ''atrium'' contracts (atrial systole) and the left ventricle relaxes (ventricular diastole), simultaneously. The mitral valve closes when the left ''atrium'' relaxes (atrial diastole) and the left ventricle contracts (ventricular systole). Thus, the closing of the mitral valve prevents the backflow of blood from the left ventricle and ensures the forward flow from the left ventricle to the aorta.''In some health conditions, the mitral valve fails to close properly and results in the reverse flow of blood into the left ''atrium'' (mitral regurgitation) during the left ventricle contraction. This will hamper an adequate flow of blood from the heart to the body and may produce several complications depending on the severity.''In percutaneous repair of a leaky mitral valve, doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) through the skin (percutaneously) in an artery in the groin and guide it to the mitral valve. The catheter is used to insert a clip or another special device to repair the defects in a leaking mitral valve.' Mitral valve: Located between the left atrium and the left ventricle. Tricuspid valve: Located between the right atrium and the right ventricle. Pulmonary valve: Located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery (the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs). Aortic valve: Located between the left ventricle and the aorta (the blood vessel that carries oxygenated blood from the heart)."
Is mitral valve repair a major surgery?,"'Mitral valve repair constitutes a major procedure. It may be performed during an open-heart surgery, which involves definite risk with respect to incision size, anesthesia, and infection risks. In around 60-80% cases, the mitral valve repair can be done through a small (2 to 4 inch) skin incision on the right side of the chest. With the advancements in surgical care, the surgical robot further limits the incision size to 1 inch. Even in these cases, the ICU stay is mandated for the first 24 hours after the surgery, and because anesthesia risks are present, the repairs done via robotic or laparoscopic methods, which also fall under major surgery.' "
What are the advantages of a percutaneous mitral valve repair surgery?,'The advantages of the percutaneous mitral valve repair surgery are:' Better quality of life Increased early and late survival Improved lifestyle Adequate preservation of heart function Lower risk of stroke and endocarditis (infection of heart) No need for using anticoagulants (blood thinners)
What is a lumbar puncture (LP)?,"'A lumbar puncture (LP) is the insertion of a needle into the spinal canal to collect and examine the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (cerebral spinal fluid). It is termed a ""lumbar puncture"" because the needle is placed in the lumbar portion of the back and used to puncture through tissues to enter the spinal canal.''Other names for a lumbar puncture (an LP) include spinal tap, spinal puncture, thecal puncture, and rachiocentesis.' "
Why is a lumbar puncture done?,"'An LP is most commonly performed to obtain a sample of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Examination of the fluid can be crucial in diagnosing diseases such as meningitis, neurologic diseases, or effects of systemic disease on the brain and spinal fluid. An LP can also be done to treat diseases, and as a way of administering antibiotics, ''cancer'' ''drugs'', or anesthetic agents into the spinal canal. Spinal fluid is sometimes removed by LP for the purpose of decreasing spinal fluid pressure in patients with uncommon conditions (such as, normal-pressure ''hydrocephalus'' and ''benign intracranial hypertension'', for example).''Sometimes a lumbar puncture is performed in patients with ''migraines'' to assure that no other underlying pathology exists.'  "
How is the LP procedure performed?,"'Patients typically lie on their side for the procedure. Less often, the procedure is performed while the patient is sitting up and leaning slightly forward.''After local anesthesia is injected into the lumbar area of the back, a long needle is inserted in between the bones of the spine (vertebrae) into the spinal canal. (The needle is most commonly placed between the third and fourth ''lumbar vertebrae''.)''Spinal fluid pressure can then be measured and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removed for testing.' "
What is the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)?,"'The CSF circulates around the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). This ""water bath"" acts as a support of buoyancy for the brain and spinal cord. The support of the CSF helps to protect the brain from injury.''The normal CSF appears clear and contains various substances, such as protein and ''sugar'' (glucose), and few if any cells. The spinal fluid also has a normal pressure when first removed.' "
What is normal CSF?,"'Normal values for spinal fluid examination are as follows:''These normal values can be altered by injury or disease of the brain, spinal cord, or adjacent tissues. The values are routinely evaluated during examination of the spinal fluid obtained from the lumbar puncture. Additionally, spinal fluid is tested for infection in the microbiology laboratory.''A health care professional will usually review and interpret the test results with the patient. These results often will need to be evaluated in relation to other blood and radiologic test results.' Protein (15-60 mg/dl) Glucose (50-80 mg/dl) Cell count (0-5 mononuclear cells) Initial pressure (70-180 mm)"
What diseases are diagnosed by examination of the CSF?,"'Spinal fluid obtained from the lumbar puncture can be used to diagnose many important diseases such as bleeding around the brain; increased pressure from ''hydrocephalus''; inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, or adjacent tissues (''encephalitis'', meningitis); tumors of the brain or spinal cord, etc. Sometimes spinal fluid can indicate diseases of the immune system, such as ''multiple sclerosis''.' "
"What are possible risks, complications, or side effects of a lumbar puncture?","'When spinal fluid is removed during an LP, the risks include ''headache''\xa0from a persistent spinal fluid leak, brain herniation, bleeding, and infection. Each of these complications are uncommon with the exception of ''headache'', which can appear from hours to up to a day after a lumbar puncture. Up to 25% of patients will get ''headaches'' after the procedure. ''Headaches'' occur less frequently when the patient remains lying flat several hours after the procedure.'  "
What are the benefits of a lumbar puncture?,"'The benefits of the LP depend upon the exact situation for which it is performed, but a lumbar puncture can provide lifesaving information.' "
What is targeted temperature management (therapeutic hypothermia)?,"'Targeted temperature management or therapeutic hypothermia is a type of treatment in which healthcare providers use cooling devices to lower the body temperature for a short time. When a person gets a cardiac arrest, the ''heart'' suddenly stops beating, and blood flow to the organs including the brain is affected. This can cause lasting damage. Lowering the body temperature to approximately 32-36°C right after a cardiac arrest can reduce the damage to the brain and improves the chances of recovery. Because during hypothermia, various metabolic processes slow down, which leads to a reduced requirement of blood by the organs.''During the procedure, the patient’s body is cooled using an induced hypothermia protocol for 24 hours to a goal temperature of 32-36°C. The goal is to achieve the target temperature as quickly as possible. In most cases, it can be achieved within three to four hours of initiating cooling. Rewarming begins 24 hours after the time of initiation of cooling when the person is brought back to their normal body temperature (around 37°C). During a therapeutic hypothermia procedure, the patient is given medications such as ''sedatives'' and painkillers beside medicines to prevent shivering.''The following body responses are associated with therapeutic hypothermia:''In the heart, hypothermia may reduce the area of injury, reduce the metabolic demand, and preserve the energy stores of the heart cells. Thus, therapeutic hypothermia reduces and retards the damaging processes that would occur if the patient is kept at their normal body temperature. It, therefore, allows the doctor to buy time until definitive therapy is provided to the patient.' Reduction in brain metabolism (approximately 6-8% per 1°C fall in body temperature) and demand for oxygen and nutrients Reduction of brain excitatory substances (such as reduced glutamate release) Preservation of brain structure and function along with stabilizing the blood-brain barrier (the barrier that allows selective passage of substances from the blood to the brain and vice versa) Reduced formation of the damaging free radicals and toxins The reduced tendency for cell damage and death Restoration of normal body processes such as protein synthesis and gene expression Inhibition of harmful inflammatory products (e.g., cytokines, interleukins and arachidonic acid cascade end products)"
What are the side effects of targeted temperature management (therapeutic hypothermia)?,'The major side effects of therapeutic hypothermia are' Shivering Arrhythmia (abnormal or irregular heart rhythm) Infections Blood clots Bleeding Electrolyte and metabolic disturbances Cold diuresis and hypovolemia (loss of fluids from the body due to increases urination caused by hypothermia)
7 Common Third trimester tests introduction,'During the last trimester of ''pregnancy'' your doctor may recommend that you have certain diagnostic tests. These tests are all safe and have been developed to ensure the optimum well-being of both mother and baby.''Listed are some of the most common tests women who are ''pregnant'' will given.' 
Group B streptococcus screening,"'Group B ''streptococcus'' (GBS) is a type of bacteria that can exist in the female reproductive tract without causing symptoms. Up to 30% of healthy women can carry ''group B strep'', and it usually does not cause problems. However, sometimes it can lead to serious infection of the bloodstream, infection of the placenta, or ''urinary tract infection''. Group B ''strep'' can also have serious consequences for the baby, causing potentially life-threatening infections in the ''newborn'', including meningitis,  ''pneumonia'', and ''sepsis''. Testing is simple and involves taking a sample from the vagina and from the rectum with a cotton swab. The swab is cultured in the laboratory to determine if group B ''strep'' is present. If the test is positive, you will be given antibiotics during ''labor'' to reduce the chances of infection in the baby. The test is usually done between the 35th and 37th weeks of pregnancy and should be done in subsequent ''pregnancies'' even if you test negative in your first pregnancy.' "
Electronic fetal heart rate monitoring,'Electronic fetal ''heart'' rate monitoring is often done to confirm that the baby is healthy. This type of monitoring is also done during  ''labor and delivery''. It can be done any time after the 20th week of gestation during ''prenatal'' checkups.' 
The nonstress test (NST),"'The nonstress test (NST) involves a fetal monitor strapped to the mother\'s abdomen to measure the baby\'s heart rate as it moves. It is called ""nonstress"" because no ''stress'' is placed on the fetus for the test. This test is sometimes performed on a weekly basis in high-risk pregnancies. It is done after the 28th week of pregnancy, though most often after 32 weeks. Measurements are typically taken for 20 to 30 minutes. A NST may be ordered if you feel the baby is not moving normally, if you are past your due date, or if your doctor wants to ensure that the placenta is healthy and functioning well. There are no known risks of the NST for the mother or the baby.' "
A biophysical profile,'A biophysical profile combines the information from a NST with an''ultrasound'' examination of the baby for a more precise evaluation.' 
A contraction stress test (CST),"'A contraction ''stress'"" test (CST), like the NST, measures fetal heart rate. However in this test, the baby's heart rate is measured in response to uterine contractions that are elicited by administering ""'oxytocin'' (''Pitocin'"") or by stimulation of the nipples. The test is sometimes referred to as an oxytocin challenge test. Normally, the flow of blood to the placenta slows during contractions, but if the placenta is functioning well, the baby's heart rate remains stable. If there is poor function of the placenta, the baby's heart rate will temporarily slow after a contraction. Looking at the baby's heart rate in response to uterine contractions can help the doctor estimate how the baby will respond to the stresses experienced during ""'labor''. This test is not performed as commonly as the NST or biophysical profile.' "
Amniocentesis,"'Although ''amniocentesis'' (removal of a sample of ''amniotic fluid'' with a long, thin needle) is most often done during the ''second trimester'', there are certain conditions that may warrant an amniocentesis later in pregnancy. These conditions include a suspicion of chorioamnionitis or a risk of premature delivery, since amniocentesis fluid can be used to estimate maturity of the fetal ''lungs''.' "
Ultrasound examinations,'Ultrasound examinations may be performed in the third trimester if needed to help evaluate fetal growth and look for problems with the placenta.' 
Facts you should know about thoracic outlet syndrome," Thoracic outlet syndrome is a condition whereby symptoms are produced from compression of nerves or blood vessels, or both, because of an inadequate passageway through an area (thoracic outlet) between the base of the neck and the armpit. Thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms includeneck pain,shoulder pain,arm pain,numbness and tingling of the fingers, andimpaired circulation to the extremities (causing discoloration). neck pain, shoulder pain, arm pain, numbness and tingling of the fingers, and impaired circulation to the extremities (causing discoloration). Diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome is suggested by the symptoms and physical findings and is sometimes supported by nerve conduction and/or radiology tests. Treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome usually involves physical-therapy exercises and avoiding certain prolonged positions of the shoulder."
What is thoracic outlet syndrome?,"'Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a condition whereby symptoms are produced (such as numbness in fingers, ''pain'' in shoulder, arm, and neck) due to compression of nerves and/or blood vessels in the upper chest. The passageway for these nerves and blood vessels to exit the chest and supply the upper extremities is referred to as the thoracic outlet. Muscle, bone, and other tissues border the thoracic outlet. Any condition that results in enlargement or movement of these tissues of or near the thoracic outlet can cause the thoracic outlet syndrome. These conditions include muscle enlargement (such as from ''weight lifting''), injuries, an extra rib extending from the neck (cervical rib), ''weight gain'', and rare tumors at the top of the lung. Often no specific cause is detectable.''It is felt by some scientists that the evolution of the torso of primates from a four-legged to a two-legged position may predispose humans to the development of thoracic outlet syndrome. The resulting vertical posture produced flattening of the chest cage and a shift of the shoulder joint backward, both of which narrowed the thoracic outlet.' "
What causes thoracic outlet syndrome?,"'An inadequate passageway for nerves and blood vessels as they pass through an area (thoracic outlet) between the base of the neck and the armpit causes thoracic outlet syndrome. This can be constant or intermittent. Thoracic outlet syndrome can be caused by weight lifting, ''obesity'', tumors in the chest, and extra ribs extending from the seventh cervical vertebra at the base of the neck.'  "
What are thoracic outlet syndrome risk factors?,"'Risk factors include occupations that involve heavy usage of the upper extremities against resistance, including jack-hammer operators and dental hygienists, weight lifting, ''pregnancy'', and obesity. Any condition that causes encroachment of the space for the brachial plexus at the thoracic outlet can lead to thoracic outlet syndrome, including poor posture.' "
What are thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms include neck, shoulder, and arm ''pain'', numbness in the fingers, or impaired circulation and flushed sensations to the extremities (causing discoloration). The involved upper extremity can feel weak. Often symptoms are reproduced or worsened when the arm is positioned above the shoulder or extended. Patients can have a wide spectrum of symptoms from mild and intermittent to severe and constant. Pains can extend to the fingers and hands, causing ''weakness''.'  "
What tests do physicians use to diagnose thoracic outlet syndrome?,"'The diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome is suggested by the symptoms and supported by findings of the doctor during the examination. Certain maneuvers of the arm and neck can produce symptoms and blood vessel ""pinching,"" causing a loss of pulse. This includes the Adson\'s maneuver, whereby the examiner moves the shoulder joint into positions that can cause pinching of both the nerves and artery to the tested arm. Further supportive testing can include electrical tests, such as ''electromyogram'' (''EMG'') and somatosensory evoked responses (although these may not be positive in all patients). Some patients can have ''angiogram'' X-ray tests that demonstrate the pinched area of the blood vessel involved.'  "
What is the treatment for thoracic outlet syndrome? What are medications for thoracic outlet syndrome? Is surgery necessary for TOS?,"'Treatment of the thoracic outlet syndrome can usually be successful with conservative measures. Treatments include a variety of exercises that effectively stretch open the tissues of the thoracic outlet. These are done with and without weights in the hands to pull the outlet into a ""relaxed"" open position. Physical therapists are specially trained in the instruction of exercises for thoracic outlet syndrome, and their evaluation of the patient can be helpful. Shoulder-shrug exercises and others can be done at home or at work to relax the muscles around the thoracic outlet.''A health care professional might prescribe medications to help improve the symptoms, such as anti-inflammatory medications (''ibuprofen'' [''Advil''], ''naproxen'' [''Aleve'']) and muscle relaxants.''Some patients with severe, resistant symptoms can require surgery to open the thoracic outlet. These procedures include interruption of the scalene muscle (scalenotomy) and removal (resection) of the first rib in order to spare injury to the affected nerve and blood vessels from ongoing compression. Thoracic outlet syndrome that affects the vascular system (veins and arteries) is more likely to require surgery to resolve the symptoms.'  "
What are home remedies for thoracic outlet syndrome?,"'Patients should avoid prolonged positions with their arms held out or overhead. For example, it is best to avoid sleeping with the arm extended up behind the head. It is also helpful to have rest periods at work to minimize ''fatigue''. Weight reduction can be helpful for ''obese'' patients. Patients should avoid sleeping on their stomach with their arms above the head. They should also not repetitively lift heavy objects.' "
What types of doctors treat thoracic outlet syndrome?,"'Doctors who treat thoracic outlet syndrome include general physicians, such as general-medicine doctors, family medicine doctors, and internists, as well as ''rheumatologists'', physical-medicine doctors, and chest surgeons.' "
What is the prognosis for thoracic outlet syndrome?,"'Most people with thoracic outlet syndrome can have complete resolution of symptoms with conservative measures, including exercises specific for thoracic outlet syndrome, physical therapy, and avoiding stressing the tissues of the thoracic outlet. It can be helpful to avoid sleeping with the arms extended above the head. Rarely, surgical intervention can be necessary to take pressure off of involved nerves and blood vessels. Complications include embolization to the hand and nerve damage to the extremity involved.' "
Is it possible to prevent thoracic outlet syndrome?,"""It's possible to prevent thoracic outlet syndrome by maintaining relaxed tissues of the upper chest. This can involve ""'prevention'' exercises, stretches, and therapies designed to loosen the tissues around the shoulders and neck.' "
What is an esophageal myotomy surgery?,"'Esophageal myotomy is a surgical procedure to loosen the tight valve between the food pipe (''esophagus'') and the stomach. The thick muscle of the lower part of the esophagus and the upper part of the stomach is cut to relieve the difficulty in swallowing (''dysphagia''). This condition occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter fails to relax properly (achalasia). It is an uncommon disorder of the\xa0esophagus characterized by inadequate relaxation of the lower esophageal muscle, and the loss of motility. Achalasia causes difficulty in pushing the swallowed food into the stomach. This is commonly seen in young people, age ranging from ''teens'' to 30s, and they present with:''An esophageal myotomy surgery provides relief from achalasia by disrupting the muscles of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax the esophagus and allow passage for food.' Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) for both solids and liquids at the same time Regurgitation (the swallowed food is pushed back into the oral cavity) Heartburn Dry cough Chest pain Weight loss"
When will I be able to eat after a myotomy surgery?,'You will be able to have liquids on the evening of your operation. You will be then advanced to a soft ''diet'' and discharged from the hospital the following day. Your doctor may give you medications to prevent ''nausea'' besides painkillers and antibiotics. You will be advised to avoid strenuous activity and heavy lifting for four to six weeks. You may be able to resume normal activities within one to two weeks and a regular ''diet'' in two to six weeks after the surgery.' 
What are the complications of a thoracoscopic and laparoscopic myotomy surgery?,"'Complications are similar in both thoracoscopic and laparoscopic myotomies, however, certain complications, such as reflux, may be more frequent in case of a thoracoscopic myotomy.''The complications of a myotomy surgery include:' Esophageal perforation or hole Bleeding Infections Pneumothorax (presence of air between the lungs and the chest wall) Nerve injury Spleen injury Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) Scarring in the lower part of the esophagus or the upper part of the stomach Stricture formation (areas of abnormal narrowing of the esophagus or the stomach)"
What is cardiac tamponade?,"'Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition caused by excessive fluid accumulation in the protective sac (pericardium) around the ''heart''. The fluid exerts pressure on the heart and impairs its ability to pump blood.''Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency, and without prompt diagnosis and treatment, can lead to dangerously ''low blood pressure'', fluid in ''lungs'', multi-organ failure, ''shock'' and death.' "
What are three signs of cardiac tamponade?,"'The three classic signs (Beck’s triad) that indicate cardiac tamponade are:''Apart from the above-mentioned signs, the doctor may use tests such as ''echocardiogram'', a ''CT scan'', magnetic resonance ''angiogram'' (MRA) and ''electrocardiogram'' to confirm the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade, its extent, and severity.' Low pressure in the arteries (hypotension) Bulging (distended) neck veins Muffled heart sounds"
What are the signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade?,"'The symptoms of cardiac tamponade vary with the underlying cause of the fluid accumulation and severity of the condition. Besides Beck’s triad, other symptoms and signs may include:' Chest pain radiating to neck, shoulders and back Chest pressure Breathing difficulties Shortness of breath Rapid breathing Weakness Confusion Restlessness and anxiety Clammy and cold extremities Decreased urine output Elevated heart rate (tachycardia) Increased pressure in the jugular vein Abnormally large drop in systolic pressure and pulse while inhaling (pulsus paradoxus)"
What causes cardiac tamponade?,"'The ''pericardial sac'' is a thin, two-layered sheath surrounding the heart, normally containing a small amount of fluid. When large amounts of blood or other fluids accumulate in the ''pericardial'' space between the layers of pericardium, it is known as ''pericardial effusion''. This exerts pressure on the heart and compresses it, resulting in cardiac tamponade.''Cardiac tamponade is usually the result of injury to the pericardium due to ''trauma'' or other underlying diseases. ''Malignant'' diseases are the most common reason for cardiac tamponade. Other causes of cardiac tamponade include:' Rupture of aortic aneurysm Chest injury from stabbing or gunshot Trauma to the chest from an accident Cardiac and other surgeries in the chest region Accidental perforation due to procedures like placement of pacemaker or catheter, and angiography Heart attack and heart failure Inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis) caused by viral or bacterial infections Radiation treatment to the chest and radiofrequency ablation Final stages of lung and other cancers High level of urea in the blood (uremia) due to kidney disease/failure Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection Certain drugs which cause fluid to develop Connective tissue diseases such as Lupus Rheumatoid arthritis Dermatomyositis Hypothyroidism Still disease Genetic muscle degeneration disease (Duchenne muscular dystrophy) Anticoagulant treatment like blood thinners"
What is the difference between pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade?,"'Pericardial effusion is accumulation of fluid that increases the pressure in the pericardial ''cavity''. When the pressure increases sufficiently to adversely affect the heart’s function, cardiac tamponade results.' "
What is the treatment for cardiac tamponade?,"'Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment in an intensive care unit. The underlying cause must be treated along with urgent drainage of the fluid. A cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon treats the patient and the first line of treatment is typically:''Positive pressure ventilation is avoided as it can further aggravate symptoms. Once the patient is stabilized, the doctor performs further tests to determine the underlying condition and treat it.''Patients who do not stabilize with the above procedures, or those with recurrent tamponade might need surgery and further treatment.' Oxygen to reduce the heart’s workload Drugs to improve heart function and reduce blood pressure IV fluids, blood or plasma to increase the volume of blood in circulation (volume expansion) Bed rest with leg elevation Drainage of pericardial fluid (pericardiocentesis)"
What is the prognosis for cardiac tamponade?,"'The key to reducing deaths from cardiac tamponade is prompt diagnosis and treatment. The survival rate drops with each delay in treatment, and without treatment it is fatal. In patients with cardiac tamponade caused by malignant disease, the mortality rate is over 75% within one year.' "
What is throat (larynx) cancer?,"'Throat cancer (''laryngeal cancer'') is a general term that usually refers to cancer of the pharynx and/or larynx (voice box). Regions included when considering throat cancer include the pharynx (nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx [cancers that occur in the tissues of the throat adjacent to the larynx], glottis, supraglottis, and subglottis); about half of throat cancers develop in the larynx (the part of the throat with the vocal cords), and the other half in the pharynx (pharyngeal cancer). Consequently, any cancers (growth and/or spread of abnormal cells that form tumors or ''metastasize'' to other parts of the body) that develop in these regions of the throat are considered throat cancers. For this article, the terms throat cancer and larynx cancer will be interchangeable. The term laryngeal cancer also is used to refer to larynx cancer. ''Nasopharyngeal cancer'' and oropharyngeal cancer (mouth and pharynx) or will not be discussed in this article.''Some investigators consider throat cancers a subset of esophageal cancers. For this article, only throat cancers will be discussed. Esophageal cancers have the potential to cause throat symptoms such as burning or ''pain'' (pressure) in the throat as well as the chest since they can extend throughout the ''esophagus'' from just below the pharynx to the junction of the esophagus and stomach. Moreover, esophageal cancers may include all of the throat cancer signs, symptoms, and most diagnostic and treatment protocols discussed in this article -- particularly when they are located high in the esophagus.''The American Cancer Society statistics suggest that about 12,410 new cases of laryngeal cancer will occur in 2019 (9,860 in men and 2,550 in women), with about 3,760 deaths. Five-year survival rates vary somewhat with the location of the cancer and its stage (see below). Most types have a 5-year survival rate in stage I and/or II that range from about 53%-64% except for those that occur in the glottis (the part of the larynx including the vocal cords), which is about 74%-90%. Stages III-IV 5-year survival varies from about 6%-24%, with stage IV having the lowest 5-year survival rate.' "
What causes throat cancer?,"'Although it is not clear exactly what causes throat cancers, the cancerous cells develop when genetic mutations allow the cells to grow uncontrollably to form tumors (masses of cancer cells) that may metastasize (spread) to other areas in the body. Some of the factors that can lead to genetic mutations in the cells of the throat include ''cigarette smoking'', infections with the ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV'' [or ''HPV''-related infections]), and exposure to toxic substances like ''asbestos'' or large quantities of ''alcohol''.' "
What are the risk factors for throat cancer?,"'Some of the risk factors for throat cancer are related to lifestyle. For example, individuals can increase the risk of such cancers by ''smoking'' or using other tobacco products, chewing betel nuts (a common practice by South Asians), drinking excess alcohol, and consuming insufficient ''vitamin A''. Exposure to asbestos, poor ''dental hygiene'', and especially exposure to HPV human papillomavirus are also risk factors in some case-control studies. HPV exposure is significant because about 50% to 90% of squamous cell carcinomas (squamous cell cancer), the most common type of throat cancers, have been linked to HPV infections that can be acquired with oral sex. Some researchers think infection with the ''Epstein-Barr virus'' is a risk factor. In addition, being male and/or having an African-American heritage also increases risk.' "
What are the types of larynx (throat) cancer?,"'The types of larynx (throat) cancers are as follows:' Squamous cell carcinoma (most common type of throat cancer) Adenocarcinoma (cancer of glandular cells that release mucus, occurs infrequently) Other types that may occur rarely are as follows:LymphoepitheliomaMucoepidermoid carcinomaSpindle cell carcinomaVerrucous cancerLymphomaUndifferentiated carcinomaSarcomaMelanoma Lymphoepithelioma Mucoepidermoid carcinoma Spindle cell carcinoma Verrucous cancer Lymphoma Undifferentiated carcinoma Sarcoma Melanoma"
What are the symptoms and signs of throat cancer?,"'The symptoms and signs of throat cancer often vary from person to person. The most common signs and ''symptoms of throat cancer'' are nonspecific. Not every patient will exhibit each sign and symptom of these ''throat cancer symptoms'', but each patient will usually have at least one or two of the following:''As stated above, these symptoms and signs are not diagnostic for throat cancer because many other problems can mimic the throat cancer. However, any person who develops these signs and symptoms and has risk factors for throat cancer should immediately discuss them with his or her physician.'   Voice change or hoarseness of the voice Cough (usually chronic) Sore throat (usually chronic) Throat discomfort (feeling like something is caught in the throat) Difficulty swallowing or swallowing problems with certain foods A mass or lump in the neck Weight loss (unintentional) Some difficulty with breathing Ear pain Constant phlegm production"
How do health care professionals diagnose throat cancer?,"""The person's individual history (especially the presence of potential risk factors) and physical examination may provide a physician with enough suspicious information that the physician will consider throat cancer as a possible diagnosis. Consequently, the physician may strongly suggest doing additional tests to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of throat cancer. Although imaging tests such as CT, ""'MRI'', PET scan, and others like chest ''X-rays'', laryngoscopy, and barium swallows provide very useful information about extent and location of the cancer, the definitive diagnosis of throat cancer is made by biopsy of the tumor. Biopsy may be done by surgical incision in the neck, fine needle aspiration of the tumor, or by an endoscopic biopsy.' "
How do health care professionals determine throat cancer staging?,"'Throat cancer staging is determined by a TNM staging system. The system was developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and is presented below.''All of this information is combined to arrive at a disease stage. After stage 0 (which is ''carcinoma in situ'' or cancer that has not grown beyond the cells lining the throat), stages are labeled using Roman numerals from I through IV (that is, 1 through 4). The smaller the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, for example stage IV, indicates a more serious stage of the disease.' T stands for tumor (how far it has spread within the larynx or pharynx and to nearby tissues). N describes whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. M stands for metastasis (spread of the cancer) to distant organs."
What kinds of specialists treat throat cancer?,"""Most institutions take a team approach to each individual with throat cancer. In general, depending upon the extent of the individual's cancer (see, TMN system above), a person's team of specialists (usually board-certified) may include the following:""'The involvement of many specialists has been found to provide an individual with the best chance of treating and/or surviving the various types of throat cancers, follow-up treatments, and reducing symptoms. These specialists also can identify local support groups that can help the patient and family members cope with the lifestyle changes needed to live well with the disease.' Oncologists Surgeons Plastic surgeons Radiation oncologists Swallowing experts Dentists Speech pathologists Dietitians Therapists (physical, occupational, and speech)"
What is the treatment for throat cancer?,"""The treatment for throat cancer depends upon the extent and seriousness of the disease. As stated by the MD Anderson Cancer Center and others, treatment is tailored to the individual to provide him or her with the best chance for a successful outcome. Treatment strives to preserve the patient's ability to eat, speak, and live a normal healthy life. Treatment plans for throat cancers usually include one or more of the following techniques: surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, proton therapy, targeted therapies, and possibly participation in throat cancer ""'clinical trials''. Brief descriptions of the major components for throat cancer therapy are as follows:''Side effects of treatment vary from person to person. However, some of the most common side effects include inflammation of mucous membranes, ''dry mouth'', skin changes (especially after radiotherapy), ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' (especially with chemotherapy), ''fatigue'', ''sore throat'', ''difficulty swallowing'', increased sticky phlegm production, ''loss of appetite'', loss of taste, ''hair loss'', and breathing difficulties. In many patients who develop side effects, most effects will last from a few weeks to a few months although in a few patients they may remain indefinitely.'   Surgery: There are many types of surgery for throat cancer, including minimally invasive, transoral laser microsurgery, endoscopic, laser, robotic, and tumor excision surgery, like supracricoid partial laryngectomy to allow more normal function in swallowing and speech without a stoma (a surgically made opening in the neck that allows breathing). Chemotherapy: These are anti-cancer drugs used to shrink tumors and/or kill cancer cells after surgery and/or radiation treatment. Chemotherapy (for example, cetuximab [Erbitux]) often is used in combination with other therapies. Radiation therapy: Brachytherapy involves placement of radioactive beads close to a tumor. 3-D radiation beam therapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy may be tailored to the specific shape of the tumor. Often, radiation may be used as a first-line treatment; high-energy radiation beams may destroy or shrink the tumor. Proton therapy: This radiation doses using pencil beam technology directed at the tumor while preserving nearby healthy tissue. Targeted therapies: These drugs are used to stop the growth of cancer cells by interfering with proteins and/or other receptors on cancer cells. Cancer clinical trials: This involves the use of experimental drugs or other methods that may show promise in survival and/or reduction in clinical symptoms."
Are there home remedies for throat (larynx) cancer?,"'There are no home remedies that can cure throat cancers. However, there are home remedies that might reduce some of the symptoms in some patients. They are not medically recommended as initial or first treatments but like most home remedies may reduce some symptoms in certain patients. They are as follows:''Patients should discuss with their doctors the use of these home remedies before trying them.' Herbs (for example, green tea and garlic) Dietary supplements including vitamins and foods containing vitamin C and folate Hydrotherapy (hot and/or cold wraps) Acupuncture Physical therapy Lifestyle changes, including exercise, appropriate diet, and avoidance of smoking"
What kind of support is available for those with throat cancer?,"'Most treatment methods involve continued support for those with throat cancer. Patients receive rehabilitation support such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Other patients may require additional surgical treatment such as reconstructive surgery and/or ''dental implants''. In addition, speech pathologists, audiologists, and experts in swallowing rehabilitation may be needed. Support groups may provide additional helpful advice about coping with the disease.' "
What is the prognosis for patients with throat cancer?,"'The prognosis or outcome for patients with throat cancer varies with the stage and location of the cancer. Most prognostic indicators are based on a 5-year relative survival rate that varies with the type of cancer and its stage. The best survival is in cancer of the glottis (90%) and worst is in cancer of the hypopharynx (53%), both beginning at stage I over a 5-year period. Unfortunately, in all individuals with throat cancer, the 5-year survival rate declines as the stages progress from 1 to IV. Consequently, the earlier the cancer is diagnosed (early-stage) and treated the better the potential outcome.' "
Is it possible to prevent throat cancer?,"'Although general throat ''cancer screening'' is not available, those individuals that are at higher risk for throat cancer may need to see their physicians if any signs and symptoms raise suspicion of throat cancer. Consequently, those who are at increased risk such as individuals who smoke or who may have been exposed to HPV, asbestos, nickel, or sulfuric acid fumes are at higher risk. Avoiding such risky situations can reduce the risk of throat cancer but there is no guarantee that it can be prevented. However, one excellent way to reduce the cancer risk is to have young men and women be vaccinated with the ''HPV vaccine''.' "
What is thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)?,"'Thrombocytopenia is lower than a normal number of platelets (less than 150,000 platelets per microliter) in the blood. Normal platelet counts range from 150,000 to 400,000 per microliter in the blood.''Platelets are one of the cellular components of the blood along with white and ''red blood cells''. Platelets play an important role in clotting and bleeding. Platelets are made in the bone marrow similar to other cells in the blood. Platelets originate from megakaryocytes, which are large cells found in the bone marrow. The fragments of these megakaryocytes are platelets that are released into the bloodstream. The circulating platelets make up about two-thirds of the platelets that are released from the bone marrow. The other third is typically stored (sequestered) in the spleen.''Platelets, in general, have a brief lifespan in the blood (7 to 10 days), after which they are removed from circulation. The number of platelets in the blood is referred to as the platelet count and is normally between 150,000 to 400,000 per microliter (one-millionth of a liter) of blood. Platelet counts less than 150,000 are termed thrombocytopenia. A platelet count greater than 400,000 is called thrombocytosis.''Platelets participate in coagulation. Platelets initiate a sequence of reactions that eventually lead to the formation of a ''blood clot''. They circulate in the blood vessels and become activated if there is any bleeding or injury in the body. Certain chemicals are released from the injured blood vessels or other structures that signal platelets to become activated and join the other components of the system to initiate coagulation. When activated, the platelets become sticky and adhere to one another and to the blood vessel wall at the site of the injury to slow down and stop the bleeding by plugging up the damaged blood vessel or tissue (hemostasis).''It is important to note that even though the platelet numbers are decreased in thrombocytopenia, their function often remains completely intact. Other disorders exist that can cause impaired platelet function despite normal platelet count.''A platelet count below 10,000 is severe thrombocytopenia and may result in spontaneous bleeding. In mild thrombocytopenia, there may be no adverse effects in the clotting or bleeding pathways. These effects vary with different low platelet counts from person to person.' "
What are the symptoms of thrombocytopenia?,"'In many instances, thrombocytopenia may have no symptoms, especially if mild, and it can be detected only incidentally on routine blood work done for other reasons. However, the symptoms and signs of thrombocytopenia may include:'   Superficial bleeding into 
the skin resulting in small reddish spots (petechiae) Fatigue Easy or excessive bruising (purpura) Prolonged bleeding cuts Spontaneous bleeding from the gums or 
nose Jaundice Heavy menstrual bleeding that's unusual 
for the individual Blood in the urine or stools Enlarged spleen Bleeding that will not stop DVT (deep vein thrombosis)"
What causes thrombocytopenia?,"'Low platelet counts or thrombocytopenia, can be caused by a variety of reasons. In general, they can be divided into:''Some of the most common and important causes of thrombocytopenia are outlined below. '   decreased platelet production,  increased platelet destruction or consumption, or  increased splenic sequestration (capturing of circulating platelets in the spleen). "
Decreased platelet production,"'Decreased platelet production is usually related to a bone marrow problem. In some of these conditions, red blood cell and white blood cell productions may also be affected.' Viral infections affecting the marrow for exampleparvovirus,rubella,mumps,chickenpox (varicella),hepatitis C,Epstein-Barr virus, andHIV. parvovirus, rubella, mumps, chickenpox (varicella), hepatitis C, Epstein-Barr virus, and HIV. Aplastic anemia is a general term used when the bone marrow fails to produce any blood cells (red cells, white cells, and platelets), also called pancytopenia. This can be caused by some viral infections (parvovirus or HIV), medications (gold, chloramphenicol, phenytoin [Dilantin], valproate [Depakote]), or radiation, or rarely, it can be congenital (Fanconi's anemia). Chemotherapy drugs frequently cause bone marrow suppression resulting in thrombocytopenia. Some drugs other than chemotherapy can suppress platelet production, such as thiazide diuretics. Cancers of the bone marrow and blood (leukemia) or cancers of the lymph nodes (lymphoma) can cause various degrees of thrombocytopenia. Cancers from other organs can sometimes infiltrate (invade) the bone marrow and result in impaired production of platelets. Long term alcohol can cause direct toxicity of the bone marrow. Deficiency of vitamin B12 and folic acid can result in low platelet production by the bone marrow."
Increased platelet destruction or consumption,"'Increased platelet destruction or consumption can be seen in a number of medical conditions. They can be divided into immune related and non-immune related causes.''Many medications can cause low platelet count by causing immunologic reaction against platelets, called drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Some examples may include:' sulfonamide antibiotics,carbamazepine [(Tegretol, Tegretol XR , Equetro, Carbatrol) anti-seizure drug],digoxin (Lanoxin),quinine (Quinerva, Quinite, QM-260),quinidine (Quinaglute, Quinidex),acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), andrifampin. carbamazepine [(Tegretol, Tegretol XR , Equetro, Carbatrol) anti-seizure drug], digoxin (Lanoxin), quinine (Quinerva, Quinite, QM-260), quinidine (Quinaglute, Quinidex), acetaminophen (Tylenol and others), and rifampin. Heparin, a commonly used blood thinner, and similar medications [low molecular weight heparins like enoxaparin (Lovenox) can occasionally induce an immune response against platelets resulting in rapid and severe destruction of platelets. This condition is termed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or HIT. HIT develops about 1 to 2 days in HIT type 1 and is a non-immune disorder that occurs because of the direct effect of heparin platelet activation. However, HIT type 2 is an immune mediated disorder that occurs about 4 to10 days after exposure to heparin and can develop into life- and limb-threatening complications. HIT is usually not marked by bleeding problems, but by DVT and pulmonary embolism. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings and supported by laboratory findings such as 30% drop platelet count acute thrombotic event like DVT, presence of heparin-PF4 antibodies and the resolution of thrombocytopenia after stopping heparin. Guidelines for treating HIT are too detailed to cover in this article, but can be found in reference 2. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a condition where the immune system attacks platelets. In severe conditions, ITP can result in very low platelet counts. In adults, this is often a chronic (long standing) condition, whereas, in children, it can be caused acutely after a viral infection. This is usually a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning other causes need to be ruled out. Some rheumatologic conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune conditions (connective tissue diseases), can cause platelet destruction. Transfusion of blood products and organ transplantation can sometimes cause immunologic disturbances resulting in thrombocytopenia. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are related conditions that can cause non-immune consumptive thrombocytopenia resulting from some infection bacteria in the blood), pregnancy, some metastatic cancers, or chemotherapy. Other manifestations of these conditions include kidney insufficiency, confusion, anemia (hemolytic), and fever. Classic HUS is largely seen in children and is generally thought of as an aftermath of an infection with a certain strain of  Escherichia coli bacteria (E. coli O157:H7) which causes infectious diarrhea. HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver tests, low platelets) is another non-immune thrombocytopenia that may occur during pregnancy and can include elevation of liver enzymes and anemia (specifically, hemolytic anemia or rupturing of red blood cells). Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is a rare but severe condition that may be a complication of overwhelming infections, traumas, burns, or pregnancy. Injury to or inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis) and, sometimes, artificial heart valves can cause increased destruction of platelets. Severe infections (sepsis) or trauma can sometimes cause consumptive thrombocytopenia (without DIC)."
Splenic sequestration,"'Splenic sequestration can also lead to low platelet counts as a result of enlargement or change in function of the spleen for a variety of reasons. When the spleen enlarges, it can retain (sequester) more than the usual amount of platelets. Common causes of thrombocytopenia due to splenic enlargement may include advanced ''liver disease'' with ''portal hypertension'' (''cirrhosis'', for example, from chronic ''hepatitis B'' or C) and blood cancers (leukemias or ''lymphomas'').' Dilutional thrombocytopenia can result from severe bleeding and transfusion of several units transfused red blood cells in a short time. Pseudothrombocytopenia (false thrombocytopenia) is a commonly encountered condition where the number of platelets seen on a complete blood count analysis (CBC) may falsely appear low because of the clumping of platelets together. This can lead to an artificially reduced automated count. If this is suspected, the blood can be redrawn in a tube with a material that prevents clumping of platelets for repeat analysis. A peripheral smear review will identify platelet clumping. Thrombocytopenia can also be present at birth, called neonatal thrombocytopenia. Most of these cases can be caused by processes similar to those above, although, they are occasionally related to rare genetic conditions."
When should I seek medical care for thrombocytopenia?,"'If thrombocytopenia is detected on a routine blood work, it is generally addressed and investigated by the physician who orders the test. In people with known thrombocytopenia, follow-up care is decided based on the diagnosis and the severity. However, if a person has one or more of the above listed symptoms, they should seek a health-care professional as thrombocytopenia may quickly worsen and become serious in some individuals.''People with thrombocytopenia are, in general, initially cared for by an internist or a family practice physician. Sometimes, consultation with a doctor who specializes in ''blood disorders'' (hematologist) is helpful for more thorough investigation or treatment, but others may require additional help.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat thrombycytopenia (low platelet count)?,"'Although some primary care doctors and pediatricians can treat thrombocytopenia, other specialists such as emergency medicine, hematologists, internal medicine, critical care and immunologists may be needed to treat and diagnose the problem or its underlying cause.' "
How is thrombocytopenia diagnosed?,"'Thrombocytopenia is usually detected incidentally from routine blood work done for other reasons. Platelets are a component of the complete blood count (CBC) which also contains information on red blood cells and white blood cells.''If thrombocytopenia is seen for the first time, it is prudent to repeat the complete blood count in order to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia (see above). If the repeat CBC confirms low platelet counts, then further evaluation can begin.''Once detected, the cause of thrombocytopenia may be investigated by the doctor. The most essential part of this evaluation includes a thorough physical examination and medical history of the patient. In the medical history, the complete list of all medications is routinely reviewed. Some of the other important components of the history include reviewing previous known history of low platelet count, family history of thrombocytopenia, recent infections, any previous cancers, other autoimmune disorders, or ''liver disease''.''A review of the symptoms related to excessive bleeding or bruising can also provide additional information. As a part of a thorough physical examination, special attention may be given to the skin and ''mucus'' membrane in the oral ''cavity'' for petechiae or purpura or other signs of bleeding. On the abdominal examination, an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) can provide important diagnostic clues.''The urgency to perform additional testing and evaluation is largely dependent on how low the platelet count is on the blood count, and what the clinical situation may be. For instance, in a person who needs a surgery and has a platelet count of less than 50,000, the investigation will take precedence over one whose thrombocytopenia was detected on a yearly blood work with a platelet of 100,000.''A comprehensive review of the other components of the CBC is one of the most important steps in the evaluation of low platelet count. The CBC can tell us whether other blood disorders may be present, such as, anemia (low ''red cell count'' or ''hemoglobin''), erythrocytosis (''high red blood cell count'' or hemoglobin), leukopenia (low white cells count), or leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count). These abnormalities may suggest bone marrow problems as the potential cause of thrombocytopenia. Abnormally shaped or ruptured red cells (schistocytes) seen on the blood smear may suggest evidence of HELLP, TTP, or HUS (see above).''Another clue in the CBC is the mean platelet volume or MPV, which is an estimate of the average size of platelets in the blood. A low MPV number may suggest a platelet production problem, whereas, a high number may indicate increased destruction.''It is important to also review other blood work including the complete metabolic panel, coagulation panel, and ''urinalysis''. Certain abnormalities in these tests can suggest advanced ''liver'' disease (''cirrhosis''), kidney problems (''renal failure''), or other pertinent underlying medical conditions.''In some causes of thrombocytopenia, such as HIT or ITP, additional testing with antibodies may be useful. ''Bone marrow biopsy'' may sometimes be performed if a bone marrow problem is suspected.'  "
What is the treatment for thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)?,"'The treatment of thrombocytopenia is largely dependent upon the cause and the severity of the condition.''Some situations may require specific or emergent treatments, whereas, others need only be managed by occasional blood draws and monitoring of the platelet levels.''In auto-immune thrombocytopenia or ITP, steroids can be used to suppress the immune system in order to impair the destruction of platelets. In more severe cases, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or monoclonal antibodies may also be given to alter the immune process. In refractory cases, splenectomy (removal of the spleen) may be necessary.''If a drug is thought to be the cause of a low platelet count, then it may be discontinued by the supervising physician. In patients with HIT, it is very important to remove and limit the future use of any heparin products, including low molecular weight heparin (like Lovenox), immediately to prevent further immune response against the platelets.''If TTP or HUS is diagnosed, the treatment may include plasma exchange, plasmapheresis, or eculizumab. In cases with severe ''kidney failure'', ''dialysis'' may be necessary.''In general, platelet transfusion is not necessary, unless an individual with low platelets (less than 50,000) has an active bleeding or hemorrhage, or needs a surgery or other invasive procedures. Frequently, a platelet transfusion may be recommended without any bleeding if the count is less than 10,000.''In suspected cases of HIT or TTP, transfusion of platelets may not be recommended because the new platelets could potentially make the condition worse and more prolonged.'  "
What are the complications of thrombocytopenia?,"'The complications of thrombocytopenia may be excessive bleeding after a cut or an injury resulting in hemorrhage and major blood loss. However, spontaneous bleeding (without any injury or laceration) due to thrombocytopenia is uncommon, unless the platelet count is less than 10,000.''Other complications may be related to any other underlying factors or conditions. For example, autoimmune thrombocytopenia related to ''lupus'' may be associated with other complications of ''lupus''. TTP or HUS can have many complications including severe anemia, confusion or other neurologic changes, or ''kidney failure''. HIT or heparin induced thrombocytopenia can have devastating complications related to ''blood clot'' formation (thrombosis). The mortality rate for HIT is about 20% to 30%, according to a 2016 study.' "
Can thrombocytopenia be prevented?,"'In general, thrombocytopenia can be prevented if the cause is known and it is preventable. For example, if a certain medication is found to induce a low platelet count in an individual, then its future use needs to be avoided. Alcohol avoidance should be encouraged in people with known alcohol-induced thrombocytopenia. Current and future use of all heparin products must be avoided in people diagnosed with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.' "
What is the prognosis for a person with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)?,"'The prognosis for someone with thrombocytopenia depends on the cause and the severity of the disease. Generally, when thrombocytopenia is diagnosed early, the outcomes are very good. However, delayed diagnosis can result in problems ranging from ''heart attack'', organ damage (for examples, spleen, bowel, kidney) to ''pulmonary embolism'', each of which has a more guarded prognosis. HIT, as previously mentioned, is serious and still has a mortality rate.' "
What is thrush?,"'Thrush (oropharyngeal candidiasis) is a medical condition in which a yeast-shaped fungus called ''Candida albicans'' (the older and less often used name for ''Candida'' is ''Monilia'') overgrows in the mouth and throat. ''C. albicans '""is normally present in the mouth, digestive tract, and skin of most healthy people. The immune system and the body's normal bacteria usually keep ""'Candida'' in balance. When this balance is interrupted, it can result in an overgrowth of the ''Candida'' fungus, causing thrush, a ''yeast infection'' of the mouth or throat (esophageal candidiasis).''Thrush infection (oral ''yeast infection'') is not the same as a vaginal yeast infection (also called ''moniliasis''). However, the ''Candida'' fungus also causes ''diaper rash'', but ''diaper rash'"" occurs on a child's rear end, genitals, and inner thighs, while ""'oral thrush'' occurs in the mouth and throat. Adults may get candidal infections in areas of overlapping skin, such as underneath breasts or in skin folds like creases in skin due to fatty tissue.'  "
What causes thrush?,"'An overgrowth of the ''Candida'' species of fungus in the mouth or throat is what causes an oral yeast infection. This overgrowth may be triggered to occur when the person experiences changes such as illness, pregnancy, new medications, or changes in the immune system.''Thrush in infants and newborns is relatively common and is only a concern if it causes poor feeding or is associated with ''weight loss'' or other symptoms of systemic illness. Consult a pediatrician if thrush in an infant lasts more than a couple of weeks.' "
What are risk factors for thrush?,"'Healthy adults generally do not get thrush without having some risk factors. Patients with weakened immune systems are most at risk for getting ''fungal infections'' such as thrush. Risk factors associated with thrush include the following:' Illnesses, including poorly controlled diabetes, HIV/AIDS infection, cancer, and dry mouth Pregnancy Taking medications such as antibiotics, corticosteroids, chemotherapy or other cancer drugs, radiation, and birth control pills Having an organ transplant Smoking Poorly fitting dentures Stress"
Is oral thrush contagious?,"'In general, thrush (or candidiasis) is not ''contagious'"". However, a breast-feeding infant with thrush may transmit it to the mother's breast by contact.""'Technically, oral thrush could be transmitted through kissing or oral sex, though this is uncommon. Thrush is an opportunistic infection, and its development depends on the strength of your immune system.' "
What are thrush symptoms and signs?,"'Thrush is characterized by a white coating or white patches on the tongue, mouth, inner cheeks, and the back of the throat. The tissue under the white patches is often red, raw, and sore. The lesions can be painful and even bleed when scraped. Oral thrush often looks like cottage cheese or milk curds. Some general symptoms and signs of thrush are as follows:''Oral thrush can also lead to a condition called ''burning mouth syndrome'', which can have symptoms of a painful burning sensation, mouth dryness, soreness, tingling or numbness throughout the mouth and tongue, and sometimes an abnormal bitter or ''metallic taste in the mouth''.''In severe cases of thrush, the ''esophagus'', which leads down to the stomach, may also be involved. This will cause ''pain'' with swallowing. If someone has a weakened immune system (''HIV/AIDS'', ''cancer'', chemotherapy, etc.), the ''Candida'' fungus can spread to other parts of the body and cause a systemic infection. If a person has signs or symptoms of thrush and develops a ''fever'', shaking or ''chills'', or ''difficulty swallowing'', contact a doctor immediately.'   Characteristic white patches Redness under the white patches White tongue Cracking at the outer edges of the lips (cheilosis) Dry mouth Feeling of food stuck in the throat or sore throat Soreness in teeth Strange or unpleasant taste in mouth Bad breath"
How do physicians diagnose thrush?,"'Candidiasis is clinically diagnosed by a physician or dentist when the characteristic-looking white patches are found in the mouth or throat.''To confirm the diagnosis, or if there is question about whether the white patches are caused by the ''Candida'' fungus, a scraping may be done. The doctor or dentist can scrape off a small amount of the white matter from the mouth or throat and look at it under a microscope and view the characteristic yeast-shaped fungi.''Thrush located farther down the throat or in the esophagus is usually found by doing a procedure called an ''endoscopy''. In this procedure, the doctor passes a small camera through the back of the throat into the esophagus and into the stomach to observe the tissue and take samples. If the white lesions are found, they may be biopsied or scraped to confirm the diagnosis of thrush. This procedure is usually performed by a ''gastroenterologist''.' "
What is the treatment for thrush?,"'Treatment of thrush depends on the cause and severity of the infection.''If thrush is caused by something reversible, such as taking antibiotics, smoking, ill-fitting dentures, or poorly controlled ''diabetes'', these factors must be corrected as part of the treatment.'""Infants, toddlers, and children with thrush often do not require treatment. In children who have thrush for more than a few weeks, a child's pediatrician may prescribe antifungal ""'nystatin'' (''Mycostatin'', Nilstat, Nystex) drops.''Antifungal medications may be used to treat thrush. If an adult patient is diagnosed with a mild case of thrush, the doctor may prescribe an antifungal mouthwash (nystatin) or lozenges (''clotrimazole'' [Mycelex]) for short-term use. ''Miconazole'' buccal (Oravig) is an antifungal medicine that consists of a tablet placed in the upper gum region and dissolved in the mouth to get rid of thrush.''For more severe cases of thrush or if someone has other reasons for a weakened immune system, he or she may need stronger systemic antifungal medicines, such as ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan'') or ''itraconazole'' (''Sporanox''). These antifungal medicines usually work better than ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral''). For severe or resistant thrush, amphotericin B may be prescribed instead of fluconazole or itraconazole.' "
Are there home remedies for thrush?,"'Home remedies for ''oral candidiasis'' are aimed at decreasing risk factors for thrush as well as preventing overgrowth of ''Candida'' yeast.''Home remedies that may reduce the discomfort of thrush include''Gentian violet (1%) is an ''over-the-counter'' natural treatment that sometimes works as a home remedy for thrush. It is a dye that kills bacteria and fungi, and it is available without a prescription. Talk to a doctor before using gentian violet.''Grapefruit seed extract is sometimes used by ''nursing'' mothers who have developed thrush of the nipples. It can be applied topically (on the skin) to the affected area or taken orally.''Apple cider vinegar has antifungal properties that may help regulate ''Candida'' in the body. Mix 1 tablespoon into 8 oz. water and drink daily.''Baking soda may also help kill the yeast that causes the fungal infection and maintain healthy pH levels in the mouth. Mix 1-2 tablespoons baking soda with water until it forms a paste. Apply the paste with a cotton ball onto the tongue and inner cheeks. Let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse with warm water. Repeat three times a day for several days. Alternately, mix ½ teaspoon baking soda into a glass of water and use as a mouth rinse twice daily.''Raw virgin coconut oil has antifungal properties. Nursing mothers sometimes use it on their nipples and the baby’s mouth to prevent spread of thrush.''Methylene blue'' oral is an antiseptic that is reported to help relieve oral candidiasis. Consult a doctor before using this or any supplement.' Brush the teeth with a soft toothbrush. Rinse the mouth with a diluted 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Rinse the mouth with warm saltwater. Avoid mouthwash as it can alter the normal flora of the mouth. Keep dentures clean and see a dentist if they do not fit correctly. Eat unsweetened yogurt while taking antibiotics. Lactobacillus acidophilus supplements may help maintain a healthy balance of Candida. drinking cold liquids, or eating frozen or ice treats; eating soft, easy-to-swallow foods; and drinking from a straw if the patches are painful."
What types of doctors treat oral thrush?,"""A primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner, internist, or child's pediatrician may diagnose and treat oral thrush. Oral thrush may also be treated by a dentist. Severe infections usually require consultation with an immunologist and/or an infectious-disease specialist."" "
What is the prognosis of thrush?,"'The prognosis of candidiasis and how long it will last depends on the severity of the infection and the status of the immune system of the patient.''Mild cases of thrush caused by some of the reversible risk factors are generally easily treated, and the prognosis is good. Once you have started treatment for oral thrush, symptoms generally go away in about two weeks. In some cases, thrush will last for weeks even with treatment. Recurrent thrush can happen if thrush is not properly treated in the first place.'""Thrush in infants and children is rarely serious or life-threatening and often goes away on its own without any need for medical treatment. If a child's thrush does not improve within two weeks, consult the child's pediatrician.""'Patients with weakened immune systems are at risk for severe and life-threatening complications. These patients can become critically ill or die from severe ''Candida'' infections. ''Candida'' can spread throughout the body to other organs and can cause severe dysfunction. Systemic antifungal treatment in addition to long-term hospitalization may be necessary.' "
Is it possible to prevent thrush?,"'Thrush can be easily prevented in healthy adults by modifying risk factors that contribute to ''Candida'' fungus overgrowth.''Risk factor modifications for ''prevention'' of candidiasis include the following:''To prevent ''thrush in babies'' or nursing infants, keep pacifiers and bottle nipples clean and sterilized. Nursing mothers should discuss the use of any over-the-counter or prescribed medications with their doctor before ''breastfeeding'' as some medications may increase the risk of causing thrush.' Brush and floss teeth and gums regularly, and maintain proper oral hygiene. See a dentist regularly. Make sure dentures are clean, properly maintained, and fit well. Keep diabetes under control. Quit smoking. Eat a balanced, healthy diet low in sugar and yeast. Limit use of antibiotics. Only use as prescribed by a physician. Chlorhexidine (Peridex, Hibiclens) mouthwash may be recommended prevent thrush in people who take immunosuppressant medications."
What is oral thrush?,"'Thrush'' is a ''yeast infection'' of the mouth and throat. ''Thrush'' can also be associated with yeast infections of the ''esophagus''. Thrush appears as creamy white curd-like patches on the tongue and inside of the mouth and back of the throat. As mentioned above, in individuals with impaired immune systems, yeast infections are more common. For example, in a non-infant population, thrush may be a sign of an underlying ''HIV'' infection. The child may not have any symptoms from the condition or may refuse to eat or swallow because of ''pain'' or an unusual feeling in the mouth. Sometimes older children complain of a cottony feeling in the mouth.''Another form of oral ''yeast infection'' is ''angular cheilitis'', which is the development of painful fissures at the corners of the mouth. Yeast infection can also involve the tongue and lead to flattening (erosion) of the papillae of the surface of the tongue, along with ''pain'' and reddening of the tongue (acute atrophic ''candidiasis'').' "
What are yeast infections?,"'What are commonly known as ""yeast"" infections are caused by various species of a yeast-like fungus called ''Candida'', particularly the species ''Candida albicans''. Yeast organisms are some of the germs (including bacteria) that normally reside on various parts of the body and that ordinarily cause no symptoms or signs.' "
Why do yeast sometimes cause symptoms and signs?,"'Certain conditions, such as antibiotic use, may upset the balance of microbes in the body (particularly between the bacteria and fungi) and allow an overgrowth of ''Candida''. Yeast also can thrive in chronically moist folds of skin, such as in the groin.''Yeast infections may flare up and then heal in most people. However, in newborns or individuals with impaired immune systems, yeast can cause more serious or chronic infections.'  "
How do babies get yeast infections?,"'Many infants acquire ''Candida'"" infections from their mothers during the process of birth. Yeast exists naturally in the mother's vagina. The baby comes in direct contact with the yeast during delivery through the birth canal.""'Many ''babies'' who escape this infection at birth soon acquire ''Candida'' from close contact with other family members.' "
What are oral thrush symptoms and signs?,"'Most common ''oral thrush'' symptoms include:' Thrush is characterized by a white coating or white patches on the tongue, mouth, inner cheeks, and the back of the throat.  The tissue under the white patches is often red, raw, and sore. Lesions can be painful and even bleed when scraped.  Oral thrush often looks like cottage cheese or milk curds. Bad breath Cheilosis (Cracking at the outer edges of the lips) Feeling of food stuck in the throat or sore throat Strange or unpleasant taste in the mouth Burning mouth syndrome: Symptoms of a painful burning sensation, mouth dryness, soreness, tingling, or numbness throughout the mouth and tongue. Symptoms can be associated with an abnormal bitter or metallic taste in the mouth. In severe cases of thrush, the esophagus (food pipe), which leads down to the stomach, may also be involved. This will cause pain with swallowing, fever, shaking or chills, or difficulty swallowing."
How do children (and adults) acquire thrush?,"'Outbreaks of thrush in childcare settings may be the result of an increased use of antibiotics and growth of the yeast normally present in the mouth, rather than newly acquired ''Candida'' infections. In children (and adults) taking antibiotics or steroids (such as cortisone-related ''asthma medications''), the balance of the normal microbes in the mouth can be disturbed. This may cause an overgrowth of ''Candida'', which in turn results in oral thrush.'  "
How does yeast affect diaper rash?,"'Candida'"" may infect an infant's ""'diaper'' area and worsen a ''diaper rash''. This is because yeast can grow very readily on irritated, moist skin. The infected skin is usually fiery red with areas that may have a raised red border and is usually intensely ''itchy'' (pruritic).' "
Can thumb sucking cause problems with yeast?,'Children who suck their thumbs or other fingers may occasionally develop ''Candida'' around their fingernails. This causes redness at the edges of the nails.' 
Can a nursing mother acquire yeast infections from her infant?,'Nursing'' mothers are at risk for developing ''Candida'' infections on their breasts (this is called ''mastitis'') and can be treated with the same medication that is used for infants.' 
What is the treatment for thrush and other yeast infections?,"'Health care professionals usually treat oral thrush and yeast infections, such as ''Candida'' ''diaper rash'', with antifungal medicines; these include ''nystatin'' (''Mycostatin''), ''clotrimazole'' (Lotrimin), or ''miconazole'' (''Monistat'') either by mouth or in a topical cream. Luckily, most ''Candida'' are very sensitive to nystatin, and resistance is rare. There are many topical antifungals available as ''over-the-counter'' brands. Oral thrush requires an oral medication that is available by prescription only.''The following tips can help care for children with diaper ''rash'':'   Caregivers should change the child's diapers frequently and gently cleanse the child's skin with water and a mild soap and pat it dry. It is important to minimize skin contact with urine and stool. Allowing periods of exposure to dry air without wearing a diaper can also be helpful. Barrier creams or ointments, such as Desitin or A&D, are helpful. While cornstarch may help mild diaper rash, it should not be used for children with significantly inflamed skin. High-absorbency disposable diapers may help keep the skin dry. A baby's bottom is very sensitive, so staying dry is very important. Avoid plastic pants that do not allow air to circulate over the diaper area. The diapering system should be able to hold urine or liquid feces."
What should caregivers do if the medication does not effectively treat the yeast infection?,"'There are some situations when a child may need a different medication to clear a yeast infection. A health care provider may prescribe another type of antifungal cream or oral preparation that may include ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral'', ''Extina'', ''Xolegel'', ''Kuric''), ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan''), or ''itraconazole'' (''Sporanox'').' "
Should a child with yeast infection be kept out of childcare?,"'There is no need to remove a child with yeast infection from childcare. Since most healthy people already harbor ''Candida'', children with thrush and ''Candida'' diaper rash do not have to be excluded from child care (as long they are able to participate comfortably).''Childcare providers should follow good hygiene, including careful hand washing and disposal of nasal and oral secretions of children with thrush, in order to avoid transmitting the infection to children who may not already be infected.' "
Are there other names for yeast infection?,"'Health care professionals refer to a yeast infection as candidiasis because ''Candida'' causes the infection. Thrush is another name for ''oral candidiasis''. The old name for ''Candida'' was ''Monilia''. The infection is still sometimes called ''moniliasis'', and thrush is still at times known as oral moniliasis.' "
What is thrush?,"'Thrush'' is an infection of the oral mucous membranes (inner lining of the mouth and tongue) by the fungus ''Candida albicans''. Thrush is also termed oral thrush, ''oral candidiasis'', and oropharyngeal ''candidiasis''. Thrush infection is not very common in the healthy population. However, thrush can be present in about 5%-7% of ''babies'' less than 1 month old, in ''AIDS'' patients (about 9%-31%), and in approximately 20% of ''cancer'' patients.'  "
Is thrush contagious?,"'Oral thrush, a fungal infection, is not considered ''contagious''. The causative fungus, ''Candida albicans'', is often already a natural inhabitant of the mouth and throat. When the oral environment changes (usually due to an immature or ''depressed'' immune system), the fungus can multiply and cause symptoms. Occasionally, individuals taking antibiotics or steroids (such as ''prednisone'"") can develop thrush. Although thrush is usually considered not to be contagious, one instance where the fungus can be passed back and forth is between infant and mother. An infant may develop thrush and transfer it to the mother's nipples, which become painful with reddish, cracking skin. Conversely, mothers may develop a ""'Candida albicans'' ''yeast infection'' on their nipples while taking antibiotics or steroids and transfer the infection to their babies while ''breastfeeding''. The incubation period for oral thrush is about two to five days.' "
How will I know if I have thrush?,"'Usually, the first common sign of thrush in adults and children is the presence of whitish raised oral lesions (sometimes resembling cottage cheese). The lesions can be on the tongue, the inside of the cheeks, on the gums, ''tonsils'', or the back of the throat. It can be painful and bleed a little if they are scraped when touched or brushed with a ''toothbrush''. Some people with thrush lose the sense of taste while others have a feeling of cotton in the mouth. Severe thrush can spread to the ''esophagus'' and cause ''fever'', ''difficulty swallowing'', and a feeling like something is caught in the throat. Severe thrush can spread to other parts the body such as the ''lungs'', ''liver'', and skin. Most thrush can be diagnosed by simply observing the characteristic lesions. Scrapings can be used to microscopically identify the fungus. In addition, fungal cultures can document ''Candida albicans''.' "
How is thrush spread?,"'In general, most of the population has some trace levels of ''Candida albicans'"" on the mucous membranes of the mouth. Most the time, the fungus causes little or no problems unless there is a change in the mucous membranes, in a person's immune system, or from taking antibiotics or steroids. These situations allow the fungus to proliferate. Consequently, in most instances, there is no transfer from person to person of thrush. The major exception to this is with infants and their breastfeeding mothers, as they may transfer ""'Candida albicans'' between each other.' "
When will I know if I am cured of thrush?,"'In general, mild to moderate oral thrush infections are treated using antifungal mouthwash or lozenges. The treatment is usually for seven to 14 days. For severe thrush, it is advised to treat for twice as long as the symptoms last (for example, 28-42 days). More severe thrush symptoms and signs may persist for a greater length of time (for example, 14-21 days) before they resolve.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about thrush?,"""Contact your child's pediatrician immediately if your infant has any symptoms of thrush. If an adult individual has symptoms or signs of thrush, they should contact their physician for both care and an examination to determine what underlying causes might be leading to the development of thrush.""'If after seven days of treatment, symptoms not improving or are getting worse, contact a physician. If you have an immune system that is suppressed or altered (''HIV'' infection, ''cancer'', breastfeeding, taking antibiotics) and develop symptoms of thrush, contact a doctor immediately.' "
What are the most common causes of thrush?,"'Thrush'' is a common ''yeast infection'' caused by a yeast called Candida. The\xa0most common strain\xa0of this fungus is\xa0Candida albicans (C. albicans). The mouth and throat are one of the most common sites of Candida infections, which lead to ''oral thrush''. ''Thrush'' is also called ''oral candidiasis'' or oropharyngeal ''candidiasis''. \xa0''Most common causes include:' The immune system and body's normal bacteria usually keep Candida in balance. When this balance is interrupted, it can result in an overgrowth of the Candida fungus, causing thrush. Young babies are more susceptible to oral thrush. Wearing dentures, especially if they are not taken out at night, or not kept clean can cause oral thrush. Antibiotic medicines, steroid tablets, inhalers, and mouthwash can sometimes cause oral thrush. Having a dry mouth due to lack of saliva may cause thrush. Having diabetes, anemia, or lack of vitamins and iron are common causes of oral thrush. Having a poor immune system (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [HIV/AIDS]) may lead to growth of yeast infection. Poor oral hygiene and proper diet may lead to oral thrush. Smokers are more likely to develop oral thrush than other individuals."
What are the most common symptoms of thrush?,"'Most common symptoms include:' Thrush is characterized by a white coating or white patches on the tongue, mouth, inner cheeks, and the back of the throat.  The tissue under the white patches is often red, raw, and sore. Lesions can be painful and even bleed when scraped.  Oral thrush often looks like cottage cheese or milk curds. Bad breath Cheilosis (Cracking at the outer edges of the lips) Feeling of food stuck in the throat or sore throat Strange or unpleasant taste in the mouth Burning mouth syndrome: Symptoms of a painful burning sensation, mouth dryness, soreness, tingling, or numbness throughout the mouth and tongue. Symptoms can be associated with abnormal bitter or metallic taste in the mouth. In severe cases of thrush, the esophagus (food pipe), which leads down to the stomach, may also be involved. This will cause pain with swallowing, fever, shaking or chills, or difficulty swallowing."
How do doctors diagnose oral thrush?,"'Candidiasis is clinically diagnosed by a doctor or dentist when the characteristic-looking white patches are found in the mouth or throat. The doctor or dentist can scrape off a small amount of the white matter from the mouth or throat and look at it under a microscope and view the characteristic yeast-shaped fungi. Thrush located farther down the throat or in the esophagus is usually found by performing a procedure called an\xa0''endoscopy''. In this procedure, the doctor passes a small camera through the back of the throat into the esophagus and into the stomach to observe the tissue and take samples. If the white lesions are found, they may be biopsied or scraped to confirm the diagnosis of thrush. This procedure is usually performed by a\xa0''gastroenterologist''.' "
How to prevent oral thrush?,"'Most common ways to prevent thrush:' Brush the teeth with a soft toothbrush Rinse the mouth with a diluted 3% hydrogen peroxide solution or with warm saltwater Avoid mouthwash Keep dentures clean Maintain oral hygiene Limit foods rich in yeast and sugar Get regular checkups with your dentist Probiotics: Adding probiotic foods, cultured dairy, and/or oral probiotics into routine may help to kill the Candida overgrowth in the body and balance the pH level in the mouth. Vitamin C: Vitamin C helps the immune system by encouraging white blood cell production, which protects the body against infection."
What are the treatment options for thrush?,"'Thrush is a treatable condition:' Mild oral thrush: The usual treatment is Nyamyc (nystatin), which is a topical application that is in liquid drop form. Miconazole mouth gel or lozenges are also effective but may sometimes lead to vomiting or diarrhea. Severe oral thrush: Tablets containing the common antifungal medications Diflucan (fluconazole) or Sporanox (itraconazole) can also clear fungal infections from the body. In rare cases, antifungal injections may be given."
What is thymoma?,"'A thymoma is a rare type of tumor of the thymus gland. The thymus is a gland located in the anterior mediastinum (the area between the two lungs and the sternum in the chest) that plays a critical role in the development of immune cells (lymphocytes) during childhood. The thymus gland enlarges during childhood, peaks in size at puberty (about 40 grams), and then begins to shrink.''Normally, a combination of lymphoid cells (immune cells or lymphocytes) and lining cells (epithelial cells) makes up the thymus. Thymoma is a type of tumor that originates from the epithelial or lining cells of the thymus. The term ''thymic neoplasms'' refers to tumors of the thymus, which consist of thymomas and thymic carcinomas. The term ''thymoma'' refers to tumors of the thymus that grow slowly and usually do not spread beyond the thymus. Thymic carcinomas are tumors of the thymus that grow aggressively and may ''metastasize'' to distant organs. Less than one person per 1.5 million people will develop a thymoma. This means about 400 people per year in the U.S. develop thymoma. Thymic carcinomas are very rare and make up only 0.06% of all thymic tumors.' "
"What causes thymoma, and what are risk factors for thymoma?",'The exact cause of thymomas is unknown. Thymomas are equally common in men and in women and are most frequently seen in the fourth and fifth decades of life. There are no known risk factors that predispose a person to developing thymoma.' 
What are signs and symptoms of thymoma?,"'Up to 50% of thymomas are asymptomatic, meaning they do not produce any symptoms or signs. Physicians may diagnose a thymoma when they perform an imaging study for another reason. In other cases, the tumor may cause symptoms related to the size of the tumor and the pressure it exerts on adjacent organs.''The following symptoms and signs are less common but may occur:''Some cases may spread to the lining of the lungs or heart or even to tissues outside the chest. Less than 7% of cases spread outside the chest cavity. Thymic carcinomas are more aggressive types of tumors than thymomas and are more likely to spread both locally and distantly (metastasize) and to cause symptoms.'   Chest pain, shortness of breath, and cough are common symptoms when symptoms do occur. Fever Night sweats Weight loss"
What other types of medical conditions are associated with thymoma?,"'A number of health conditions have been associated with thymoma. Medical conditions associated with ''cancers'' are paraneoplastic syndromes, and up to 50%-60% of patients with thymoma will have one of these related health conditions. The most commonly associated condition with thymoma is myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease of the nerve-muscle junction that can manifest as ''weakness'', ''fatigue'', ''double vision'', ''ptosis'' (drooping eyelids), and problems with swallowing.''Other associated conditions include other autoimmune diseases including pure red cell aplasia (underproduction of ''red blood cells'' in the bone marrow).' "
What types of specialists treat thymomas?,"'Surgeons, including thoracic (chest) surgeons and surgical oncologists, typically treat thymoma. Medical oncologists and ''radiation'' oncologists may be involved in the treatment team if other treatments indicate an aggressive thymoma or thymic carcinoma.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose a thymoma?,"'If a thymoma is not causing symptoms, health care professionals may identify it incidentally, meaning it is found on an imaging test of the chest (for example, X-ray, ''computerized tomography'' or ''CT scan'') that is performed for another reason. If symptoms are present, health care providers may carry out chest ''X-rays'' or other imaging studies, such as ''CT scans'' or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') scans or the combination of PET and CT scans, to identify the source of the symptoms.''While a mass in the anterior mediastinum can be seen on imaging studies, the definitive diagnosis can only be established when the mass is either removed surgically and examined by a pathologist or when a biopsy (surgical removal of a small portion of tissue for diagnostic purposes) is taken. Microscopic examination of the tumor biopsy tissue is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of thymoma or thymic carcinoma. Health care professionals classify the appearance of the tissue itself under the microscope as type A, B, or C based on its characteristics. Type C thymoma is thymic carcinoma and is quite rare.'  "
What are the stages of thymoma?,"'The stage of a tumor refers to the extent to which it has spread to other local organs and tissues or to other parts of the body. There are two commonly used staging systems for thymoma, both of which classify the tumors as stage 1 through stage 4, depending upon the extent of spread and the degree of tissue invasion. While there are some differences in the two methods used to stage thymomas, a stage 1 tumor represents an encapsulated tumor (surrounded by a capsular structure) that has not spread outside of the thymus gland. Stage 4 represents the opposite extreme, in which invasion and spread to distant organs has occurred. Locally recurrent thymoma refers to the situation in which a tumor returns in the same area after its surgical removal.' "
What are types of treatment options for thymoma?,"'Surgery is the primary treatment for thymoma. The success of the surgery depends upon the particular characteristics of the tumor and its precise location; tumors have a higher surgical cure rate if physicians can remove them completely. If all evidence of disease is unable to be removed and microscopic, or tumor remains after surgery, then radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy ''drugs'' have been used in addition to surgical resection.'  "
What is the prognosis for thymoma?,"'The prognosis (outcome) for thymoma is dependent upon the stage of the tumor as well as the ability to remove the tumor by surgery. Thymic carcinomas tend to behave more aggressively and have a worse prognosis than thymomas. Thymomas tend to be slow-growing tumors, and the prognosis is good to excellent for those with stage 1 or stage 2 thymoma. It is hard to estimate exact survival statistics based on stage because of the low numbers of people diagnosed with this tumor. In a German study of patients whose thymomas were completely removed by surgery, only 3% of the tumors recurred. Even 83% of patients with stage 3 thymoma were alive 10 years after diagnosis. The 10-year survival rate for stage 4 thymoma is approximately 47%. Overall, a majority of thymoma patients will live at least five years, while fewer than half or those with thymic carcinoma are expected to live that long.' "
Is it possible to prevent a thymoma?,"'Because the cause of thymoma is unknown and no risk factors have been identified, prevention of thymoma is not possible.' "
What are thyroid hormones?,"""The thyroid gland produces hormones that are essential for normal body metabolism. Blood testing is now commonly available to determine the adequacy of the levels of thyroid hormones. These blood tests can define whether the thyroid gland's hormone production is normal, overactive, or underactive.""""The thyroid gland is located in the lower part of the neck, below the Adam's apple.The gland wraps around the windpipe (trachea) and has a shape that is similar to a butterfly - formed by two wings (lobes) and attached by a middle part (isthmus). ""'The thyroid gland uses ''iodine'' (mostly available from the ''diet'' in foods such as seafood, bread, and salt) to produce thyroid hormones.' The two most important thyroid hormones are thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which account for 99.9% and 0.1% of thyroid hormones present in the blood respectively. However, the hormone with the most biological activity is T3. Once released from the thyroid gland into the blood, a large amount of T4 is converted into T3 - the active hormone that affects the metabolism of cells."
What are normal thyroid hormone levels?,"'The thyroid itself is regulated by another gland that is located in the brain, called the pituitary. In turn, the pituitary is regulated in part by the thyroid (via a ""feedback"" effect of ''thyroid hormone'' on the ''pituitary gland'') and by another gland called the hypothalamus.''The hypothalamus releases a hormone called thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which sends a signal to the pituitary to release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). In turn, TSH sends a signal to the thyroid to release thyroid hormones. If a disruption occurs at any of these levels, a defect in thyroid hormone production may result in a deficiency of thyroid hormone (''hypothyroidism'').''Hypothalamus - TRH''↓''Pituitary - TSH''↓''Thyroid - T4 and T3''The rate of thyroid hormone production is controlled by the pituitary gland. If there is an insufficient amount of thyroid hormone circulating in the body to allow for normal functioning, the release of TSH is increased by the pituitary gland in an attempt to stimulate more thyroid hormone production. In contrast, when there is an excessive amount of circulating thyroid hormone, TSH levels fall as the pituitary attempts to decrease the production of thyroid hormone.' In persons with hypothyroidism (thyroid hormone production is below normal), there is a continuously decreased level of circulating thyroid hormones. In persons with hyperthyroidism (thyroid hormone production is above normal), there is a continuously elevated level of circulating thyroid hormones."
What are the types of thyroid disorders?,'The most common ''thyroid disorders'' include:'   Thyroid nodules Hashimoto's thyroiditis Hyperparathyroidism Thyroid cancer Thyroiditis Hyperthyroidsm Hypothyroidism Graves' disease
What procedures and tests diagnose thyroid problems?,"'Blood tests are used to diagnose hypothyroidism or ''hyperthyroidism'"". They do not point to a specific cause. In order to determine a cause of the thyroid abnormality, the doctor will consider the patient's history, physical examination, and medical condition. Further testing might be used to isolate an underlying cause. These tests might include more blood testing for""'If ''thyroid cancer'' is suspected and surgery may be required, your physician may ask for a blood test known as thyroglobulin.'   thyroid antibodies, nuclear medicine thyroid scanning, ultrasound of the thyroid gland, or others. Thyroglobulin is a protein made only by thyroid cells. If the thyroglobulin level at baseline is detectable or elevated (this means the gland does in fact make the protein) it can be used as a tumor marker. After a total thyroidectomy for cancer (removal of the entire thyroid gland) the level should fall to an undetectable range since the cells that make thyroglobulin have been removed. If the level remains detectable after surgery, there is a possibility of thyroid tissue elsewhere in the body, and metastatic disease should be considered. If the level is undetectable for a period of time after surgery and then starts to climb, a recurrence of the cancer - either at the primary site or elsewhere in the body should be considered."
What is the thyroid?,"'The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of the neck and is most well-known and responsible for producing ''thyroid hormone'"", the chemical in the body that is responsible for regulating the body's metabolism. It has two lobes, right and left, that are connected by a fibrous ""'bridge'' called the isthmus.''Parafollicular cells'' in the thyroid produce the thyroid hormone. Too much thyroid production can cause ''hyperthyroidism'' (hyper=too much) where a person can experience rapid heartbeat and ''palpitations'', ''sweating'', heat intolerance, ''weight loss'', and ''anxiety''. ''Hypothyroidism'' (hypo=too little) may cause lethargy, ''weight gain'', hair thinning, gravelly voice, and ''cold'' intolerance. The ''pituitary gland'' in the brain controls the amount of thyroid hormone that is produced by secreting thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).''C cells'' in the thyroid produce a hormone called ''calcitonin'' that helps to regulate calcium levels in the body.''Other cells that are found in the thyroid include ''lymphocytes'"" that are part of the body's immune system and stromal cells that help support the architecture of the thyroid gland itself."" "
What is thyroid cancer?,"'Thyroid cancer affects more than 20,000 people in the U.S. every year but accounts for only 1% of new ''cancers'' that are diagnosed. Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer.''DNA (mutations) that occur spontaneously or in response to an environmental exposure or a toxic substance can alter normal thyroid cells. The genetic changes cause the cells to multiply very rapidly without the normal controls found in the rest of the gland. Any of the cell types found in the thyroid gland can mutate into a specific type of cancer.''Cancer is different than ''goiter'"", an enlargement of the thyroid gland that may be associated with hyper or hypothyroidism. Worldwide, the most common cause of goiter is iodine deficiency. In countries where table salt is iodinated, the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's ""'thyroiditis'', is the most common cause. '""Graves' disease""', another autoimmune disease, can also be associated with thyroid enlargement.''Research from the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) has found that while the number of thyroid cancers being diagnosed has increased in the past 30 years, the death rate from thyroid cancer has remained the same. This suggests that there are not more cancers occurring but instead health care professionals and patients have become better at finding lumps in the thyroid gland and making the diagnosis.' "
What causes thyroid cancer?,"'The exact cause of thyroid cancer is not known, though there are factors that may be associated with an increased risk of developing the cancer. Even if the risk factors are present, there is not a way of knowing whether cancer might develop; patients without risk factors still may develop thyroid cancer.' "
What are the risk factors for thyroid cancer?,"'Most solitary ''thyroid nodules'' (lumps) are benign, but the risk of cancer increases if they occur in people younger than 30 or older than 60.''Women are three times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men and at a slightly younger age (40 to 50 years old for women versus 60 to 70 for men).''A solitary nodule found in a male is more likely to be cancerous than a solitary nodule found in a female.''A rapidly growing nodule is more likely to be cancerous and is an ominous sign.''X-rays and CT scans of the neck use low doses of radiation but medical testing has not been found to cause thyroid cancer. Nevertheless, in general, it is important to limit the amount of exposures to the least amount of radiation that will provide a clear enough image to help make a diagnosis.''Diets low in iodine may increase the risk of thyroid cancer, but in developed countries, there is usually enough iodine used as food additives so that this is not a problem. Lower levels of iodine in the ''diet'' may enhance the risk of radiation induced thyroid cancer.''There may be a relationship between poorly controlled ''diabetes'' and an increased risk of thyroid cancer.''Children who have had radiation exposure to the neck are at higher risk for thyroid cancer. Studies have looked at children who were given radiation treatments 50-60 years ago when the risks of radiation where less well understood, and their rate of thyroid cancer is increased. Children and women survivors of nuclear reactor accidents (Chernobyl in 1986 has been studied) have an increased risk of thyroid and other types of cancer.''Agent orange exposure may increase the risk of developing thyroid cancer.''There may be a genetic predisposition to thyroid cancer, especially in certain rare types of thyroid cancer.''While ''smoking'' is associated with ''thyroid disease'', worsening hypothyroidism and being a risk factor for '""Graves' disease""', ''smoking'' does not appear to increase the risk of thyroid cancer.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of thyroid cancer?,"""Most often, a thyroid cancer is found when the patient or the patient's health care professional feels (palpates) a lump or nodule in the lower front of the neck where the thyroid is located. It is most often painless and found incidentally, by chance. Occasionally, an enlarged ""'lymph node'' may be palpated by itself in the more lateral neck or in addition to a thyroid nodule.''Most patients have normal thyroid function at the time the nodule is discovered and have no symptoms related to hyper or hypothyroidism.''If the tumor grows large enough, it can affect nearby structures. There may be ''difficulty swallowing'' food (''dysphagia'') if the tumor compresses the ''esophagus'', but this is rare. If the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which controls the vocal cords, is involved, ''hoarseness'' may develop due to vocal cord ''paralysis''.''In children, lumps in the neck are found frequently. Most often they are not in the thyroid gland itself. Aside from ''swollen lymph nodes'' associated with infections like ''pharyngitis'', ''strep throat'', or an ''ear infection'' (''otitis media''), lumps should not be ignored. In pediatric patients, thyroid cancer is the third most common solid tumor malignancy and the most common endocrine malignancy. The first sign might be a lump that is felt in the thyroid gland.'  "
What are thyroid nodules?,"'A thyroid nodule is an abnormal growth found within the thyroid gland. It may be solid, fluid filled (cystic) -- usually with a jelly like substance called colloid -- or a combination of both.''Most often nodules are found incidentally when the patient or health care professional feels the neck. Whether the nodule is benign or cancerous cannot necessarily be determined just by feeling it and further tests may be warranted.' "
What are the different types of thyroid cancer?,"'Thyroid malignancies are classified based upon which cell type is involved.''Well differentiated cancers (in which thyroid cells are less abnormal looking) include:' Papillary thyroid carcinoma: This is the most common type of thyroid cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer accounts for 80% of cases. Hürthle cell carcinoma: This is a rare variant of papillary cancer (also known as oncocytic carcinoma). Follicular thyroid carcinoma: Follicular cancer is the second most common type of thyroid cancer. The follicular variety accounts for 10% of cases. Medullary thyroid carcinoma: This thyroid cancer type arises from the C cells in the thyroid 
	that produce calcitonin. Medullary thyroid cancers (MTC) comprise 5% of all cases.There may be a genetic predisposition to MTC, known as familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC).FMTC may just appear with MTC alone.FMTC may be seen as part of a syndrome called multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), either type 2A or 2B, in which other organs also develop cancers. There may be a genetic predisposition to MTC, known as familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC). FMTC may just appear with MTC alone. FMTC may be seen as part of a syndrome called multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN), either type 2A or 2B, in which other organs also develop cancers. Anaplastic thyroid cancer: This rare cancer involves thyroid cells are very abnormal looking, accounting for 1% of all cases. Lymphoma: This rare cancer is most often non-Hodgkin's B cell type. Sarcoma: This type of thyroid cancer is very rare."
How do health care professionals diagnose thyroid cancer?,"'The diagnosis of thyroid cancer often occurs before symptoms develop, when a lump is discovered in the thyroid gland. This may occur on routine physical exam of the neck by a health care provider, or it may be found by the patient.''Once a lump in the thyroid is discovered, it is important to know whether it is benign or ''malignant'' (cancerous).''An ''ultrasound'' usually is performed to assess whether there is a single nodule or whether multiple nodules are present. Ultrasound can determine whether the nodule is fluid filled or solid. Ultrasound also can determine the general appearance of thyroid looking for inflammation or irregularities and the presence of nearby ''enlarged lymph nodes'' that may represent metastatic cancer.''Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is usually the next step. It is a procedure performed to obtain a sample of cells from the nodule to determine if it is cancerous. Using ultrasound, a thin needle is placed into the nodule and cells from the nodule are obtained. These cells can be examined under a microscope by a pathologist to determine whether a cancer is present and if so, what type of cancer it is.''Sometimes, the results of the aspiration are unclear or indeterminate, and the aspiration may need to be repeated to get a better sample and more cells to study.''Guidelines developed by the American Thyroid Association help the provider interpret the results of the ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy. When evaluated together, the test results give direction as to whether the nodule is benign or malignant (cancerous), and help inform the choice of treatment options.''Radio-iodine testing may be considered if the results of the FNAB don\'t provide a definite answer as to whether a nodule is benign or malignant. The patient swallows some radioactive iodine which is taken up by the thyroid gland. The gland is scanned by a Geiger counter-type apparatus that determines how much radioactive iodine has been taken up by the thyroid gland and any thyroid nodules. If the nodule picks up much of the iodine, it is referred to as a ""hot nodule."" Hot nodules are rarely cancerous. Nodules that take up little to no iodine are referred to as ""cold nodules."" Although the overwhelming majority of cold nodules are benign, 5% turn out to be malignant.''Although thyroid scans may be helpful, it is not a first-line test and fine needle aspiration of the gland is a much more useful test. There is an exception. In the patient with a thyroid nodule whose TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level is low, the next step may be a radio-iodine test. The risk for cancer in a patient who is hyperthyroid (low TSH) and who has a ""hot nodule"" is very low and biopsy may not be required.''Blood tests may be ordered to determine the function of the thyroid gland. Measuring blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secreted by the pituitary gland turns out to be very effective in determining thyroid function, including whether the patient is hyperthyroid or hypothyroid.''Calcitonin levels may be increased in medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), but because MTC is very rare, this test is not recommended to screen for cancer.''MTC, FMTC, and MEN are hereditary cancers. Genetic testing may be done in family members of people with these types of cancers. As well, other blood tests may be ordered, including CEA, RET proto-oncogene, calcium, and calcitonin. Screening for other associated diseases might include tests looking for a tumor known as ''pheochromocytoma''.' "
What are treatment options for thyroid cancer?,"'Thyroid cancer treatment usually requires surgery to remove the tumor. Two options are available, and decisions as to which option to pursue depend upon the clinical situation. Guidelines from the American Thyroid Association and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network can help the surgeon and patient decide on the best type of surgery for the situation.'   Lobectomy: The thyroid has two lobes joined in the middle with a fibrous tissue bridge called the isthmus. If the tumor is confined to only a small area, the surgeon may just remove the affected lobe. Total thyroidectomy: This is the most common surgery for thyroid cancer and the goal is to completely remove the thyroid gland and hopefully ensure that the cancer will not recur. Lymph node resection: Thyroid cancer can spread to local lymph nodes, and these nodes often are removed. Affected lymph nodes may only be recognized at the time of surgery. Open biopsy: Sometimes, the cancerous nature of a thyroid nodule is unclear, even after fine needle aspiration. A surgeon may operate to remove the nodule and send all the tissue for evaluation by a pathologist to make the diagnosis of cancer."
Thyroid hormone,"'If the thyroid gland has been removed, the body will no longer be able to make thyroid hormone, and daily thyroid hormone replacement will be necessary. Routine thyroid hormone blood tests will need to be performed to ensure there is an adequate amount of thyroid hormone to allow the body to function properly. Thyroid hormone replacement will be lifelong in total thyroidectomy patients.' "
"Radioactive iodine (radioiodine, 
I-131)",'Iodine is routinely absorbed by thyroid tissue. Radioiodine may be administered after surgery to destroy any remnant thyroid tissue remaining after thyroidectomy. The decision to use this treatment depends upon the type and extent of the thyroid cancer and the levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) produced by the pituitary gland.' 
Radiation,"'In certain thyroid cancers, where the tumor does not take up iodine, radiation therapy may be considered in place of radioactive iodine. Radioactive iodine update tests performed before surgery can assess whether or not iodine is taken up by the thyroid gland.' "
Chemotherapy,'Chemotherapy is not commonly used for most thyroid cancers but may be used in certain clinical situations when the thyroid cancer does not respond to other treatments.' 
What kind of support is available for those with thyroid cancer?,"""Patients, families, and friends are all affected by a diagnosis of cancer is made. Support is available not only for the patient but for all those who are close to the patient. Hospitals, clinics, and health care professionals' offices often have specially trained staff to help patients and families address their physical, emotional, and spiritual needs.""'It is important for the patient and family to understand the disease, the treatment options, the expected outcomes, and the journey that will occur with cancer. Family members will benefit from being present for provider visits during the diagnosis and treatment, as well as with follow-up appointments. This allows all to be involved in advocating for the patient, since there is so much information to understand and absorb; it can be overwhelming.''There are many community resources available as well. The ''American Cancer Society'' is a good place to begin. They have local offices and may be contacted online.' "
What is the prognosis for patients with thyroid cancer? What is the survival rate for patients with thyroid cancer?,"'There are many types of thyroid cancer, and outcome depends upon the type of thyroid cancer, its stage, and the type of thyroid cancer treatment received.''Patients who have papillary or follicular cancer that is confined to the thyroid gland may expect a normal life expectancy with treatment. Prognosis may be better for women who are younger than 40 years of age.''Patients with anaplastic cancer do poorly, with many surviving only a few months after diagnosis. The five-year survival rate for this cancer is less than 10%.' "
What is the likelihood of thyroid cancer recurrence?,"'The recurrence rate of thyroid cancer depends upon whether the cancer remains localized within the thyroid gland or whether it has spread or metastasized to local structures in the neck or to distant sites in the body.''In general, the recurrence risk of a cancer that has not spread is very low. For example, Italian researchers found that among patients with papillary cancer of the thyroid gland, those with a low risk of disease had a recurrence rate of about 1.4% at eight years.''Researchers from the Mayo Clinic followed patients for up to 15 years and concluded that low risk patients had a recurrence rate of 3%-5%. However, they noted that more recently, thyroid cancer was being diagnosed much earlier and with the appropriate surgery, cure was much more likely and survival rate after surgery was very high.' "
Is it possible to prevent thyroid cancer?,'There is little one can do to prevent thyroid cancer aside from avoiding excessive exposure to radiation.' 
What is the latest research on thyroid cancer?,"'Research continues regarding the best treatment for the different types of thyroid cancers. New ''drugs'' are being developed that specifically target the thyroid cancer cells by attacking specific genes or proteins.''MTC (medullary thyroid cancer) research and treatments include developing anti-cancer antibodies and attaching them to radioactive iodine to be injected into the body so that the combination molecule is taken up by the thyroid gland and then specifically attaches to and destroys cancer cells.''Clinical trials'' continue to enroll patients with many diseases, including thyroid cancer. If appropriate, your health care professional may be a resource in finding a clinical trial that may be beneficial. Clinical trials that are enrolling patients can be found at the U.S. National Cancer Institute web site (''https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search'').' "
What is thyroid disease?,"'Hyperthyroidism''\xa0or overactive thyroid can be caused by a condition known as Graves’ disease, inflammation of the thyroid gland (known as\xa0''thyroiditis''), or by tumors that secrete thyroid hormones.''Thyroid disease'' is common. ''Thyroid disease'' can result from conditions that cause over-or under-function of the thyroid gland.'   When the gland produces too much thyroid hormone, the condition is known as hyperthyroidism. When the gland does not function sufficiently, there is too little thyroid hormone produced (hypothyroidism). In addition to problems with the level of hormones made by the gland, both benign and malignant tumors (cancers) can cause enlargement of the thyroid gland or nodules (lumps) within the gland. Enlargement of the thyroid gland in the neck can cause symptoms that are directly related to the increase in the size of the organ (such as difficulty swallowing and discomfort in front of the neck)."
What is the thyroid gland? Where is it located and what does it look like?,"""The thyroid gland is a metabolism hormone-producing gland in the lower part of the neck, below Adam's apple. It has two lobes attached to one another by a middle part called the isthmus and is located in front of the trachea. The thyroid produces essential hormones required by the body that help regulate metabolism, ""'heart'' rate, ''blood pressure'', and temperature. Thyroid hormones are also necessary for children to grow and develop.''Thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are the two most important hormones made by the thyroid. The gland also makes ''calcitonin'', a hormone involved in calcium metabolism. A hormone made by the ''pituitary gland'' called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) acts to stimulate hormone production by the thyroid gland.'""The thyroid gland is located below Adam's apple wrapped around the trachea (windpipe), and it has a butterfly shape. A thin area of tissue in the gland's middle, known as the isthmus, joins the two thyroid lobes on each side. The thyroid uses ""'iodine'"" to produce vital hormones. Thyroxine, also known as T4, is the primary hormone produced by the gland. After delivery via the bloodstream to the body's tissues, a small portion of the T4 released from the gland is converted to triiodothyronine (T3), which is the most active hormone."" "
What are the symptoms and signs of the different types of thyroid problems?,"'Just as the types of thyroid conditions can vary (for example, ''hypothyroidism'', ''hyperthyroidism'', Hashimoto’s ''thyroiditis'', goiters, Grave’s disease, and ''cancer''), so can the symptoms and signs of each thyroid problem.' "
"12 Hyperthyroidism symptoms and signs (Graves' disease, thyroiditis, tumors)","'Hyperthyroidism'' or overactive thyroid can be caused by a condition known as Graves’ disease, inflammation of the thyroid gland (known as thyroiditis), or by tumors that secrete thyroid hormones.'   Nervousness, tremor, agitation Irritability Poor concentration Reduced menstrual blood flow in women Racing heartbeat or palpitations Heat intolerance Changes in bowel habits, such as more frequent bowel movements Enlargement of the thyroid gland Skin thinning Brittle hair Increase in appetite, feeling hungry Sweating"
"15 Hypothyroidism symptoms and signs (Hashimoto's disease, cancer treatment side effects)","'Inadequate functioning of the thyroid gland produces too little thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism). An autoimmune condition known as Hashimoto’s disease or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is a common cause of hypothyroidism. Other causes can include the use of certain medications, side effects of treatments for ''thyroid cancer'' or hyperthyroidism, or ''radiation therapy'' to the head and neck.'   Mental fogginess or sluggishness Depressed mood Excessive or prolonged menstrual bleeding Fluid retention, feeling bloated, puffiness in the face Joint aches and pains Weight gain High cholesterol levels Feeling cold, or increased sensitivity to cold temperatures Hoarseness Dry skin Constipation Fatigue Memory problems Thinning hair or hair loss Slowed heart rate"
3 Thyroid nodule or cancer symptoms and signs,"'Nodules or lumps in the thyroid gland are benign (non-cancerous) in over 90% of cases. ''Thyroid nodules'' can form because of some of the conditions listed previously and lead to hyper- or hypothyroidism, for example:'  Hashimoto’s thyroiditis Iodine deficiency can also cause enlargement of the thyroid gland and thyroid nodules, now rare in the United States. Cysts in the thyroid gland can also cause lumps or nodules. A small number of thyroid nodules are the result of thyroid cancer. Most thyroid nodules do not cause symptoms, and most do not produce thyroid hormone. Sometimes, nodules actively produce hormones and can cause the symptoms of hyperthyroidism described previously. Difficulty swallowing Shortness of breath, due to compression of the airways A visible swelling or lump in the neck"
What should you do if you think you have signs and symptoms of a thyroid disorder? Which type of doctors treat thyroid problems?, Thyroid disease is a broad spectrum of disorders that may or may not lead to enlargement of the thyroid gland itself or the presence of lumps or nodules. Signs and symptoms of thyroid disease are apparent when the gland is over- or under-producing thyroid hormone. It is important to remember that none of these symptoms described in this article is specific for thyroid disease. A number of different conditions and normal states may cause all of them. Your doctor or endocrinologist (a doctor that specializes in thyroid problems and other endocrine problems) can order laboratory tests to evaluate the function of your thyroid gland if you have troubling symptoms.
What are thyroid disorders?,"'Thyroid disorders are conditions that affect the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of the neck. The thyroid has important roles to regulate numerous metabolic processes throughout the body. Different types of thyroid disorders affect either its structure or function.'""The thyroid gland is located below the Adam's apple wrapped around the trachea (windpipe). A thin area of tissue in the gland's middle, known as the isthmus, joins the two thyroid lobes on each side. The thyroid uses ""'iodine'"" to produce vital hormones. Thyroxine, also known as T4, is the primary hormone produced by the gland. After delivery via the bloodstream to the body's tissues, a small portion of the T4 released from the gland is converted to triiodothyronine (T3), which is the most active hormone.""'The function of the thyroid gland is regulated by a feedback mechanism involving the brain. When ''thyroid hormone'' levels are low, the hypothalamus in the brain produces a hormone known as thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) that causes the ''pituitary gland'' (located at the base of the brain) to release thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to release more T4.''Since the thyroid gland is controlled by the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, disorders of these tissues can also affect thyroid function and cause thyroid problems.'  "
What are the specific kinds of thyroid disorders?,"'There are specific kinds of thyroid disorders that includes:'

   Hypothyroidism Hyperthyroidism Goiter Thyroid nodules Thyroid cancer"
Hypothyroidism,"'Hypothyroidism results from the thyroid gland producing an insufficient amount of thyroid hormone. It can develop from problems within the thyroid gland, pituitary gland, or hypothalamus. ''Symptoms of hypothyroidism'' can include:''Some common causes of hypothyroidism include:'   Fatigue Poor concentration or feeling mentally ""foggy"" Dry skin Constipation Feeling cold Fluid retention Muscle and joint aches Depression Prolonged or excessive menstrual bleeding in women Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition that causes inflammation of the thyroid gland) Thyroid hormone resistance Other types of thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid), such as acute thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis"
Hyperthyroidism,"'Hyperthyroidism'' describes excessive production of thyroid hormone, a less common condition than hypothyroidism. Symptoms of hypothyroidism usually relate to increased metabolism. In mild cases, there may not be apparent symptoms. Symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism can include:''Some of the most common causes of hyperthyroidism are:'   Tremor Nervousness Fast heart rate Fatigue Intolerance for heat Increase in bowel movements Increased sweating Concentration problems Unintentional weight loss Graves' disease Toxic multinodular goiter Thyroid nodules that overexpress thyroid hormone (known as ""hot"" nodules) Excessive iodine consumption"
Goiter,"'A goiter simply describes enlargement of the thyroid gland, regardless of cause. A goiter is not a specific disease per se. A goiter may be associated with hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or normal thyroid function.'  "
Thyroid nodules,"'Nodules are lumps or abnormal masses within the thyroid. Nodules can be caused by benign ''cysts'', benign tumors, or, less commonly, by ''cancers'' of the thyroid. Nodules may be single or multiple and can vary in size. If nodules are excessively large, they may cause symptoms related to compression of nearby structures.'  "
Thyroid cancer,"'Thyroid cancer'' is far more common among adult women than men or youth. About 2/3 of cases occur in people under age 55. There are different kinds of thyroid ''cancer'', depending upon the specific cell type within the thyroid that has become cancerous. Most cases of thyroid ''cancer'' have a good prognosis and high survival rates, especially when diagnosed in its early stages.' "
How are thyroid disorders diagnosed?,"'In addition to thorough medical history and physical exam, specialized tests are used to diagnose thyroid disorders.''Blood tests are typically done to measure levels of thyroid hormones and TSH. Blood tests to identify antibodies against thyroid tissue may also be ordered by your doctor, such as titers of anti-thyroglobulin, anti-thyroperoxidase, or ''TSH receptor'' stimulating antibodies.''Imaging tests are commonly used when thyroid nodules or enlargement are present. ''Ultrasound'' can visualize the consistency of the tissue within the gland and can often reveal cysts or calcifications. Ultrasound examination cannot distinguish a benign from a ''malignant'' process.''Thyroid scans using radioactive iodine are often performed to evaluate the function of thyroid nodules. The thyroid is the only location in the body that takes up iodine, so when radioactively labeled iodine is given, it is taken up by the thyroid gland. An imaging test typically shows uptake of radioactive iodine by normal thyroid tissue. Areas or nodules that are producing excess hormone (referred to as hyperfunctioning) will show an increased uptake of iodine. These are referred to as ""hot"" nodules or areas. By contrast, so-called ""cold"" nodules represent areas with decreased iodine uptake. ""Cold"" nodules do not produce excess hormone and can sometimes represent ''cancer''.'""Fine needle aspiration and biopsy are techniques that remove a sample of cells or tissue from the thyroid gland for examination and diagnosis by a pathologist, who is a physician trained in the diagnosis of conditions based on tissue samples. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) uses a long, thin needle to withdraw a sample of cells from the thyroid. FNA can be performed in the doctor's office. Sometimes, ultrasound imaging is used to guide the FNA procedure. A biopsy is the surgical sampling of a tissue.""  "
What is the treatment for thyroid disorders?,"'Thyroid disorders can be treated by medications or, in some cases, surgery. Treatment will depend on the particular disease of the thyroid.'

  "
Thyroid medications,"'Medications can be given to replace the missing thyroid hormone in hypothyroidism. Synthetic thyroid hormone is given in pill form by mouth. When hyperthyroidism is present, medications can be used to decrease production of thyroid hormone or prevent its release from the gland. Other medications can be given to help manage the ''symptoms of hyperthyroidism'', such as increased heart rate. If hyperthyroidism is not controlled with medications, radioactive ablation can be performed. Ablation involves giving doses of iodine labeled with radioactivity that selectively destroys the thyroid tissue.' "
Thyroid surgery,"""Surgery can be used to remove a large goiter or a hyperfunctioning nodule within the gland. Surgery is necessary when there is a possibility of thyroid cancer. If the thyroid gland is removed entirely, the individual will need to take synthetic thyroid hormone for life. Thyroid surgery can also be used in Graves' Disease (subtotal ""'thyroidectomy'') and was the treatment of choice prior to RAI therapy and anti-thyroid medications. It is not used much now.'  "
What is the outlook for thyroid disorders?,"'In most cases, thyroid disorders can be well managed with medical treatment and are not life threatening. Some conditions may require surgery. The outlook for most people with thyroid cancer is also good, although patients with thyroid cancer that has spread throughout the body have a poorer prognosis.' "
What are thyroid nodules?,"'The thyroid gland is found in the neck just below the ""Adam\'s apple."" This gland is responsible for producing ''thyroid hormone'', which is an important hormone that stimulates the metabolism of the body.  ''Thyroid nodules'' are so common that up to half of all people have one, without any symptoms or effect. Like many things, the thyroid gland gets ""lumpier"" as we get older and the frequency of these nodules increases with age. In fact, many are found incidentally during routine examinations or radiology testing. Thyroid nodules are also more common in women than in men. Interestingly, because women have so many more nodules than men, the incidence of detected ''cancer'' is higher in women than in men by virtue of absolute numbers. However, each individual nodule is more likely to be cancerous if found in a man.''Doctors always hold a degree of concern whenever a new growth is detected on the body, regardless of the tissue involved. The concern is whether or not the growth or nodule is ''cancer''. Fortunately, fewer than 10% of thyroid nodules are malignant. The majority of thyroid nodules are harmless growths, known as adenomas, and are contained within a capsule. Even though cancerous nodules are uncommon, the doctor will take the necessary  measures to be certain.' "
What is the initial assessment of a thyroid nodule?,"'All patients with a thyroid nodule should undergo a complete medical history and physical examination. Specific questions regarding the onset of the nodule, related ''pain'' or discomfort, symptoms of ''thyroid disease'"", and family history are addressed. In addition, the doctor will take into account the patient's age and sex when evaluating the possibility of ""'malignancy'"". Patients with a history of head and neck radiation (which was commonly used in the 1950's as an ""'acne''\xa0treatment) are at a higher risk. Cancerous nodules are also more frequent in men as compared to women. The doctor will also look for general symptoms of thyroid disease in addition to other illnesses. The size and characteristics of the nodule are assessed. Is it soft or firm? Does it move with swallowing, or is it fixed? Is there more than one nodule? Are there other nodes involved? Does it hurt when the nodule is touched? The answers to these questions will help the doctor evaluate what further investigations, if any, are necessary.''The following is a list of factors that increase the suspicion of malignancy:''Nodules are less concerning to a physician if it is one of many present in the gland, and also if the nodule is hyperfunctioning (or ""hot"") using nuclear thyroid imaging.''After the initial evaluation, the doctor may choose to order ''thyroid blood tests'' or imaging scans to determine the functional activity of a thyroid nodule and its anatomy. The cornerstone in the assessment of a solitary thyroid nodule is a procedure known as fine needle aspiration biopsy (""FNAB"") of the thyroid gland.' Age: Patients less than 30 years of age and greater than 60 years of age have a higher risk of cancer in a thyroid nodule as do children; Associated symptoms such as difficulty swallowing or hoarseness; History of head and neck irradiation; A hard, fixed nodule on examination; Surrounding enlarged lymph nodes; and Previous history of thyroid cancer in the family."
Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the thyroid gland; why is it done?,"'A biopsy to obtain tissue for analysis is the best technique for detecting or ruling out the presence of cancer. For many years, a core biopsy of the thyroid was the procedure of choice. This method involved a large biopsy, which was often more difficult for patients. fine needle aspiration biopsy has now become the method of choice for obtaining samples of thyroid tissue. The procedure is technically quite simple. When performed properly, the testing  has a false negative rate of less than 5%. This means that a positive finding, such as cancer, will be missed fewer than five times out of 100.''The fine needle aspiration is also performed to treat thyroid cysts. A ''thyroid cyst'' is a fluid-filled sac within the thyroid gland. Aspiration of the ''cyst'' with a needle and syringe can shrink the swelling from the ''cyst'' and the fluid removed can be analyzed for cancer.'  "
Should fine needle aspiration biopsy be done on all thyroid nodules?,"'There are certain situations in which your physician may elect not to perform a biopsy of a nodule. For example, in a patient with an over- active thyroid (''hyperthyroidism''), the chance for a nodule to be cancerous is significantly less, particularly if other studies (such as nuclear thyroid imaging) show that the nodule is producing thyroid hormone (a ""hot"" nodule).''A doctor may recommend fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid in the following situations:' To make a diagnosis of a thyroid nodule; To help select therapy for a thyroid nodule; To drain a cyst that may be causing pain; or To inject a medication to shrink a recurrent cyst."
How is fine needle aspiration biopsy performed?,"'In most cases, if the nodule can be felt, a biopsy can be performed in the doctors office. In some cases an ''ultrasound'' may be needed to help guide the biopsy, (for example, if the nodule cannot be felt without difficulty or if the nodule has areas within it that specifically should be biopsied).''Little preparation by the patient is required. There is no need to fast or to withhold medications on the day of the biopsy. Occasionally, though, a patient may be asked not to take blood thinning medication either before or on the day of the biopsy. After an examination to pinpoint the nodule, the patient is asked to lie down and the neck is exposed. Depending on the location of the nodule and the type of clothes the patient is wearing, he or she may be asked to change into a gown. The doctor drapes the area around the neck and cleans the neck off. This is usually done with ''iodine'', which is a brown liquid that sterilizes the skin. Some doctors may choose to inject a local anesthetic. Often, the injection of the anesthetic results in an initial discomfort, like a ''bee sting''. The majority of doctors who regularly perform fine needle aspiration biopsies of the thyroid do not use a local anesthetic for this reason. Since the needle used for fine needle aspiration biopsy is so fine, anesthesia often results in simply another uncomfortable poke for the patient. If a patient is particularly concerned and nervous, a topical anesthetic preparation may be applied, which takes 10 to 20 minutes to work, thus prolonging the procedure. A patient undergoing fine needle aspiration biopsy should discuss any preferences for local anesthetic before the procedure begins. Most patients undergoing fine needle aspiration biopsy forego the use of any anesthetic and do very well.''Once the patient is ready, a small, fine-gauge needle is inserted into the nodule. The needle is smaller in diameter than the needle used in most blood draws (usually a 25 gauge 1.5 inch needle). The patient holds his breath while the needle is rocked gently to obtain as much tissue as possible. (The reason for holding the breath is to minimize movement of the structures in the neck.) The needle is then withdrawn and pressure is applied over the thyroid area to minimize bleeding. This procedure is usually repeated four to six times to ensure that an adequate amount of tissue has been collected. After the procedure, pressure is applied over the neck area for 5 to 10 minutes to assure that the bleeding has stopped. The pressure also helps to reduce any swelling that may occur. The entire procedure usually takes less than 20 minutes.' "
What are the complications of fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid?,"'Most patients notice very little bleeding or swelling. There may be some discomfort in the area for a few hours after the biopsy, which is usually relieved with ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''). Some patients like to put an ice pack over the area when they get home, but most do well without such measures. The risks of  fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid include bleeding, infection, and cyst formation, but these complications are exceedingly rare. Patients should contact their doctor if they notice any excessive ''bruising'' or swelling in the area of the biopsy, if they have persistent pain in the area, or if they develop a ''fever''.'  "
What happens to the thyroid tissue obtained at the fine needle aspiration biopsy?,"""After the procedure, the tissue obtained is prepared onto glass slides and sent to the pathologist for evaluation. First, the pathologist determines whether or not enough thyroid tissue has been obtained for analysis. (When there is an insufficient amount, a repeat fine needle aspiration biopsy is necessary.) After analysis, the tissue is classified. Although the classifications used by pathologists vary, the tissue is usually reported as (1) benign; (2) malignant; (3) suspicious; or (4) indeterminate. The chance of a false negative test (a test report that is negative when cancer is actually present) varies from 0-5%, depending on where the test is performed. The chance of a false positive (a test report showing cancer when there is no cancer present) is less than 5% and is usually due to the presence of degenerating cells or atypical cells. These results are reported back to the doctor's office, usually within one week. At this point, the doctor discusses the implications of the report and outlines further treatment, if needed based on the results.""  "
Summary,"""A fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid gland is an effective method to determine whether or not a thyroid nodule is cancer. The procedure is  relatively simple procedure that is usually performed in a doctor's office and usually takes less than 20 minutes. Complications are rare but include bleeding, bruising, and infection. Results are generally available within one week and help determine what further interventions or treatments are needed."" "
What are thyroid nodules?,"'The term ""thyroid nodule"" refers to any abnormal growth that forms a lump in the thyroid gland.'""The thyroid gland is located low in the front of the neck, below the Adam's apple. The gland is shaped like a butterfly and wraps around the windpipe or trachea. The two wings or lobes on either side of the windpipe are joined together by a ""'bridge'' of tissue, called the isthmus, which crosses over the front of the windpipe.''A thyroid nodule can occur in any part of the gland. Some nodules can be felt quite easily. Others can be hidden deep in the thyroid tissue or located very low in the gland, where they are difficult to feel.' "
What is a goiter?,"'A goiter is simply an enlarged thyroid gland. Multiple conditions can lead to goiter, including ''hypothyroidism'', ''hyperthyroidism'', excessive ''iodine'' intake, or thyroid tumors. Goiter is a non-specific finding that warrants medical evaluation.'  "
What are the symptoms and signs of thyroid nodules?,"'The vast majority of thyroid nodules do not cause symptoms. However, if the cells in the nodules are functioning and producing thyroid hormone on their own, the nodule may produce signs and symptoms of too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism). A small number of patients complain of ''pain'' at the site of the nodule that can travel to the ear or jaw. If the nodule is very large, it can cause ''difficulty swallowing'' or shortness of breath by compressing the esophagus (tube connecting the mouth to the stomach) or trachea (windpipe). In rare instances, a patient may complain of ''hoarseness'' or difficulty speaking because of compression of the larynx (voice box).'  "
What causes thyroid nodules? What are the different types?,"'Thyroid nodules may be single or multiple.''The cause of most thyroid nodules is unknown. In certain cases, insufficient iodine in the ''diet'' can cause the thyroid to develop nodules, but this is no longer common in the U.S. Certain genes may contribute to development of thyroid nodules.'   A thyroid gland that contains multiple nodules is referred to as a multinodular goiter. If the nodule is filled with fluid or blood, it is called a thyroid cyst. If the nodule produces thyroid hormone in an uncontrolled manner (without regarding the body's needs), the nodule is referred to as autonomous. Such a nodule may cause signs and symptoms of too much thyroid hormone, or hyperthyroidism. Less often, patients with a thyroid nodule may have too little thyroid hormone, or hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism is most common in the context of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, a condition characterized by painless autoimmune destruction of the thyroid. The most common types of single thyroid nodules are noncancerous colloid nodules or follicular adenomas. Another type of benign nodule that may be seen is called a Hurthle cell adenoma. Up to 24% of Hurthle cell nodules are cancerous. Few nodules are cancerous. Cancerous nodules are classified by the types of malignant thyroid cells they contain. These cell types include papillary, follicular, medullary, or poorly differentiated (anaplastic) cells. The prognosis for the patient depends largely on the cell type and how far the cancer has spread at the time of diagnosis. In addition to thyroid cancer of the cell types mentioned previously, thyroid nodules may contain lymphoma (a cancer of the cells of the immune system). Cancer from other sites, such as breast and kidney, can also spread (metastasize) to the thyroid."
Can thyroid nodules be cancer?,"'Modern imaging techniques - such as ''ultrasound'' (US), ''computerized tomography'' (CT), and ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') - have revealed more thyroid nodules incidentally This means that nodules are being found during studies that were done for reasons other than examination of the thyroid per se. Up to 4% to 8% of adult women and 1% to 2% of adult men have thyroid nodules detectable by physical examination. Closer to 30% of adult women have nodules detectable by ultrasound. In fact, diagnosis of a thyroid nodule is the most common endocrine problem in the United States.''Although the majority of thyroid nodules are benign (not cancerous), about 10% of nodules do contain cancer. Therefore, the primary purpose for evaluating a thyroid nodule is to determine whether cancer is present.' "
What tests diagnose thyroid nodules?,"'Thyroid nodules usually are discovered by the health care professional during routine physical examination of the neck. Occasionally, a patient may notice a nodule as a small lump in their neck when looking in the mirror. Once a nodule is discovered, a physician will carefully evaluate the nodule.''History:'' The doctor will take a detailed history, evaluating both past and present medical problems. If the patient is younger than 20 or older than 70 years, there is increased likelihood that a nodule is cancerous. Similarly, the nodule is more likely to be cancerous if there is any history of radiation exposure, difficulty swallowing, or a change in the voice. It was actually customary to apply radiation to the head and neck in the 1950s to treat ''acne''! Significant radiation exposures include the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters. Although women tend to have more thyroid nodules than men, the nodules found in men are more likely to be cancerous. Despite its value, the history cannot differentiate benign from malignant nodules. Thus, many patients with risk factors uncovered in the history will have benign lesions. Others without risk factors for malignant nodules may still have thyroid cancer.''Physical examination:'' The physician should determine if there is one nodule or many nodules, and what the remainder of the gland feels like. The probability of cancer is higher if the nodule is fixed to the surrounding tissue (unmovable). In addition, the physical exam should search for any abnormal ''lymph nodes'' nearby that may suggest the spread of cancer. In addition to evaluating the thyroid, the physician should identify any signs of gland malfunction, such as thyroid hormone overproduction (hyperthyroidism) or underproduction (hypothyroidism).''Blood tests:'' Initially, blood tests should be done to assess thyroid function. These tests include:''Ultrasonography:'' A physician may order an ultrasound examination of the thyroid to:''Despite its value, the ultrasound cannot determine whether a nodule is benign or cancerous.''Radionuclide scanning:'' Radionuclide scanning with radioactive chemicals is another imaging technique a physician may use to evaluate a thyroid nodule. The normal thyroid gland accumulates iodine from the blood and uses it to make thyroid hormones. Thus, when radioactive iodine (123-iodine) is administered orally or intravenously to an individual, it accumulates in the thyroid and causes the gland to ""light up"" when imaged by a nuclear camera (a type of Geiger counter). The rate of accumulation gives an indication of how the thyroid gland and any nodules are functioning. A ""hot spot"" appears if a part of the gland or a nodule is producing too much hormone. Non-functioning or hypo-functioning nodules appear as ""''cold'' spots"" on scanning. A cold or non-functioning nodule carries a higher risk of cancer than a normal or hyper-functioning nodule. Cancerous nodules are more likely to be cold, because cancer cells are immature and don\'t accumulate the iodine as well as normal thyroid tissue. However, cold spots can also be caused by ''cysts''. This makes the ultrasound a much better tool for determining the need to do an FNA.''Fine needle aspiration:'' Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a nodule is a type of biopsy and the most common, direct way to determine what types of cells are present. The needle used is very thin. The procedure is simple and can be done in an outpatient office, and anesthetic is injected into tissues traversed by the needle. FNA is possible if the nodule is easily felt. If the nodule is more difficult to feel, fine needle aspiration can be performed with ultrasound guidance. The needle is inserted into the thyroid or nodule to withdraw cells. Usually, several samples are taken to maximize the chance of detecting abnormal cells. These cells are examined microscopically by a pathologist to determine if cancer cells are present. The value of FNA depends upon the experience of the physician performing the FNA and the pathologist reading the specimen. Diagnoses that can be made from FNA include:''One of the most difficult problems for the pathologist is to be confident that a follicular adenoma - usually a benign nodule - is not a follicular cell ''carcinoma'"" or cancer. In these cases, it is up to the physician and the patient to weigh the option of surgery on a case-by-case basis, with less reliance on the pathologist's interpretation of the biopsy. It is also important to remember that there is a small risk (3%) that a benign nodule diagnosed by FNA may still be cancerous. Thus, even benign nodules should be followed closely by the patient and physician. Another biopsy may be necessary, especially if the nodule is growing. Most thyroid cancers are not very aggressive; that is, they do not spread rapidly. The exception is poorly differentiated (anaplastic) carcinoma, which spreads rapidly and is difficult to treat.""   The free T4 and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Elevated levels of the thyroid hormones T4 or T3 in the context of suppressed TSH suggests hyperthyroidism Reduced T4 or T3 in the context of high TSH suggests hypothyroidism Antibody titers to thyroperoxidase or thyroglobulin may be useful to diagnose autoimmune thyroiditis (for example, Hashimoto's thyroiditis). If surgery is likely to be considered for treatment, it is strongly recommended that the physician als determine the level of thyroglobin. Produced only in the thyroid hormone in the blood. Thyroglobulin carries thyroid hormone in the blood. Thyroglobulin levels should fall quickly within 48 hours in the thyroid gland is completely remobed. If thyroglobulin levels start to climb. Detect nodules that are not easily felt Determine the number of nodules and their sizes Determine if a nodule is solid or cystic Assist obtaining tissue for diagnosis from the thyroid with a fine needle aspirate (FNA) Benign thyroid tissue (non-cancerous) can be consistent with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, a colloid nodule, or a thyroid cyst. This result is reported from approximately 60% of biopsies. Cancerous tissue (malignant) can be consistent with diagnosis of papillary, follicular, or medullary cancer. This result is reported from approximately 5% of biopsies. The majority of these are papillary cancers. Suspicious biopsy can show a follicular adenoma. Though usually benign, up to 20% of these nodules are found ultimately to be cancerous. Non-diagnostic results usually arise because insufficient cells were obtained. Upon repeat biopsy, up to 50% of these cases can be distinguished as benign, cancerous, or suspicious."
What is the treatment for thyroid nodules?,"'Follicular adenomas are difficult to distinguish from follicular cancers. Follicular nodules, other nodules highly suspicious for cancer and definite cancer should be treated by surgery. Most thyroid cancers are curable and rarely cause life-threatening problems. Any nodule not removed needs to be watched closely by follow-up with the physician every 6 to 12 months. This follow-up may involve a physical examination, ultrasound examination, or both. Occasionally, a physician may attempt to shrink the nodule by using suppressive doses of thyroid hormone. Some physicians believe that if a nodule shrinks on suppressive therapy, it is more likely to be benign. Recent large studies have shown that treating with thyroid suppression does not make a difference.''If a nodule causes hyperthyroidism, it is usually noncancerous. Treatment is aimed at preventing the signs, symptoms, and complications of hyperthyroidism, such as ''heart failure'', ''osteoporosis'',, and rapid ''heart'' rate. Treatments include destroying the gland using radioactive iodine (131-iodine), blocking production of thyroid hormone with medications, or conservatively following the patient with mild hyperthyroidism. ""Subclinical hyperthyroidism"" refers to an adult patient with a hyperfunctioning nodule, but TSH is minimally suppressed and the blood levels of thyroid hormones are normal. Treatment is individualized based on age, presence of other medical conditions, and patient preference.'  "
What is thyroid peroxidase?,"'Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is an enzyme made in the thyroid gland that is important in the production of ''thyroid hormone''.

What is the thyroid gland?,"'The thyroid is a gland that makes and stores essential hormones that help regulate the ''heart'' rate, ''blood pressure'', body temperature, and the rate of chemical reactions (metabolism) in the body. It is located in the anterior neck just below the ""Adam\'s apple.""''The thyroid gland is the main part of the body that takes up ''iodine''. In a thyroid scan, iodine is labeled with a radioactive tracer, and a special camera is used to measure how much tracer is absorbed from the bloodstream by the thyroid gland. If a patient is ''allergic'' to iodine, technetium can be used as an alternative.' "
How is the thyroid scan performed?,"'A thyroid scan is an outpatient procedure usually done in the nuclear medicine section of a hospital. This is usually part of the radiology department.''If you have a thyroid scan, you will be asked to take a drink, or swallow a pill containing the iodine. You will then wait for the iodine to be taken up by the thyroid - usually about 4 hours. At this time you lie under a scintography camera, and it will take pictures which correlate directly to the amount of iodine taken up by the thyroid. This is done by counting the intensity and location of the gamma rays emitted by the radioactively labeled iodine. You then leave the hospital, and return in 24 hours to have a second scan performed in the same manner.''There are no limitations during this 24 hour interval except that you will be asked to take precautions when you urinate. This is because the radioactive iodine is removed from your body by the urine, and it is safer to have others avoid contact with your urine during this time. Be sure to let the doctor performing the test know if you have an iodine ''allergy'', or if you have ingested a lot of iodine-containing foods (like sushi) prior to the test.' "
When is thyroid scanning helpful?,"'A thyroid scan can provide information on the size and shape of the gland as well as the overall activity of the gland (is the whole thyroid gland overactive or underactive?). ''For example, thyroid scanning is used to determine how active thyroid tissue is in manufacturing ''thyroid hormone''. This feature can determine whether inflammation of the thyroid gland (''thyroiditis'') is present. It can also detect the presence and degree of overactivity of the gland (''hyperthyroidism'' ). In this case the scan reveals increased iodine uptake by the whole gland. ''In addition, a thyroid scan can provide information on specific areas within the thyroid gland and can help to determine whether any localized areas are hyperfunctioning or under functioning compared to the rest of the gland. In these cases spots appear on the image corresponding to areas that take up iodine differently from the rest of the gland. ''Thyroid scanning is especially helpful in evaluating ''thyroid nodules'', particularly after a fine needle aspiration biopsy has failed to provide a diagnosis. A scan will reveal whether a ''thyroid nodule'' is ""functioning"" or ""nonfunctioning"". Doctors refer to hyper functioning nodules of the thyroid (those that are actively taking up iodine to produce thyroid hormone more so than surrounding thyroid tissue) as ""hot"" nodules, and these hyperfunctioning areas are seen on the image of the thyroid gland. A nonfunctioning nodule does not take up iodine and produces a localized ""''cold''"" area on the image of the thyroid gland. ''In addition, thyroid scanning can be done to help determine if ''thyroid cancer'' has spread beyond the bed of the thyroid in the neck. For this purpose, usually a whole body thyroid scan is performed. ' "
"What is significant about whether a nodule is ""hot"" or ""cold?""","'Functioning or ""hot"" nodules only rarely are from ''cancer''. Nearly all thyroid ''cancers'' are nonfunctioning or ""cold"" nodules. However, even among ""cold"" nodules, ''cancer'' is infrequent (less than 5 percent of cases).' "
Thyroid Scan Safety and Efficacy,"'While the thought of taking something ""radioactive"" is not very appealing, it is important to remember that iodine concentrates only in thyroid tissue, making this test safe and also quite specific for ''thyroid disorders''.''A thyroid scan can provide information on both the structure as well as the function of the thyroid gland. This information can help you and your physician determine if further investigations, procedures, or medications are medically necessary.' "
What is the thyroid gland? What are thyroid diseases?,"'The thyroid gland makes and stores hormones that help regulate the ''heart'' rate, ''blood pressure'', body temperature, and the rate at which food is converted into energy. Thyroid hormones are essential for the function of every cell in the body. They help regulate growth and the rate of chemical reactions (metabolism) in the body. Thyroid hormones also help children grow and develop.''Types of thyroid problems include;''hyperthyroidism'' (overactive thyroid) that can cause;\xa0'  Graves' disease, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), Hashimoto's thyroiditis, goiters, nodules, and cancer."
What are thyroid hormones? What do they do?,"'The thyroid uses ''iodine'', a mineral found in some foods and in iodized salt, to make its hormones. The two most important thyroid hormones are thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the ''pituitary gland'', acts to stimulate hormone production by the thyroid gland.''The thyroid gland also makes the hormone ''calcitonin'', which is involved in calcium metabolism and stimulating bone cells to add calcium to bone.''The thyroid gland is controlled by the ''pituitary gland'' and hypothalamus. Diseases and conditions effect thyroid function, which causes thyroid problems.' "
How are thyroid problems diagnosed?,"'A doctor or other healthcare professional will take your medical history and give you a physical exam. Specialized tests are used to diagnose ''thyroid disorders''. Blood tests may be used help diagnose thyroid problems. Usually, imaging tests like ''ultrasound'', radioactive thyroid scans, and fine needle aspiration and biopsy of the thyroid gland are techniques ordered to measure levels of thyroid hormones and TSH in the blood.' "
What natural home remedies and supplements treat thyroid problems?,"'Supplements'' that contain large amounts of ''iodine'' such as seaweed can make ''thyroid hormone'"" levels go very high or very low if you have nodular goiter and a history of an autoimmune thyroid condition such as Hashimoto's ""'thyroiditis'"" or Graves' disease.""'There is no scientific evidence that herbal ''supplements'', ''yoga'' poses, natural thyroid treatments, or natural thyroid remedies improve thyroid health and function. ''Dietary supplements'' are not regulated by any agency and therefore there is no quality control of these ''supplements''. It is not recommended that any supplement be taken for thyroid health.'""Don't take ""'supplements'' for your thyroid problem without consulting a doctor.'  "

What is a transient ischemic attack (TIA)?,"'The primary role of the brain is to send signals to the body for motor function and respond to receive signals received through the five senses (sight, ''hearing'', touch, smell, and taste). The brain processes information both through conscious thought, and unconsciously through the nervous systems that control basic bodily functions, like heart rate, ''breathing'', and temperature control.''When a portion of the brain loses its blood supply, it can become damaged and stop functioning. When a portion of the brain does not function, the part of the body that it controls also stops working. This is called a stroke or a ''cerebrovascular accident'' (CVA). If the brain is able to regain its blood supply quickly, then the CVA symptoms may resolve; this is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA is a stroke that resolves by itself. ' The brain is arranged so that the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body, and the left side of the brain controls the right of the body. Vision is located in the back of the brain (occiput), and balance and coordination are located at the bottom of the brain (cerebellum). Blood supply to the brain comes from the two carotid arteries that are located in the front of the neck, and the 
two vertebral arteries that run in the back of the neck through small canals in the bony spine (vertebrae).  All four arteries connect at a junction of blood vessels located in the base of the brain (called the Circle of Willis), and from there smaller arteries 
branch out to supply the brain with oxygen and nutrients."
"What are the 
causes of transient ischemic attack (TIA)?","'Loss of blood supply to portions of the brain may occur for a variety of reasons. A blood vessel can become blocked, and blood supply to a part of the brain is lost, or a blood vessel can leak blood into the brain (''brain hemorrhage''). Most commonly however, the blood vessel is blocked. The blockage can be caused by a ''blood clot'' that forms in the blood vessel (thrombosis) or it can be caused by a clot or debris that floats downstream (embolus).''Fatty plaque formation in the blood vessel wall is called atherosclerosis or ""hardening of the arteries."" Plaque can rupture and cause a small ''blood clot'' to form and occlude the blood vessel. Blockage can also occur when debris from narrowing of a carotid artery breaks off, and floats downstream to cause the occlusion. Sometimes, in people with an irregular heart beat called ''atrial fibrillation'', small blood clots can be formed within the heart and travel to the brain to cause the obstruction.''Brain hemorrhage or bleeding in the brain can be due to an ''aneurysm'', a weak spot in a blood vessel that ruptures and spills blood into the brain tissue, or it may be due to spontaneous bleeding caused by poorly controlled ''hypertension'' (''high blood pressure''). Such bleeding more commonly results in the irreversible damage of a stroke, and would not necessarily resolve to be classified as a TIA.'  "
What are the risk factors for transient ischemic attack (TIA)?,"'The risk factors for TIA or stroke are the same as those for other ''vascular disease'', similar to heart attack (''coronary artery disease'') or ''peripheral vascular disease'', which causes decreased blood flow to the legs. These risk factors include:''Moreover, any condition that results in stagnant blood flow and or clotting may result in a TIA due to embolization of a blood clot. Such conditions may include ''atrial fibrillation'', large ''heart attacks'', and severe ''weakness'' of the heart muscle (''cardiomyopathy'') .' family history smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes."
"What are the 
symptoms of transient ischemic attack (TIA)?","'The intensity and location of the blood limitation to the brain will determine what symptoms will occur as a result of a stroke or TIA. Many people experience ''confusion'', weakness, and lethargy. If the loss of blood supply is in an area supplied by the middle cerebral artery, a classic sign may include weakness or ''paralysis'' and numbness of one side of the body. The whole side may be affected, or just one limb. Often there is a facial droop. If the stroke is on the left side of the body where the speech centers are usually located, there may be difficulty understanding words or speaking. Partial ''vision loss'' may also be part of the constellation of symptoms.''Strokes'' involving the vertebral arteries decrease blood supply to the base of the brain and may cause a drop attack (a sudden fall while ''walking'' or standing, and then a quick recovery), an unexpected collapse, incoordination, or difficulty walking.''The important distinction between stroke and TIA is resolution of the symptoms. By definition, the symptoms of a TIA must completely resolve. And, while this most often occurs within the first few minutes after symptom onset, it may take up to 24 hours to have complete return to normal function.''A special type of TIA is amaurosis fugax. Transient ''blindness'' in one eye occurs because debris from a narrowed carotid artery clogs the artery (ophthalmic artery) that supplies blood to the retina of the eye.'  "
How is transient ischemic attack (TIA) diagnosed?,"'TIA is diagnosed by history and physical examination. Since most often the symptoms have resolved, the physician will need to complete a thorough history from the patient and family or friends who witnessed the event. The physical exam will include careful attention to the neurologic examination. This may include:''If the diagnosis of TIA is made, further urgent testing is usually recommended, including: '  Assess mental status to make certain the patient is alert and oriented. Check eye range of motion and facial movement to evaluate the cranial nerves (the short nerves that run from the brain to the face and neck). Listen to the neck with a stethoscope to detect abnormal sounds that may signal narrowing of the blood vessel (carotid bruits). Check for a regular heart rhythm to rule out the presence of atrial fibrillation. Examine the arms and legs for tone, power, and sensation. Check coordination and balance. Electrocardiogram (EKG) to confirm a regular heart rate Computerized tomography (CT scan) of the brain to assess bleeding Carotid ultrasound to assess for narrowing of the large blood vessels in the neck Some hospitals have CT angiogram available to evaluate the cerebral, carotid, and vertebral arteries. This test is the same as a CT of the head with the addition of intravenous dye into the blood vessels to the arteries. Routine blood tests may include a complete blood count (CBC) to assess for anemia 
(low red blood cell count) or too few platelets (thrombocytopenia). If the patient takes warfarin (Coumadin), a blood thinner, then an international normalized ratio (INR - a blood test that measures the degree of blood thinning) or prothrombin time (PT), may be performed to assess blood clotting measurements. If there is concern that the heart is the source of blood clot or debris, then an echocardiogram or sound wave tracing of the heart may be considered."
What is the treatment for a transient ischemic attack (TIA)?,"'Treatment for a transient ischemic attack is aimed at preventing a second stroke. Since there is no way of determining the severity of future episodes, and no guarantee that the symptoms will resolve, ''prevention'' of a future TIA or CVA is crucial. ''Treatment guidelines address a variety of targeted goals. ''Smoking'', excessive ''alcohol'', ''obesity'' and lack of physical activity are considered risks for future stroke. The following recommendations are now suggested: '  If the patient was not taking 
aspirin when the TIA occurred, it usually is started at a dose of 325 mg per day. If the patient was taking aspirin, another antiplatelet drug called dipyridamole may be added. Aggrenox is a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole. Headache is often a side effect. If the patient cannot tolerate aspirin because of allergy or stomach upset clopidogrel (Plavix) may be used.  Even if the patient does not have hypertension or high blood pressure, there may be benefit in taking anti-hypertensive medications. Two classes of drugs are recommended to be started at the same time, a diuretic and an 
ACE inhibitor. The goal for normal blood pressure is 120/80.  Guidelines recommend that a statin drug be started, even if cholesterol levels are normal. Simvastatin (Zocor) is the most commonly recommended medication, but new guidelines limit the amount prescribed per day because of the risk of liver side effects. Smoking: Counseling, smoking cessation aids like 
nicotine gum or medications like
varenicline (Chantix) should be considered. Environmental smoke should be avoided. Alcohol: Intake should be limited to two or fewer drinks a day for men and one or less for women. Obesity: Overweight people should try to lose weight using a combination of diet, exercise and counseling. The goal is a BMI of 18.5-24.9 and a waist line of 35 inches or less for women and 40 inches or less for men.  Exercise: 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily is recommended for those who are able. For 
people with disabilities, a tailored exercise program to their capabilities should be arranged. "
What is the prognosis for transient ischemic attack (TIA)?,"'A transient ischemic attack should be considered a major warning sign of an impending future stroke. Up to 15% of people will experience a stroke within three months of TIA. Since there is no way of predicting that stroke-like symptoms will resolve, the patient and family need to be educated should symptoms occur, they need to access medical care emergently'' activating the emergency medical services system and calling 911.''If a stroke occurs, there is a very short period of time where the thrombolytic (clot busting drugs like ''alteplase'' [TPA]), can be used to reverse a stroke. In most hospitals, the drug can only be given within 4 1/2 hours of onset of ''stroke symptoms''. In that time frame, the patient needs to get to the hospital, the diagnosis needs to be made, laboratory tests and head ''CT scans'"" need to be performed, neurologic consultation needs to occur, and the drug administered. The longer the delay, greater the risk that the drug won't work and that complications such as bleeding into the brain will occur.""'Specialized interventional radiologists can inject TPA directly into the clot that has blocked the blood vessel in the brain. This can extend the time frame to six hours or longer, but currently this treatment is not widely available.''TIAs should be considered the equivalent of ''angina'' of the brain. In ''heart disease'', angina is the heart ''pain'' that warns of potential heart attack. When heart muscle is damaged, it cannot be replaced or repaired. Similarly, brain tissue is at risk when there is decreased blood supply and it, too, cannot be replaced.'  "
Introduction to trigeminal neuralgia (TN),"'The brain is connected to the body by the spinal cord with spinal nerves sending and receiving impulses and messages to and from the brain. However, there are twelve cranial nerves that directly connect to the body. These nerves are involved with the muscle and sensory function of the head and neck. (The exception is cranial nerve X or the vagus nerve, which is also responsible for the parasympathetic system of the chest and abdomen).''The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) is so named because it has three (tri) branches responsible for face sensation; one branch also regulates chewing.' The ophthalmic branch (V1) is responsible for sensation from the scalp, forehead, upper eyelid and tip of the nose. The maxillary branch (V2) sensation covers the lower eyelid, the side of the nose, the upper lip and cheek, and the upper teeth and gums. The mandibular branch (V3) is responsible for sensation of the lower teeth and gums, lower lip, chin, jaw, and part of the ear. It is also responsible for supplying the muscles involved with chewing (mastication), those muscles involved with chewing."
What is trigeminal neuralgia (TN)?,"'Trigeminal neuralgia is inflammation of the trigeminal nerve, causing intense facial ''pain''. It is also known as tic douloureax because the intense ''pain'' can cause patients to contort their face into a grimace and cause the head to move away from the pain. The obvious movement is known as a tic.''The pain of trigeminal neuralgia is intense and may be an isolated episode or may be occur every few hours, minutes, or seconds. There can be months or years between attacks, but in some patients whose pain is not well controlled; it can lead to a ''chronic pain'' syndrome, affecting activities of daily life and cause ''depression''.''Though it can affect people of any age, trigeminal neuralgia tends to afflict people older than 60 years of age. It affects the right side of the face five times more often than the left.'  "
What causes trigeminal neuralgia?,"'Most often, the cause of trigeminal neuralgia is idiopathic, meaning the cause is not known. There are some instances when the nerve can be compressed by nearby blood vessels, aneurysms, or tumors.''There are inflammatory causes of trigeminal neuralgia because of systemic diseases including ''multiple sclerosis'', ''sarcoidosis'', and ''Lyme disease''. There also is an association with collagen vascular diseases including ''scleroderma'' and ''systemic lupus erythematosus''.'  "
What are the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia?,"'Symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia include an acute onset of sharp, stabbing pain to one side of the face. It tends to begin at the angle of the jaw and radiate along the junction lines; between the ophthalmic branchV''1'' and maxillary branch V''2,'' or the maxillary branch V''2'' and the mandibular branch V''3''.''The pain is severe and described as an electric ''shock''. It may be made worse by light touch, chewing, or ''cold'' exposure in the mouth. In the midst of an attack, affected individuals shield their face trying to protect it from being touched. This is an important diagnostic sign because with many other pain syndromes like a  ''toothache'', the person will rub or hold the face to ease the pain.''While there may be only one attack of pain, the person may experience recurrent sharp pain every few hours or every few seconds. Between the attacks, the pain resolves completely and the the person has no symptoms. However, because of fear that the intense pain might return, people can be quite distraught. Trigeminal neuralgia tends not to occur when the person is asleep, and this differentiates it from ''migraines'', which often waken the person.''After the first episode of attacks, the pain may subside for months or years but there is always the risk that trigeminal neuralgia will recur without warning.'  "
How is trigeminal neuralgia diagnosed?,"'Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia is a clinical diagnosis and often no testing is required after the health care professional takes a history of the situation and performs a physical examination which should be normal.''It is important to remember that the neurologic exam must be normal. There are two specific areas to test. There can be no muscle ''weakness''; V''3'' is responsible for chewing and there can be no jaw or facial weakness found. The corneal reflex controlled by V''1'' must be present. When the ''cornea'' or covering of the eye is touched, the eye blinks in response. If these two findings are not normal, the search should begin for an inflammatory or compression cause of the trigeminal nerve. Some clinicians may order an ''MRI'' to help diagnose other conditions that may cause trigeminal neuralgia.''The International ''Headache'' Society has established criteria for making the diagnosis and includes the following:' Paroxysmal attacks of pain lasting from a fraction of a second to 2 
minutes, affecting 1 or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve and fulfilling 
criteria B and C. Pain has at least one of the following characteristics: (1) 
intense, sharp, superficial or stabbing; or (2) precipitated from trigger areas 
or by trigger factors  Attacks stereotyped in the individual patient  No 
clinically evident neurologic deficit  Not attributed to another disorder"
What is the treatment for trigeminal neuralgia?,"   Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia most often is treated with good success using 
a single anticonvulsant medication such as 
	carbamazepine (Tegretol). 
	 
Gabapentin 
	(Neurontin, Gabarone), 
	baclofen and 
	phenytoin 
	(Dilantin, Dilantin-125) may be used as second line drugs, often in 
addition to carbamazepine. In many patients, as time progresses, carbamazepine 
becomes less effective and these drugs can be used in combination to control the 
pain. Should pain persist and medication fail to be effective, surgery or radiation 
therapy may be other treatment options. 
Lamotrigine (Lamictal) may be prescribed for multiple sclerosis patients who 
develop trigeminal neuralgia."
What are ticks? What do ticks look like?,"'Ticks are small arachnids. Ticks require blood meals to complete their complex life cycles. Ticks are scientifically classified as ''Arachnida'' (a classification that includes spiders). The fossil record suggests ticks have been around at least 90 million years. There are over 800 species of ticks throughout the world, but only two families of ticks, ''Ixodidae'' (hard ticks) and ''Argasidae'' (soft ticks), are known to transmit diseases or illness to humans. Hard ticks have a scutum, or hard plate, on their back while soft ticks do not. Tickborne diseases occur worldwide.''Ticks have a complex life cycle that includes eggs, larvae, nymphs, and adult male and female ticks. The larvae, nymphs (also termed seed ticks), and adults all need blood meals. Usually, the female adult (hard tick) is the one causing the most bites as males usually die after mating. Ticks do not jump, fly, or drop. They simply reach out with their legs and grab or crawl onto a host. Although some larvae have preferred hosts, most ticks in the nymph or adult phase will attach a get a blood meal from several different kinds of animals, including humans. Except for a few species of larval ticks, the immature phases (larvae, nymphs) usually are even less selective about where they get a blood meal and are known to bite snakes, amphibians, birds, and mammals. Larvae are very small (about 1/32 of an inch with six legs), while nymphs are about 1/16-1/8 inch with eight legs and adults about 3/16-1/4 inch with eight legs. The complex life cycles are described in the last web citation below, and all of the web citations include pictures of various tick species. Although ticks will die eventually if they do not get a blood meal, many species can survive a year or more without a blood meal. The hard ticks tend to attach and feed for hours to days. Disease transmission usually occurs near the end of a meal, as the tick becomes full of blood. It may take hours before a hard tick transmits pathogens. Soft ticks usually feed for less than one hour. Disease transmission can occur in less than a minute with soft ticks. The bite of some of these soft ticks produces intensely painful reactions.''Ticks are transmitters (vectors) of diseases for humans and animals. Ticks can transmit disease to many hosts; some cause economic harm such as Texas ''fever'"" (bovine babesiosis) in cattle that can kill up to 90% of yearling cows. Ticks act as vectors when microbes in their saliva and mouth secretions get into the host's skin and blood. Ticks were understood to be vectors of disease in the mid-1800s, and as investigative methods improved (microscopes, culture techniques, tissue staining), more information showed the wide variety of diseases that could be transmitted by ticks.""'There are many common names for various ticks (for example, dog tick, deer tick, and African tick), and these names appear in the scientific literature, too. Most common names represent a genus of ticks. However, the common name ""red"" may be used by people to describe almost any tick that has had a blood meal (engorge with blood).' "
What are the risk factors for tick bites?,"'People who go through grassy areas and woods are at higher risk for tick bites, especially during the months from April through September. People who travel through such areas out of necessity or for recreation are at higher risk than those that protect themselves with appropriate clothing like long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and DEET-containing repellents (see ''prevention'' section below). In addition, people who have pets treated with flea and tick repellents decrease their risk of tick bites. People who live in areas surrounded by tall grassy areas or woods have a higher risk for tick bites, but the prevention section below describes ways to reduce risks.' "
What specialists treat tick bites?,"'Although most tick bites need no special treatment, occasionally such specialists in infectious disease, internal medicine, allergists, and/or individuals who have special training in treating such diseases as ''Lyme disease'' may be consulted.' "
What are tick bite symptoms and signs?,"'Unfortunately for the purpose of detection, the tick bite is usually painless and remains that way even after the tick stops the blood meal and falls off of the skin. Later, the bite site may develop''A few individuals may be sensitive or ''allergic'' to tick bites (tick saliva secretions) and develop''However, the majority of individuals with tick bites develop no symptoms, and many people do not remember getting bitten.''Some immediate symptoms that infrequently or rarely develop during or immediately after a tick bite initially may be ''flu-like'' and include''Individuals with these symptoms should be seen immediately by a doctor.''Recently, researchers have found that the tick bite (mainly the saliva produced by the lone star tick) has caused thousands of people to become allergic to red meat, termed a meat ''allergy'' (beef, pork, venison, and occasionally, milk). People can eat poultry (chicken, turkey) and have no allergic reactions. When they eat red meat, they develop swelling and ''hives''. Some may develop ''anaphylaxis'"". The reaction is thought to be due to an alpha-gal antigen in the tick's gut and/or saliva that stimulates an immune response that results in an ""'allergic reaction'' when red meat is consumed.

What diseases do ticks transmit (act as vectors) to humans?,"'This list shows that some ticks (for example, ''Ixodes'') can transmit more than one type of pathogenic microbe (virus, bacteria, and protozoa). It is possible to transmit more than one pathogen in a single tick bite, although this rarely occurs. Outbreaks of tick-related illnesses follow seasonal patterns (about April to September in the U.S.) as ticks evolve from larvae to adults.'

This rare virus is likely tick vector-borne (tick species vector unknown but possibly lone star tick). A Missouri state park employee died from the infection in 2017."
What are the symptoms and signs of diseases transmitted by ticks?,"'There is a wide range of symptoms that usually develop days to weeks after the tick bite. The symptoms that become manifest depend on the particular microbe (pathogen) that is transmitted. For example, ''erythema migrans'' (a rash that is occasionally resembles a ""bull\'s eye"") is often the first sign of ''Lyme disease'' transmitted by a tick bite. Other symptoms may seem ''flu''-like and can include weakness, ''nausea'', fever, ''vomiting'', ''palpitations'', rash, ''joint pain'', swelling, numbness, and confusion. This is not an all-inclusive list, and other symptoms and signs can develop depending on the pathogen transmitted by the tick bite. More than one disease may be transmitted with tick bites; for example; some individuals may be infected with ''Lyme disease'' and babesiosis at the same time.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose a tick bite?,"""No tests exist that either identify tick bites or the type of tick once the tick dislodges from the host's body. However, doctors can examine the entire body, looking for ticks still attached, ""'rashes'', or signs of a tick-caused disease. If a tick is identified, the physician can better choose what additional tests should be done because some ticks are likely to transmit certain pathogens. Again, the web citations below have photos of ticks that can help distinguish ticks from biting insects, such as fleas, mites, or ''bedbugs''.''Identification of the tick genus and species may help the physician determine what further tests may be scheduled. For example, blood tests for diseases such as Lyme disease, ''Rocky Mountain spotted fever'"", ehrlichiosis, and tularemia are generally not positive for weeks after the exposure, even though symptoms may be present. Knowledge of the type of tick that caused the bite can help narrow the physician's possible diagnoses and even allow the physician to proceed with early therapy before a positive diagnosis is made.""'Exams and tests should be done if an individual exhibits symptoms after a tick bite. Most tick bites do not have symptoms. If symptoms develop after a tick bite, the determination of which tests need to be performed can be optimized in consultation with an infectious-disease specialist.'  "
What is the treatment for a tick bite?,"'For all tick bites, local cleansing and antibiotic cream may be applied. If the bite area develops ''itching'', preparations containing ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') are recommended. These Benadryl compounds can be applied directly to the skin for itching or administered orally by tablets. This is usually the only treatment needed.''However, treatment of the pathogens that the tick may pass to a person depends on other factors, such as the type of tick, length of time of attachment to the host, diseases in the community, and symptoms developed by the patient. Specific treatment is based on the identity of the pathogen transmitted. For example, oral antibiotics may be prescribed for some patients with tick bites if they live in an area where Lyme disease is endemic. With more significant symptoms, antibiotics may need to be given intravenously and the patient may need to be hospitalized. The best approach to treatment is to diagnose which pathogen has been transmitted to the patient (for example, ''Borrelia'' species of bacteria) and then use the specific treatment recommended to reduce or kill the pathogen.'  "
What is the best method of tick removal?,"'The following is a step-by-step method that is suggested for safe and effective removal of all types of ticks.''To remove the tick without tweezers, there have been several suggestions that may or may not work. The following are two examples that individuals claim work well and cause the tick to release itself from the skin with all of its mouthparts intact:''These methods are mentioned because sometimes tweezers are not available; nonetheless, if these methods remove the tick along with its intact mouthparts, individuals should thoroughly wash their hands and disinfect any areas with which the tick may have come in contact.''Other ways to remove ticks, such as using a hot match head or painting the tick with nail polish, gasoline, or other materials, are not advised. Such treatments can cause the tick to release more fluids back into the bite and increases the chance to transmit disease before the tick releases itself from the skin.'   Wear hand protection such as gloves so you don't spread pathogens from the tick to your hands; use a fine-tipped forceps or tweezers to grab the tick at skin level. Grasp the tick firmly with the tweezers as close to the skin as possible without crushing the tick. Apply gentle pulling motion upward until the tick comes free. Twisting or turning the tick does not make removal easier because the mouthparts are barbed; in fact, such actions may break off the head and mouthparts, thereby increasing the chances for infection. The second web citation illustrates the proper removal of a tick. Once the tick is removed, don't crush the tick because it may release pathogens. Consider keeping it in a tightly closed jar or taped to a piece of paper. Show the tick to the doctor if the person bitten becomes ill after the tick bite. Flush any removed ticks not kept for identification down the toilet or sink. The area of the bite should leave a small crater or indentation where the head and mouthparts were embedded. If portions of the head or mouthparts remain, they may be removed by a doctor. Thoroughly cleanse the bite area with soap and water or a mild disinfectant. Observe the area for several days for development of a reaction to the bite (rash or signs of infection). Apply antibiotic cream to the area as a precaution. Application of an antibiotic to the area may help prevent a local infection but usually does not affect the chance of developing diseases transmitted by the tick. Wash hands thoroughly after handling any tick or instruments that touched a tick. Clean and disinfect any instruments that were used. Find the tick on the skin, and with your finger (preferably a gloved finger), rotate the body of the tick clockwise or counterclockwise for about a minute or so. This irritates the tick enough to cause it to let go of the skin and then the tick can be removed by simply touching the tick to scotch tape. Put liquid soap on a cotton ball and cover the tick with the soaked cotton ball for about 15 to 20 seconds; the tick will supposedly release itself from the skin and get caught up in the cotton ball. You can dispose of the tick by placing it and the cotton ball in a sealable plastic bag."
Is it possible to prevent tick bites?,"'Acaricides are chemicals that will kill ticks and mites (anti-tick medication). Acaricides have been used in high-use, confined areas where ticks might be prevalent, such as yards or deer blinds. Reductions of tick habitats (for example, removal of leaf litter, tall grasses, and brush) have been effective in small-scale trials. Newer methods of control include applying acaricides to animal hosts by using baited tubes, boxes, and feeding stations in areas where infected ticks are endemic (for example, some areas with dense deer populations). Biological control with fungi, parasitic nematodes, and parasitic wasps may also help reduce the tick population. Avoid tick season completely by staying away from outdoor areas where ticks thrive, usually during the months of April through September in the U.S. In addition, application of acaricides (chemicals that kill ticks and mites) can be applied to large areas of land to reduce the tick and ''mite'' population. Removing litter and brush from areas where people live and work may reduce exposure to ticks.''The third web citation below has the CDC recommended methods (tips) for outdoor workers (and others) to avoid getting tick bites (how to become relatively tick-safe) and is summarized here:''Consider wearing tick repellent clothing if you spend significant amount of time in potential tick areas. Be sure to treat pets with flea and tick repellents. If ticks are removed from pets, manage them the same way you would remove a tick on a person. Protect yourself from the potential exposures with gloves. People who live in a tick-infested area and have experienced a fever within the last two months should not donate blood.'   Avoid grassy areas and shrubs where ticks populations may be high and where they reside, waiting to grab a ride on a potential host. Wear light-colored clothing so ticks can be easily seen, and brush them off. Tuck pants into boots or socks to avoid ticks crawling up loose pant legs. Apply insect repellant and use the brands designed to repel ticks. Follow label instructions. Avoid use of DEET-containing repellents on children. Carefully follow instructions and apply some repellents directly to skin and others to clothing. DEET-containing repellents with concentrations of 15% or less may be suitable for children. These should be carefully applied strictly following label directions. Insect repellents containing permethrins may be applied to clothing but not to skin. In areas that have a high tick population, DEET-containing repellents may need to be reapplied more frequently than for repelling mosquitoes. Follow the package label instructions carefully. Promptly check yourself, others, and pets if exposed to areas where ticks are likely to be located."
What is the prognosis for people who get a tick bite?,"'The great majority of people who get tick bites have no problems during or after the bite. For people with suppressed immune systems (''HIV'', ''cancer'', ''chemotherapy'' patients), the prognosis is still good, but they should contact their physicians and inform them about a tick bite. Also, the faster the tick is removed after a bite, the less likely the tick will transmit pathogens.''The overall prognosis for an individual person changes if the tick transmits a pathogen. The prognosis can range from good to poor and is determined by the disease transmitted, the time to diagnosis, the stage of the disease, and the condition of the patient. Immune-suppressed patients usually have a worse prognosis than otherwise healthy people. Consultation with an infectious-disease specialist is one of the best ways to determine the prognosis for the many diseases that ticks can transmit to people.' "

Again, the web citations below have photos of ticks that can help distinguish ticks from biting insects, such as fleas, mites, or ''bedbugs''.''Identification of the tick genus and species may help the physician determine what further tests may be scheduled. For example, blood tests for diseases such as Lyme disease, ''Rocky Mountain spotted fever'"", ehrlichiosis, and tularemia are generally not positive for weeks after the exposure, even though symptoms may be present. Knowledge of the type of tick that caused the bite can help narrow the physician's possible diagnoses and even allow the physician to proceed with early therapy before a positive diagnosis is made.""'Exams and tests should be done if an individual exhibits symptoms after a tick bite. Most tick bites do not have symptoms. If symptoms develop after a tick bite, the determination of which tests need to be performed can be optimized in consultation with an infectious-disease specialist.'  "
What is the treatment for a tick bite?,"'For all tick bites, local cleansing and antibiotic cream may be applied. If the bite area develops ''itching'', preparations containing ''diphenhydramine'' (''Benadryl'') are recommended. These Benadryl compounds can be applied directly to the skin for itching or administered orally by tablets. This is usually the only treatment needed.''However, treatment of the pathogens that the tick may pass to a person depends on other factors, such as the type of tick, length of time of attachment to the host, diseases in the community, and symptoms developed by the patient. Specific treatment is based on the identity of the pathogen transmitted. For example, oral antibiotics may be prescribed for some patients with tick bites if they live in an area where Lyme disease is endemic. With more significant symptoms, antibiotics may need to be given intravenously and the patient may need to be hospitalized. The best approach to treatment is to diagnose which pathogen has been transmitted to the patient (for example, ''Borrelia'' species of bacteria) and then use the specific treatment recommended to reduce or kill the pathogen.'  "
What is the best method of tick removal?,"'The following is a step-by-step method that is suggested for safe and effective removal of all types of ticks.''To remove the tick without tweezers, there have been several suggestions that may or may not work. The following are two examples that individuals claim work well and cause the tick to release itself from the skin with all of its mouthparts intact:''These methods are mentioned because sometimes tweezers are not available; nonetheless, if these methods remove the tick along with its intact mouthparts, individuals should thoroughly wash their hands and disinfect any areas with which the tick may have come in contact.''Other ways to remove ticks, such as using a hot match head or painting the tick with nail polish, gasoline, or other materials, are not advised. Such treatments can cause the tick to release more fluids back into the bite and increases the chance to transmit disease before the tick releases itself from the skin.'   Wear hand protection such as gloves so you don't spread pathogens from the tick to your hands; use a fine-tipped forceps or tweezers to grab the tick at skin level. Grasp the tick firmly with the tweezers as close to the skin as possible without crushing the tick. Apply gentle pulling motion upward until the tick comes free. Twisting or turning the tick does not make removal easier because the mouthparts are barbed; in fact, such actions may break off the head and mouthparts, thereby increasing the chances for infection. The second web citation illustrates the proper removal of a tick. Once the tick is removed, don't crush the tick because it may release pathogens. Consider keeping it in a tightly closed jar or taped to a piece of paper. Show the tick to the doctor if the person bitten becomes ill after the tick bite. Flush any removed ticks not kept for identification down the toilet or sink. The area of the bite should leave a small crater or indentation where the head and mouthparts were embedded. If portions of the head or mouthparts remain, they may be removed by a doctor. Thoroughly cleanse the bite area with soap and water or a mild disinfectant. Observe the area for several days for development of a reaction to the bite (rash or signs of infection). Apply antibiotic cream to the area as a precaution. Application of an antibiotic to the area may help prevent a local infection but usually does not affect the chance of developing diseases transmitted by the tick. Wash hands thoroughly after handling any tick or instruments that touched a tick. Clean and disinfect any instruments that were used. Find the tick on the skin, and with your finger (preferably a gloved finger), rotate the body of the tick clockwise or counterclockwise for about a minute or so. This irritates the tick enough to cause it to let go of the skin and then the tick can be removed by simply touching the tick to scotch tape. Put liquid soap on a cotton ball and cover the tick with the soaked cotton ball for about 15 to 20 seconds; the tick will supposedly release itself from the skin and get caught up in the cotton ball. You can dispose of the tick by placing it and the cotton ball in a sealable plastic bag."
Is it possible to prevent tick bites?,"'Acaricides are chemicals that will kill ticks and mites (anti-tick medication). Acaricides have been used in high-use, confined areas where ticks might be prevalent, such as yards or deer blinds. Reductions of tick habitats (for example, removal of leaf litter, tall grasses, and brush) have been effective in small-scale trials. Newer methods of control include applying acaricides to animal hosts by using baited tubes, boxes, and feeding stations in areas where infected ticks are endemic (for example, some areas with dense deer populations). Biological control with fungi, parasitic nematodes, and parasitic wasps may also help reduce the tick population. Avoid tick season completely by staying away from outdoor areas where ticks thrive, usually during the months of April through September in the U.S. In addition, application of acaricides (chemicals that kill ticks and mites) can be applied to large areas of land to reduce the tick and ''mite'' population. Removing litter and brush from areas where people live and work may reduce exposure to ticks.''The third web citation below has the CDC recommended methods (tips) for outdoor workers (and others) to avoid getting tick bites (how to become relatively tick-safe) and is summarized here:''Consider wearing tick repellent clothing if you spend significant amount of time in potential tick areas. Be sure to treat pets with flea and tick repellents. If ticks are removed from pets, manage them the same way you would remove a tick on a person. Protect yourself from the potential exposures with gloves. People who live in a tick-infested area and have experienced a fever within the last two months should not donate blood.'   Avoid grassy areas and shrubs where ticks populations may be high and where they reside, waiting to grab a ride on a potential host. Wear light-colored clothing so ticks can be easily seen, and brush them off. Tuck pants into boots or socks to avoid ticks crawling up loose pant legs. Apply insect repellant and use the brands designed to repel ticks. Follow label instructions. Avoid use of DEET-containing repellents on children. Carefully follow instructions and apply some repellents directly to skin and others to clothing. DEET-containing repellents with concentrations of 15% or less may be suitable for children. These should be carefully applied strictly following label directions. Insect repellents containing permethrins may be applied to clothing but not to skin. In areas that have a high tick population, DEET-containing repellents may need to be reapplied more frequently than for repelling mosquitoes. Follow the package label instructions carefully. Promptly check yourself, others, and pets if exposed to areas where ticks are likely to be located."
What is the prognosis for people who get a tick bite?,"'The great majority of people who get tick bites have no problems during or after the bite. For people with suppressed immune systems (''HIV'', ''cancer'', ''chemotherapy'' patients), the prognosis is still good, but they should contact their physicians and inform them about a tick bite. Also, the faster the tick is removed after a bite, the less likely the tick will transmit pathogens.''The overall prognosis for an individual person changes if the tick transmits a pathogen. The prognosis can range from good to poor and is determined by the disease transmitted, the time to diagnosis, the stage of the disease, and the condition of the patient. Immune-suppressed patients usually have a worse prognosis than otherwise healthy people. Consultation with an infectious-disease specialist is one of the best ways to determine the prognosis for the many diseases that ticks can transmit to people.' "

What are ticks? What are bedbugs?,"'''Ticks'' are arthropods (tick members are mainly hard [''Ixodidae''] or soft [''Argasidae''] ticks) that are obligate blood suckers that can, through bites, transmit diseases to humans and many animals. ''Bedbugs'' (''Cimex'' genus only) are insects that are blood-sucking parasites of some animals and birds that can bite humans but seldom spread disease.' "
What are the differences between ticks and bedbugs?,"'Ticks are primarily found in brushy areas in fields and forests while ''bedbugs'' reside mainly in human dwellings and especially in mattresses, bedding, and in human-used items like furniture. Ticks are arthropods and ''bedbugs'' are insects. Ticks are the second-highest vectors of human diseases (mosquitoes are first) while ''bedbugs'' typically do not spread disease. There are over 800 types of ticks (for example, dog ticks, deer ticks, and lone star ticks are common names, but there are many genus and species names of hard and soft ticks) but only one genus (''Cimex'') of bedbugs and all species have the common ''bedbug'' name.' "
What are the similarities between ticks and bedbugs?,"'Both may cause complications to the bite itself (''allergic'' reactions or ''cellulitis''). Both use a bite-like mechanism to get a blood meal, and both may possess chemicals that are injected to anesthetize the initial bite site. Both may use animals other than humans for a blood meal. Bites from both may rarely cause allergic reactions. Both produce small nymphs during development and larger adults that are easily visible and can be mistaken for each other. Both do not jump or fly.' "
What are risk factors for tick and bedbug bites?,"'The major risk factor for tick bites is ''walking'' in grassy areas without protective clothing or protective chemical repellants. The major risk factors for ''bedbug bites'"" are sleeping in bedding that has an infestation of the insects, a failed extermination effort to rid a structure of bedbugs, or wearing someone's contaminated clothing and not using insect repellants."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of tick and bedbug bites?,"'Bedbugs usually bite at night and just before dawn. Bedbug bites are painless, but severe ''itching'' may occur. The bites may be in lines and form''They are small, and multiple bites can come from one bedbug. Tick bites are also usually painless but may cause ''itching'', burning, redness and rarely, localized ''joint pain'' and/or a ''rash'' near the bite that usually is singular, although multiple bites can result from individual ticks. Some people have allergic reactions immediately after a ''tick bite'' or bedbug bite.'   reddish bumps, rash, or blisters and may occur anywhere on the body."
What diseases do ticks and bedbugs transmit?,"'Although there is some evidence that bedbugs can be vectors for ''hepatitis B'' and ''Chagas disease'', most bedbug bites do not transmit diseases. However, they can cause severe itching and may become infected with bacteria, leading to cellulitis. In North America, the following diseases can be caused by tick bites. A single bite may cause one or more of the following:' Lyme disease Human granulocytic and monocytic ehrlichiosis Babesiosis Relapsing fever Rocky Mountain spotted fever Colorado tick fever Tularemia Q fever Tick paralysis Powassan virus infection Bourbon virus disease Red meat allergy"
What are treatments and home remedies for tick and bedbug bites?,"'Treatment of bedbug bites is not usually not necessary. However, an antiseptic lotion spray with or without a topical antibiotic to reduce itching may be helpful. Ticks firmly attach during the bite. Removal by tweezers is described in detail at https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html. The tick bite itself may be treated as above. However, the disease(s) spread by the bite require specific treatments based on the disease(s).''Home remedies for tick bites include''Home remedies for bedbug bites include''Check with your medical ''caregiver'' before using any of these home remedies.' calamine lotion, rubbing with cut onion, meat tenderizer, and apple cider vinegar. baking soda and water paste, oatmeal baths, menthol toothpaste, witch hazel, aloe vera, lemon juice, and calamine lotion."
What is the prognosis for tick and bedbug bites?,"'The prognosis for bedbug bites is usually excellent, with few individuals developing complications. Tick bites usually have a prognosis from good to fair, depending on what disease(s) they transmit, time taken to get a diagnosis, and how the individual reacts to treatments.' "
Is it possible to prevent tick and bedbug bites?,"'The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) published recommendations to prevent tick-borne diseases that include the use of several products like DEET, picaridin, and others to repel ticks and detail the type of protective clothing to wear and how to eliminate or reduce the habitat of ticks. Similar suggestions are made for bedbug prevention but include heating a room to kill the insects.' "
What is costochondritis?,'Costochondritis is a common form of inflammation of the cartilage where ribs attach to the breastbone (the sternum). The inflammation can involve multiple cartilage areas on both sides of the sternum but usually is on one side only.' 
What is Tietze syndrome?,"'Tietze syndrome is an inflammation of the costochondral cartilages of the upper front of the chest that involves swelling of the joint. Costochondritis is distinguished from Tietze syndrome, a condition also involving ''pain'' in the same area of the front of the chest, by the presence of swelling. Costochondritis is not associated with swelling, as opposed to Tietze syndrome, where swelling is characteristic.' "
What causes costochondritis?,"'The causes of costochondritis are not known and may involve several factors. Possible causes include heredity (genetic predisposition), viruses, and ''trauma'' (injury).''Costochondritis can be an independent health condition by itself or sometimes can be a feature of a more widespread disorder. Examples of health conditions that can feature costochondritis include ''fibromyalgia'', ''psoriatic arthritis'', ''ankylosing spondylitis'', ''reactive arthritis'', ''rheumatoid arthritis'', ''lupus'', and ''inflammatory bowel disease'' (such as ''ulcerative colitis'"" and Crohn's disease).""

What are risk factors for costochondritis?,"'Risk factors for costochondritis include injury to the chest, virus infection, and rheumatic diseases.' "
What are signs and symptoms of costochondritis and Tietze syndrome?,"'While both costochondritis and Tietze syndrome feature symptoms such as localized ''chest pain'' and tenderness, Tietze syndrome also causes swelling over the ribs and cartilage near the breastbone (sternum). Signs and symptoms such as redness, tenderness, and warmth can also be present, but a localized swelling is the distinguishing finding. The chest pain is variable, often sharp, can be confused with ''heart'' pain or ''heart attack'', and can last from hours to weeks. It can cause difficulty with sleeping and even rolling over in bed is sometimes painful. Blood testing (''sedimentation rate'' or ''C-reactive protein'' test) can show signs of inflammation in patients with Tietze syndrome, whereas patients with costochondritis alone typically have normal tests for inflammation.'   Costochondritis is distinguished from Tietze syndrome, a condition also involving pain in the costosternal joint, by the presence of swelling. Costochondritis is not associated with swelling, as opposed to Tietze syndrome, where swelling is characteristic. Tietze syndrome is an inflammation of the costochondral cartilages of the upper front of the chest that involves swelling of the joint."
What health care specialists aid in the diagnosis and treatment of costochondritis and Tietze syndrome?,"'Primary care doctors, including family medicine doctors, general practitioners, and internists, as well as ''rheumatologists'' (medical specialists in musculoskeletal disease and systemic autoimmune conditions) and orthopedists (medical specialists in disorders of the musculoskeletal system) are all health care professionals who aid in the diagnosis and treatment of costochondritis and Tietze syndrome. If a patient goes to an emergency room with chest pain, he or she will see an ''emergency medicine'' doctor.' "
What medical exams and tests do health care professionals use to make a diagnosis of costochondritis and Tietze syndrome?,'Doctors diagnose costochondritis and Tietze syndrome based on the typical history of chest pain localized to the cartilage adjacent to the breastbone as well as the examination findings of tenderness. Swelling is also noted in patients with Tietze syndrome.' 
What is the treatment for costochondritis and Tietze syndrome?,"'Costochondritis can be aggravated by any activity that involves stressing the structures of the front of the chest cage. It is generally best to minimize these activities until the inflammation of the rib and cartilage areas has subsided.''Rest, anti-inflammatory medication, physical therapy, and cortisone injections have been used by doctors treating the inflammation and chest wall pain of both costochondritis and Tietze syndrome.'  "
What are home remedies for costochondritis and Tietze syndrome?,'Ice packs applied to local swelling can sometimes help to reduce chest pain and inflammation. Local ''lidocaine'' analgesic patch (''Lidoderm'') application can reduce pain.' 
What is the prognosis for costochondritis and Tietze syndrome?,'The outlook for costochondritis and Tietze syndrome is generally very good. Most patients respond well to conservative treatments. Recurrences are more likely in those who also have underlying rheumatologic diseases as described above.' 
Is it possible to prevent costochondritis and Tietze syndrome?,'Costochondritis and Tietze syndrome cannot be prevented. Although aggravating the symptoms can be minimized by avoiding injury to the chest wall.' 
What is the tilt-table test?,"'The ''tilt-table test'' is a simple, inexpensive, and informative test that can help identify the causes of ''fainting'"". As its name implies, the tilt table test involves placing a patient on a table with a foot-support, then tilting the table upward. The tilt-table may start off in a horizontal position and be tilted by degrees to a completely vertical position. The patient's ""'blood pressure'', pulse, and symptoms are monitored throughout the test. ' "
Why is the tilt-table test done?,"'The tilt-table test is designed to detect one of the most common causes of ''fainting'' or ''lightheadedness'', a phenomenon known as ''postural hypotension'' (''orthostatic hypotension''). Tilt-table testing may be done when ''heart disease'' is not suspected of being responsible for an attack of fainting (''syncope'') or near-syncope. '  "
What is postural hypotension (orthostatic hypotension)?,"'Postural ''hypotension'' is a common cause of an episode of temporary ''loss of consciousness'' or feelings of lightheadedness. Postural ''hypotension'' results from changing body position from a prone, supine, or sitting position to a more vertical position. Normally, blood tends to pool in the legs due to gravity when a person stands up, potentially reducing the amount of blood available to return to the ''heart''. Nerves to the blood vessels in the legs normally act to compensate for this pooling by constricting, thus sending blood away from the leg veins and toward the heart. However, poor tone of the nerves to blood vessels in the legs can cause this mechanism to fail, resulting in a disproportionate distribution of blood to the legs, instead of returning to the circulation, so the brain receives less oxygen. As a result, a person feels lightheaded and may even faint. ' "
What happens after the tilt-table test?,"'Depending on the presence or absence of signs and symptoms during the tilt-table test, persons with certain forms of temporary loss of consciousness may be admitted to the hospital for observation and further testing. The tilt-table test is also performed on stabilized patients who are in the hospital for evaluation of the cause of temporary loss of consciousness. ' "
Does the tilt-table test hurt?,"'No. It is painless. However, patients may experience symptoms such as feeling lightheaded, nauseated, ''sweating'', or ''weakness''. Any symptoms recorded during the test can help the doctor to diagnose the cause of an episode of temporary loss of consciousness or lightheadedness. ' "
What is the tuberculosis skin test?,"""The tuberculosis skin test determines if someone has developed an immune response to the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). This response can occur if someone currently has TB, if they were exposed to it in the past, or if they received the BCG vaccine against TB (which is not administered in the U.S.). Estimates indicate that one-third of the world's population has latent TB, and around 1.3 million people worldwide die of TB each year. The tuberculin test or PPD (purified protein derivative) test are other names for the tuberculosis skin test.""'The tuberculin skin test is based on the fact that infection with ''M. tuberculosis'' bacterium produces a delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reaction to certain components of the bacterium. Medical professionals extract the components of the organism from TB cultures and are the core elements of the classic tuberculin PPD (also known as purified protein derivative). This PPD material is used for skin testing for tuberculosis. Reaction in the skin to tuberculin PPD begins when specialized immune cells, called T cells, sensitized by prior infection, are attracted by the immune system to the skin site where they release chemical messengers called lymphokines. These lymphokines induce induration (a hard, raised area with clearly defined margins at and around the injection site) through local vasodilation (expansion of the diameter of blood vessels) leading to fluid deposition known as ''edema'', fibrin deposition, and attraction of other types of inflammatory cells to the area.''An incubation period of two to 12 weeks is usually necessary after exposure to the TB bacteria in order for the PPD test to be positive. Anyone can have a TB test, and physicians can perform the test on infants, ''pregnant'' women, or ''HIV''-infected people with no danger. It is only contraindicated in people who have had a severe reaction to a previous tuberculin skin test.' "
How do medical professionals administer the tuberculosis skin test?,"'The standard recommended tuberculin test, known as the Mantoux test, is administered by injecting a 0.1 mL of a liquid containing 5 TU (tuberculin units) of PPD into the top layers of skin (intradermally, immediately under the surface of the skin) of the forearm. Health care providers should use a skin area that is free of abnormalities and away from veins. Typically, medical professionals make the injection using a 27-gauge needle and a tuberculin syringe. Inject the tuberculin PPD just beneath the surface of the skin. A discrete, pale elevation of the skin (a wheal) 6 mm-10 mm in diameter should be produced when the injection is done correctly. This wheal or ""bleb"" is generally quickly absorbed. If it becomes apparent that the first test was improperly administered, another test can be given at once, selecting a site several centimeters away from the original injection.' "
What is the method of reading the tuberculosis skin test?,"'""Reading"" the skin test means detecting a raised, thickened local area of skin reaction, referred to as induration. Induration is the key item to detect, not redness or ''bruising''. Read skin tests 48-72 hours after the injection when the size of the induration is maximal. Tests read after 72 hours tend to underestimate the size of the induration and are not accurate.' "
"How 
do physicians interpret skin test results?","'The basis of the reading of the skin test is the presence or absence and the amount of induration (localized swelling). A physician will measure the diameter of the induration transversely (for example, perpendicular) to the long axis of the forearm and recorded in millimeters. The area of induration (palpable, raised, hardened area) around the site of injection is the reaction to tuberculin. It is important to note that redness is not measured.''A tuberculin reaction is classified as positive based on the diameter of the induration in conjunction with certain patient-specific risk factors. In a healthy person whose immune system is normal, induration greater than or equal to 15 mm is considered a positive skin test. If ''blisters'' are present (vesiculation), the test is also considered positive.''In some groups of people, the test is considered positive if induration less than 15 mm is present. For example, an area of induration of 10 mm is considered positive in the following groups:''An induration of 5 mm is considered positive for the following groups:''On the other hand, a negative test does not always mean that a person is free of tuberculosis. People who have been infected with TB may not have a positive skin test (known as a false negative result) if their immune function is compromised by chronic medical conditions, ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy'', or ''AIDS''. Additionally, 10%-25% of people with newly diagnosed tuberculosis of the ''lungs'' will also have a negative result, possibly due to poor immune function, poor ''nutrition'', accompanying viral infection, or steroid therapy. Over 50% of patients with widespread, disseminated TB (spread throughout the body, known as miliary TB) will also have a negative TB test.''A person who received a BCG vaccine (administered in some countries but not the U.S.) against tuberculosis may also have a positive skin reaction to the TB test, although this is not always the case. This is an example of a false positive result. The positive reaction that is due to the vaccine may persist for years. Those who were vaccinated after the first year of life or who had more than one dose of the vaccine have the greatest likelihood of having a persistent positive result than those who were vaccinated as infants.''People infected with other types of mycobacteria other than ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' may also have false-positive TB skin tests.' Recent immigrants from high-prevalence areas Residents and employees of high-risk areas IV drug abusers Children under 4 years old People who work with mycobacteria in laboratories People with suppressed immune systems HIV-infected people People with changes seen on chest X-ray that are consistent with previous TB Recent contacts of people with TB People who have received organ transplants"
Are there side effects or risks from having the PPD skin test?,"'The test typically does not produce side effects. There is a very slight risk of having a severe reaction to the test, including swelling and redness of the arm, particularly in people who have had tuberculosis or been infected previously and in those who have previously had the BCG vaccine. ''Allergic'' reactions are also rare complications.''Since the test does not use live bacteria, so there is no chance of developing tuberculosis from the test.'  "
What is athlete's foot? What are causes and risk factors of athlete's foot?,"""Athlete's foot is a term given to almost any inflammatory skin disease that affects the sole of the foot and the skin between the toes. It is usually scaly and may be a red, raw-appearing eruption with weeping and oozing with small ""'blisters''. It affects the feet of athletes and non-athletes alike. Although it is frequently caused by a fungal infection, other causes may be indistinguishable without proper testing.'""The medical name for fungal athlete's foot is ""'tinea pedis'"". There are a variety of fungi that cause athlete's foot, and these can be contracted in many locations, including gyms, locker rooms, ""'swimming'' pools, communal showers, nail salons, and from contaminated socks and clothing. The fungi can also be spread directly from person to person by contact. Most people acquire fungus on the feet from walking barefoot in areas where someone else with athlete\'s foot has recently walked. Some people are simply more prone to this condition while others seem relatively resistant to it. Another colorful name for this condition is ""jungle rot,"" often used by members of the armed services serving in tropical climates.'""Fungal infections are promoted by warmth and moisture. There is some speculation that before enclosed shoes became common, tinea pedis was less prevalent. Up to 70% of the population may develop athlete's foot at some time. An infection by athlete's foot fungi does not confer any resistance to subsequent infections."" "
What are the symptoms and signs of athlete's foot?,"""Many individuals with athlete's foot have no symptoms at all and do not even know they have an infection. Many may think they simply have ""'dry skin'"" on the soles of their feet. Common symptoms of athlete's foot typically include various degrees of ""'itching'', stinging, and burning. The skin may frequently peel, and in particularly severe cases, there may be some cracking, fissuring, ''pain'"", and itching in the toe webs. Occasionally, athlete's foot can ""'blister''.'  "
What does athlete's foot look like?,"""Fungal athlete's foot may cause a ""'rash'' on one or both feet and even involve the hand. A ""two feet and one hand"" pattern is a very common presentation of athlete\'s foot, especially in men. Hand fungal infections are called tinea manuum. Fungal athlete\'s foot may also be seen along with ''ringworm'' of the groin (especially in men) or hand(s). It is helpful to examine the feet whenever there is a fungal groin ''rash'' called ''tinea cruris'', or ''jock itch'"". It is important to treat all areas of fungal infection at one time to avoid reinfection. Simply treating the soles and ignoring the concurrent fungal infection of toenails may result in recurrences of athlete's foot."" "
Is athlete's foot contagious?,"""If athlete's foot is caused by a fungus, it is potentially contagious. Some people do not develop infection of the skin after exposure to the fungus. The exact cause of resistance or susceptibility to fungal infections is unknown."" "
What else causes foot rashes?,"'There are many possible causes of foot ''rashes''. Additional causes include irritant or ''contact dermatitis'', ''allergic'' ''rashes'' from shoes or other creams, pompholyx (''dyshidrotic eczema''), ''psoriasis'', yeast infections, and ''bacterial infections'' (gram negative toe web infection and erythrasma). Since these conditions are often indistinguishable on superficial visual examination, it is important for your doctor to do his best to identify the precise cause. Since fungal infections are potentially curable, it is important not to miss this diagnosis.''Your physician may perform a simple test called a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation for microscopic fungal examination in the office or laboratory. This test can be used to confirm the presence of a fungal infection. This test is performed by using a microscope to examine small flakes of skin from the rash. Many dermatologists perform this test in their office with results available within minutes. Rarely, a small piece of skin may be removed and sent for biopsy or fungal culture to help confirm the diagnosis.'  "
What are risk factors for athlete's foot?,"'Walking barefoot in wet, dark areas frequented by many other individuals like indoor swimming pool decks, communal showers, and locker rooms result in frequent exposure to pathogenic fungi (dermatophytes) that cause athlete’s foot. Wearing occlusive footwear is thought to play a significant role in the increased frequency of tinea pedis. Exposure to moisture either from ''excessive sweating'' or from an external source is a risk factor. Wearing the same shoes and socks for an extended period may damage the skin. Patients with ''diabetes'' are predisposed to develop tinea pedis. Some believe that ''eczema'' (''atopic dermatitis'') can predispose one to tinea pedis. It appears that many more men have tinea pedis than women. ''Pedicure'' performed in contaminated environments can spread disease.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose athlete's foot?,"""The most reliable way to diagnose athlete’s foot is to correctly identify its cause. Fungal athlete's foot is relatively straightforward to diagnose and treat. Visualization of the fungus in skin scrapings removed from the affected areas of the feet is a painless and cost-effective method for diagnosis. Rarely, it is necessary to identify fungi in portions of skin removed during a biopsy. If no fungus is found, other causes of athlete's foot must be investigated."" "
What is the treatment for athlete's foot?,"'Since there is no single cause for athlete’s foot there is no single treatment. Nevertheless, all causes of this condition benefit by promoting a dry, clean, and friction-free environment for the feet.''Occlusive shoe materials, such as vinyl, which cause the feet to remain moist, provide an excellent area for the fungus to proliferate. Likewise, absorbent socks like cotton that wick water away from your feet may help. Some individuals who sweat excessively benefit from the application of antiperspirants like 20% aluminum chloride (''Drysol'""). Powders can help keep your feet dry. Although counterintuitive, if your feet can be soaked in a solution of aluminum acetate (Burow's solution or ""'Domeboro'' solution) and then air dried with a fan, this can be very helpful if performed three or four times within 30 minutes. A home remedy of dilute white vinegar soaks, using one part vinegar and roughly four parts water, once or twice a day (as 10-minute foot soaks) may aid in treatment followed by evaporation can be helpful.''For fungus infection, there are plenty of options. Many medications are available, including ''miconazole'' (''Micatin'', Zeasorb powder), econazole (Spectazole), ''clotrimazole'' (Lotrimin), ''terbinafine'' (''Lamisil''), naftifine (''Naftin''), butenafine (''Mentax''), ''ciclopirox'' (''Loprox''), ''ketoconazole'' (''Nizoral''), ''efinaconazole'' (''Jublia''), luliconazole (Luzu), sertaconazole (Ertaczo), sulconazole (Exelderm), and tolnaftate (Tinactin). Ask your health care professional or pharmacist for a recommendation. It is difficult to know which of these ''drugs'"" is most effective since they have not been tested against each other. Cost is probably the most significant differentiating factor, and many are available without a prescription. Treatment for athlete's foot should generally be continued for four weeks or at least one week after all of the skin symptoms have cleared.""""More advanced or resistant cases of athlete's foot may require a course of an oral (pill) antifungal like terbinafine (Lamisil), ""'itraconazole'' (''Sporanox''), or ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan''). Laboratory blood tests to make sure there is no ''liver disease'' may be required before taking these pills.''Topical ''corticosteroid'' creams can act as a ""fertilizer"" for fungus and may actually worsen fungal skin infections by suppressing the body\'s immune defenses. These topical steroid medications have no role in treating fungal foot infections but can be quite effective in treating noninfectious causes of athlete’s foot.'""If the fungal infection has spread to the toenails, the nails must also be treated to avoid reinfection of the feet. Often, the nails are initially ignored only to find the athlete's foot keeps recurring. It is important to treat all of the visible fungus at the same time. Effective ""'nail fungus'' treatment may be more intensive and require prolonged courses (three to four months) of oral antifungal medications.' "
What home remedies are available for athlete's foot?,"'Multiple home remedies are available, including vinegar soaks, dilute Clorox soaks, and shampoos like Head & Shoulders or ''Selsun Blue''. Other reported but unverified remedies have included Vicks Vapor Rub and Epsom salts.' Dilute vinegar soaks or sprays (roughly one part white household vinegar to four parts water) Dilute Clorox baths or soaks (approximately ¼ cup household Clorox bleach in one bathtub of water)"
How can I treat athlete's foot in pregnancy?,'Treatment options during ''pregnancy'' may include dilute vinegar soaks or sprays (roughly one part white household vinegar to four parts water) and Lotrimin cream twice a day for two to three weeks to the soles. Antifungal pills are generally not recommended during pregnancy because of the potential side effects and possible fetal harm. Always check with your OB/GYN before using any medication or treatment during pregnancy.' 
When should someone seek medical care for athlete's foot?,"'If you notice any redness, increased swelling, bleeding, or if your infection is not clearing up, see your health care professional. If a bacterial infection is also occurring, an antibiotic pill may be necessary. If you have fungal nail involvement, are diabetic, or have a compromised immune system, you should also see your physician for treatment.' "
What are possible complications of athlete's foot?,"""Untreated, fungal athlete's foot can potentially spread to other body parts or other people, including family members. Fungus may spread locally to the legs, toenails, hands, fingernails, and essentially any body area.""'This type of fungus generally likes to live in the skin, hair, and nails. It does not invade deep, go into body organs, or go into the blood system.''Fungal infections of the nails are called ''tinea unguium'' or ''onychomycosis''. ''Nail fungus'' may be very difficult to treat. Antifungal pills may be required in cases of more advanced toenail fungal infections.''People with ''diabetes'', ''HIV/AIDS'', ''cancer'', or other immune problems may be more prone to all kinds of infections, including fungus. In patients with ''diabetes'', fungal infections may lead to potentially dangerous foot ulcerations.''When the skin is injured or damaged, the natural protective skin barrier is broken. Bacteria and yeasts can then invade the broken skin. Bacteria can cause a bad smell. Bacterial infection of the skin and resulting inflammation is known as ''cellulitis''. This is especially likely to occur in individuals with diabetes, chronic ''leg swelling'', who have had veins removed (such as for ''heart'' bypass surgery), or in the elderly. Bacterial skin infections also occur more frequently in patients with impaired immune systems.'

What is the prognosis of athlete's foot?,'It is very likely that you will have a positive outcome and your athlete’s foot will resolve with the correct diagnosis.' 
How can I prevent future athlete's foot infections?,"'Since some people are simply more prone to fungal infections, they are also prone to repeated infection. Preventive measures include keeping your feet clean and dry, avoiding prolonged moist environments, using socks in airport security lines, removing shoes, and allowing the feet skin to ""breathe,"" avoiding walking barefoot, especially in public areas like swimming pools and gyms, avoiding contact with known infected people, and avoiding soaking and contaminated tool usage at nail salons. Weekly applications of a topical antifungal foot cream or sprinkling of antifungal foot powder (Zeasorb Foot Powder) into shoes may also be helpful.''It is imperative to take your own nail instruments, including nail files, to any public nail salon, unless you know the salon practices strict instrument sterilization and/or uses all disposable supplies.'""Use cotton socks whenever possible.

What is tinea versicolor? What are tinea versicolor symptoms and signs?,"'Tinea versicolor is a common fungal infection of the skin that often affects adolescents and young adults. The term ''versicolor'' refers to the fact that it frequently alters the color of involved skin. The most common areas it affects are the shoulders, back, and chest. At times, it can affect folds of skin, such as the crook of the arm, the skin under the breasts, or the groin. It usually spares the face, although this is not always true for children. Careful examination of the affected areas will reveal a slight increase in superficial scale. The disease rarely produces any symptoms.'  "
What causes tinea versicolor? Is tinea versicolor contagious?,"'A yeast called ''Malassezia'' causes tinea versicolor; it normally lives on the skin of most adults without producing a disease. It exists in two forms, a yeast form and a form that resembles ""penne and meatballs"" when viewed microscopically. This second form produces the patches of discolored slightly scaly skin called tinea versicolor. Currently, medical professionals believe that a chemical produced by ''Malassezia'', azelaic acid, is responsible for the loss of pigment. Most people with this condition are perfectly healthy.''Because the tinea versicolor fungus is part of the normal adult skin flora, this condition is not overtly ''contagious''. It often recurs after treatment, but usually not right away, so that treatment may need to be repeated only every year or two.' "
What other conditions resemble tinea versicolor?,"'The following conditions are sometimes indistinguishable from tinea versicolor on simple inspection:'   Pityriasis alba: This is a mild form of eczema (seen in young people) that produces mild, patchy lightening of the face, shoulders, or torso. Vitiligo: This condition results in a permanent loss of pigment. Vitiligo is more likely to affect the skin around the eyes and lips or the knuckles and joints. Spots are porcelain white and, unlike those of tinea versicolor, are permanent without therapy."
How do health care professionals diagnose tinea versicolor?,"'It is relatively simple procedure to confirm this diagnosis. A drop of potassium hydroxide is applied to a small scraping of involved skin, which is then examined under the microscope. The penne-and-meatball forms can be seen and confirm the diagnosis.'  "
What is the treatment for tinea versicolor?,"'There are many antifungal agents available to apply to the skin for the treatment of tinea versicolor. ''Over-the-counter'' (OTC) remedies include ''clotrimazole'' (Lotrimin, Mycelex), ''miconazole'' (Lotrimin), and ''ciclopirox'' (Ciclodan, ''Penlac'', ''Loprox'').''Apply these twice a day for 10-14 days. Unfortunately, these come in small tubes and are hard to apply to large areas. Sprays of clotrimazole are available and can be a more practical treatment approach. Another OTC option is selenium sulfide shampoo 1% (''Selsun Blue'') or 1% ''ketoconazole'' shampoo (''Nizoral''). Some doctors recommend applying these for 15 minutes twice a week for two to four weeks.''There are also many prescription-strength antifungal creams that can treat tinea versicolor, as well as a stronger form of selenium sulfide (2.5%) and prescription-strength ketoconazole shampoo (2%). However, these pose the same application problems as their OTC counterparts.''Oral treatment for tinea versicolor has the advantage of simplicity. Two doses of ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan'') or ''itraconazole'' (''Sporanox'') a week for four weeks can be quite effective. Some common medications such as ''alprazolam'' (''Xanax'') and ''montelukast'' (''Singulair'') may interact with fluconazole, so your doctor will need to know what other medications you take before treating tinea versicolor orally. ''Terbinafine'' is not an effective treatment for this disease.'  "
What is the prognosis of tinea versicolor?,"'As noted above, the white spots of tinea versicolor tends to linger even after successful treatment. This persistent discoloration often leads people to think that the condition is still present long after its eradication. It may take months for skin color to blend and look normal, but it always does. The red or brown variety of ''rash'', on the other hand, clears up much sooner. It is, therefore, a good idea to have the condition treated as soon as new spots appear so that any discoloration lasts as short a time as possible.''Recurrence of the ''rash'"" is common, though it won't recur necessarily every year. Applying selenium sulfide or ketoconazole shampoo on affected areas once a week may slow the onset of recurrence but is cumbersome and often not worth the effort, since the condition may not come back for a long time anyway."" "
Is it possible to prevent tinea versicolor?,"""Since the organism that causes tinea versicolor is a normal inhabitant of the skin and the disease does not affect the patient's general health, there is no widely accepted approach to ""'prevention''.' "
What causes tinnitus?,"""There are numerous causes for tinnitus include infection inner ear damage, loud noise, medications, Meniere's syndrome, and brain aneurysm.""'Tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease, and it has a variety of causes that may arise anywhere in the hearing mechanism. It begins in the ear with the tympanic membrane and the cochlea, where the sound is transmitted and transformed into electrical energy for the brain to perceive.' 

Read Doctor's View
   Blood flow and/or tumors: Tinnitus that is throbbing (pulsatile) may be due to blood flow through arteries and veins adjacent to the ear, as well as tumors that are vascular, meaning that they have increased blood flow within them. Muscle spasms: Tinnitus that is described as clicking may be due to abnormalities that cause the muscle in the roof of the mouth (palate) to go into spasm. This causes the Eustachian tube, which helps equalize pressure in the ears, to repeatedly open and close. Multiple sclerosis and other neurologic diseases that are associated with muscle spasms may also be a cause of tinnitus, as they may lead to spasms of certain muscles in the middle ear that can cause repetitive clicking. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) abnormalities may cause a repeated clicking sound in the ear. Damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve: Damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve responsible for transmitting sound from the ear to the brain may cause tinnitus. Causes may include drug toxicity or a tumor (for example, acoustic neuroma). Meniere's disease, which is associated with hearing loss and vertigo also may cause tinnitus. Aging: As people age, their hearing may decrease and there can be associated tinnitus. Otosclerosis: Otosclerosis, which is caused by abnormal bone growth in the middle ear, can sometimes cause tinnitus. Trauma may also be a cause of tinnitus and hearing loss. This includes barotrauma, whereby air pressure changes can damage ear function. Examples of barotrauma include pressure changes from scuba diving or changes in air pressure when flying."
What are the symptoms of tinnitus?,"   The sound of tinnitus may be constant or it may come and go intermittently. 
	 It may be throbbing.  It may occur in one ear or in both ears.  Most 
often, the sound is a high pitched continuous tone, but it may also be described 
by the patient as a click, buzz, or a hum.  Tinnitus is often associated with hearing loss and the patient may complain 
of decreased hearing, even if the tinnitus is absent."
What kind of doctor treats tinnitus?,"'Often tinnitus can be evaluated by a primary-care doctor or internist, but if consultation is needed, an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat doctor) is the specialist that evaluates and cares for people with tinnitus. Audiologists are trained to perform hearing tests and assessments. ' "
How is tinnitus diagnosed?,"""The patient's history and description of symptoms is the key in determining what might be causing tinnitus.""'The health-care professional may ask questions in regard to the quality of the abnormal sound, and whether it is constantly present or whether it comes and goes. Other questions may include the following:''Medications:'' Be prepared to provide the health-care professional a list of medications including ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) and ''supplements'' to review since tinnitus may be a side effect of certain medications.''Physical exam:'' Physical examination will focus on the head and neck, and especially the ears, including the auditory canals and tympanic membranes. Since the sense of hearing is conducted through one of the cranial nerves (the short nerves that lead directly from the brain to the face, head and neck), a careful neurologic exam also may be performed. ''Weakness'' or numbness in the face, mouth, and neck may be associated with a tumor or other structural abnormality pressing on a nerve. The healthcare professional may listen to the flow in the carotid arteries in the neck for an abnormal sound (bruit), since carotid artery stenosis (narrowing of the artery) can transmit a sound to the ear that may cause tinnitus.''Hearing test:'' An audiogram or hearing test may be performed to look for associated hearing loss in one or both ears.''Imaging:'' Depending upon the suspected underlying cause of tinnitus, radiology tests may be performed to image the head and neck, including the structures of the ear. These imaging tests may include ''CT scan'', ''MRI'' and ''ultrasound''.''Referral to a specialist:'' Consultation with the appropriate specialist may be needed, both for diagnosis and treatment.' Does it involve one or both ears? Does the sound pulsate, or does it sound like a rush or flow? Does it click? Has there been recurrent exposure to loud noises or sound at work, at home or at play? Is there associated decreased hearing or hearing loss? Does the person feel a sensation of spinning (vertigo)?"
What are the treatments for tinnitus?,"'Tinnitus is a common complaint, with up to 15% of Americans having experienced it. It is the most common symptom reported by military service members returning from combat.' 

Read Doctor's View
   Tinnitus may last for weeks or months, and then resolve spontaneously. For some people tinnitus may last for years. The tinnitus may be significant enough to interfere with an individual's activities of daily living. For this reason, treatment must also be directed at decreasing the effects of tinnitus on a person's daily life, such as depression, insomnia, etc. For those people whose tinnitus is caused by an adverse or toxic reaction to a medication, stopping the drug may allow the hearing mechanism to recover; however, talk with your doctor before stopping any medication. Sometimes the adverse effects of medications on hearing may be permanent. Electrical stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation are some of the other treatment considerations available for certain individuals with tinnitus."
What home remedies soothe tinnitus symptoms?,"'The following home remedies may be of benefit to some individuals with tinnitus.' Dietary restrictions including avoiding caffeine and decreasing salt intake Smoking cessation Zinc supplements Melatonin 
Ginkgo biloba"
What medications treat tinnitus?," Benzodiazepine medications, including 
	alprazolam (Xanax), may help suppress nerve function and decrease 
	tinnitus symptoms. 
	 Corticosteroid injections into the middle ear may decrease inflammation in certain cases of tinnitus. Antidepressant medications may decrease the intensity of tinnitus or resolve the noise altogether. 
	Moreover,
	antidepressants may also help with the 
	depression that is sometimes associated with the presence of persistent and chronic tinnitus. Prostaglandin analogues, such as 
	misoprostol (Cytotec), may be of some help in some 
	people with tinnitus. "
Is there surgery to cure tinnitus?,"'Surgery may be a cure for certain people who have:' Meniere's disease (characterized by tinnitus, vertigo, and decreased 
	hearing)  Tinnitus due to glomus tumors Acoustic neuromas Sigmoid sinus diverticulum or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)"
What is retraining therapy and relief therapy?,"'There are some behavioral and cognitive therapies that have been successful in treating tinnitus. Seeking out a multidisciplinary program at a medical center that specializes in tinnitus may improve treatment success.''Tinnitus retraining therapy'' is a form of treatment that tries to retrain the nerve pathways associated with hearing that may allow the brain to get used to the abnormal sounds. Habituation allows the brain to ignore the tinnitus noise signal, and it allows the person to become unaware that it is present unless they specifically concentrate on the noise. This treatment involves counseling and wearing a sound generator. Audiologists and otolaryngologists often work together in offering this treatment.''In addition to tinnitus retraining therapy, other treatments exist which attempt to relieve tinnitus such as ''relief therapy'', and each affected individual may benefit differently depending upon the cause of the tinnitus and their response to treatment. Some other treatment options include the following:'   Masking Biofeedback 
Stress reduction Depression counseling Electrical stimulation for patients with hearing loss"
Does acupuncture treat tinnitus symptoms?,"'While scientific research has not shown the benefit of ''acupuncture'' in the treatment of tinnitus, there may be a significant positive placebo effect.' "
Can tinnitus be prevented?,"'Repeated loud noise exposure can be a cause of tinnitus as well as hearing loss. Loud music may cause short term symptoms, but repeated occupational exposure (for example, musicians, factory and construction workers) requires less intense sound levels to cause potential hearing damage leading to tinnitus. Minimizing sound exposure, therefore, decreases the risk of developing tinnitus. Sound protection equipment, like acoustic ear-muffs, may be appropriate at work and at home when exposed to loud noises.''A variety of medications may be ototoxic (damage the ear) and cause tinnitus. If tinnitus develops while you are taking a medication, stop the medication and discuss other options with your health-care professional.'  "
What's being done in research on tinnitus treatments?,"'Tinnitus remains a symptom that affects the lives of millions of people. Research is directed not only at its treatment, but also at understanding why it occurs. Research by doctors at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Dalhousie University (Canada), and Southeast China University have published research using electrophysiology and functional MRI to better understand what parts of the brain are involved in hearing and the production of tinnitus. Their research has found that much larger areas of the brain are involved with the process of hearing than previously believed, which may help direct future diagnostic and therapeutic options.' "
What is TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt)?,'Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or (TIPS) is a shunt (tube) placed between the portal vein which carries blood from the ''intestines'' and intraabdominal organs to the ''liver'' and the hepatic vein which carries blood from the liver back to the vena cava and the ''heart''. '  
What is TIPS used for?,"'It is used primarily (but not exclusively) in patients with ''cirrhosis'' in which the ''scar tissue'' within the liver causes partial blockage of flow of blood passing through the liver from the portal vein to the hepatic vein. The blockage increases the pressure in the portal vein, which is called ''portal hypertension''. As a result of the increase in pressure, portal blood flows preferentially or shunts through the branches of the portal vein to veins coming from abdominal organs that normally drain toward the portal vein. These organs connect with veins that do not empty into the portal vein and thus bypass the liver. Thus, much of the flow of blood bypasses the liver. If these veins going to the other organs enlarge, they are referred to as variceal veins or varices. Unfortunately, one of the places varices form is in the stomach and lower ''esophagus'', and these varices have a tendency to bleed massively, frequently causing death from exsanguination. By providing an artificial path for blood traveling from the intestines, through, the liver, and back to the heart, the shunt placed during the TIPS procedure reduces the pressure in the portal vein, significantly decreasing the likelihood of varices bleeding.' "
How is TIPS performed?,"'There are several types of portosystemic shunts that are placed surgically, but TIPS is a non-surgical method of placing a portosystemic shunt. The shunt is passed down the jugular vein from the neck by a radiologist using X-ray guidance. The shunt then is inserted between the portal and hepatic veins within the liver.' "
What are the complications of TIPS?,"'There are two important complications of the TIPS procedure.  The first is ''hepatic encephalopathy'', a condition in which it is believed that toxic products from the intestines (for example, ammonia) that are normally removed from the blood by the liver remain in the blood and are delivered to the brain.  (The TIPS allows the toxin-containing blood to bypass the liver.)  The effects on the brain can vary from minor alterations in thinking to full ''coma''.''A second complication is ''heart failure'' due to the sudden increase in the amount of blood returning to the heart through the shunt.  The heart is unable to pump the returning blood fast enough, resulting in heart failure.''Finally, one complication may be caused by the shunt itself; problems such as infection and shunt occlusion, requiring placement of another shunt.'  "
Introduction to parenting teens,"'Experiencing and surviving the teen years is challenging for both parents and adolescents. All parents can conjure up personal recollections of the experience -- and are absolutely sure that they ""had it much harder"" than their child. Similarly, we mature adults are now clever enough to realize all the inappropriate, risky, and ""just plain stupid"" things we did (and thus put our parents through). As parents, we want to shield our children from all the frustrations and disappointments we experienced -- and as bonus -- free ourselves from the fate our own parents were forced to endure.''Unfortunately, try as we might, history often repeats itself. Our goal as parents is to hopefully reduce the impact of the crash landings our adolescent children will invariably experience. Try as we might, we must ultimately take off the training wheels and watch as they weave all over the road and accept that occasionally knees will get scraped. (Our main responsibility is to make sure that a helmet is always worn.) In other words, we must do our best to protect them from the most severe consequences of their inexperience.' "
13 tips for dealing with your ADHD teen,"'You face unique challenges ''parenting'' a teen who has ''ADHD''. Here are some tips and strategies to help you with the task.'   Live in the here and now. Deal with the current situation or issue. Rehashing prior problems aggravates everyone and accomplishes nothing. Skip the lectures and ""I told you so."" Be compassionate about your teen's condition. Teens (like everyone) dislike being blamed or criticized for their behavior. Disorganization and forgetfulness are not purposeful behaviors for teens with ADHD. Better to collaborate with your child and his teachers to lessen such experiences. There are no excusing behaviors that do have a voluntary component. Impulsivity is a basic feature of ADHD; shoplifting or purposefully damaging an item is not. Keep calm. Shouting matches rarely accomplish the desired goal. While parenting styles may differ, it is better to adhere to a rational reminder of expected behavior and enforcement of a reasonable (and already agreed upon) penalty. When in doubt, behave like Judge Judy; make your point and move on. Anticipate pitfalls. A good general never enters a battle they know they are going to lose. Parents should be one step ahead of their ADHD teen -- anticipate problems and either proactively attempt to resolve the issue or realize that ""screw-ups"" will happen and work out as a couple how you will handle such events in a constructive and calm manner. Set boundaries and stick to them. Whatever you do as a frustrated parent, don't decree an unenforceable penalty. If this strategy didn't work when he was 2 years old and he couldn't leave the table until he ate his carrots, it won't work 15 years later when you announce he's grounded for the rest of the year. To quote your child, ""Yeah, right!"" Focus on the positive! Don't just focus on the negative aspects of your teen's behavior; remember to praise him or her when they do well. Ditch power struggles. Adolescents do better with concrete information that has a limited option for misinterpretation. Write down basic rules and the consequences for failure to follow through. These ""contracts"" should be bidirectional -- from parent to teen (for example, car privileges) as well as teen to parents (for example, payment for supervising younger siblings). Help your teen develop social skills. Teens who have ADHD may have difficulty interacting with others. Help your teen develop social skills such as listening, not interrupting when other are speaking, and maintaining a conversation. These skills may be especially important for individuals who have associated behavioral conditions (for example, autism) with their ADHD. Listen to your teen. Teach your ADHD teen how to explain their feelings. Instead of hurling insults back and forth, let your child rant and rave without any interruptions. The only rule: no profanity, name-calling, or insults. When your teen is done, announce that you are glad you listened to their ideas and need to think about them for one to two days and would like to talk again about the issue. The only ""must"" -- you have to have the follow-up conversation you promised. Stand your ground on important topics. Your teen will understand the concept that big offenses should warrant a big penalty. Fairness and justice require this tradeoff. Since teens with ADHD are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors (especially if they are not taking ADHD-directed medication), there should be a zero tolerance for illegal or dangerous behaviors. These high-risk behaviors (for example, driving, use of alcohol/drugs, truancy, etc.) should be addressed in a contract between parent and teen. Demonstrated infraction = non-negotiable penalty. Case closed. Encourage good nutrition. Eliminate junk food, sugar, and excessively fatty foods from your household. Stick to regular meal times to help maintain your child's energy levels. Set appropriate boundaries. Much to your teen's frustration, your home is not a democracy. A benevolent dictatorship is a better analogy. A family meeting to discuss acceptable options and the consequences for failure to meet these expectations is reasonable. Enforcement of such consequences should be non-negotiable (for example, ""All B's or no car keys""). Give your teen choices. Allowing your child to choose between options promotes confidence and autonomy while helping your teen to feel more like an adult."
ADHD teens and driving,"'Three areas -- driving, homework, and alcohol/''drugs'' -- are areas that may spark a fire between the parents of a teen with ADHD and their child. It is appropriate that parents anticipate and formulate a plan to address these issues with their adolescent.''Motor-vehicle accidents are the number-one cause of death in children 16-20 years of age. Approximately 63% of the deaths are drivers; the remainder of those killed are passengers. Driving requires focus, ''concentration'', good judgment, and the ability to adapt to sudden and often unpredictable changes in the immediate environment. The younger the driver the more likely a lack of experience and behavioral immaturity will result in risk-taking behaviors. It is imperative that parents lay out concrete concepts and consequences for their young ADHD driver. These might include the following:'   Driving is a privilege. It needs to be earned and may be forfeited for infractions. A teen with ADHD must take his medication. Limit passengers for the first six to 12 months of driving -- only family members (including siblings). Limit rush-hour, freeway, and late-night driving for the first six months of driving. Practice with parents to gain the necessary skills for such a high-stakes environment. Consider a no cell phone, CD, or music car environment; all of these elements provide distraction to an equal degree. Hands-free cell usage is not superior in safety when compared with non-hands-free cell phone use."
"ADHD teens, school, and homework","'Middle school and high school can be a minefield to effectively negotiate for teens regardless of whether they have to deal with the effects of ADHD or not. Part of the issue is the ""nature of the beast."" Students must learn how to effectively deal with multiple teachers who believe that their subject is the linchpin holding the teen\'s entire academic experience together. Likewise, the usual lack of integration of the school curriculum may be another hurdle to overcome. Parents should be their child\'s advocate with his or her teacher. Establish a good rapport and communication between your child\'s teacher and yourself. This implies a give and take regarding their adolescent\'s ADHD diagnosis, possible side effects of his/her medication, and informing the teacher of any comorbid learning disorders and learning styles (for example, visual vs. auditory) which will promote success. Often such information and teacher feedback may be exchanged using a school\'s email system. At home, parents can strive to maximize an effective learning environment. Organize an area for homework and limit distractions. Provide structure with consistency for start and finish times. Several studies have demonstrated that one hour of vigorous physical activity after school and before starting homework allows for more efficient use of time, quicker mastery of the material, and improvement in accuracy in subjects requiring calculations. (Simply put -- the ADHD teen needs to ""''burn'' off"" his or her extra energy.) Since nothing succeeds like success, praise your teen when they have worked hard and done their best.'""Teens with ADHD and their parents may note that homework projects are often much more challenging from 7:00 p.m. and later. Often their medication effectiveness has waned to minimal. Speak with your teen's pediatrician. One option is to take a short-acting (three- to four-hour duration) version of the same medication taken in the morning. Taking this preparation at about 6 p.m. will enable continued effectiveness for academics but should not interfere with dinner appetite or ""'sleep'' patterns.''While the natural inclination of a parent is to intercede to resolve problems between their ADHD teen and an instructor, a better long-term strategy involves the student and teacher discussing the problematic issues without the direct input of others. Teens need to learn how to present their case in a rational way. Such an approach will guard against a parent from being trapped between their teen and the teacher. There are always two sides to any story. Better results usually occur when the discussion is restricted to the two principal parties involved. Otherwise parents may become the victims of hearsay.'  "
"ADHD teens, alcohol, and drugs","'Alcohol and drug usage is a frequent topic among teens. The inclination toward experimentation and testing boundaries, a sense of invincibility and immortality, and poor judgment regarding long-term consequences for their actions provide the ""perfect storm"" for many teens. An adolescent burdened with uncontrolled ADHD is a setup for disaster. Parental expectations -- specifically enumerated -- provide a necessary foundation. No alcohol or ''drug use'"" is to be tolerated. No attendance at parties where alcohol is consumed is acceptable, even if adult supervision is anticipated. Monitor alcohol types and quantities at home. Know your teen's friends and never hesitate to call their parents if you are concerned regarding unusual or suspicious behaviors. Watch for signs and symptoms of alcohol/drug use: unusual redness in the whites of their eyes; characteristic breath odor or frequent use of breath mints or mouthwash (which may itself contain alcohol); changes in personality (for example, emotional lability, moodiness, etc.); or deterioration academically. Don't hesitate to monitor your adolescent's activities and expect resistance. Be strong; it's your job."" "
Alcohol use by children,"'Below is a current survey of American children and alcohol usage.

What causes coughing?,"'A ''cough'' is a reflex that helps clear your airways of irritants. Nerves in the airways become stimulated by allergens, medical conditions, medications, and other irritants, resulting in a forceful expulsion of air from the ''lungs''.''There are numerous causes for ''coughing''.

19 natrual and home remedies to cure and soothe a cough,"'Once the cause of your cough is diagnosed and you have ruled out any serious underlying medical conditions that need to be treated, symptoms of cough often may be treated or cured with home remedies. ''Talk to your doctor before using any herbal remedies or natural ''supplements'' as some may interact with medications you take.'   Stay hydrated: Drink lots of water to thin mucus. Inhale steam: Take a hot shower, or boil water and pour into a bowl, face the bowl (stay at least 1 foot away), place a towel over the back of your head to form a tent and inhale. Stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Note: do not do this if cough is due to asthma, as steam may make symptoms worse. Use a humidifier to loosen mucus. Cough drops or lozenges soothe an irritated throat (do not use in young children). Saltwater gargle clears mucus from the throat. Use an extra pillow to elevate your head at night. Don't smoke and avoid secondhand smoke. Avoid inhaled irritants such as dust, perfumes, or pollutants. Use honey. It can be used alone in adults and children over 1 year of age, and acts as a cough suppressant. Ginger tea soothes throat inflammation. Eucalyptus oil: Use it in a vaporizer or rub on your chest to help break up mucus. Mint: Often taken as a tea, it helps loosen mucus in the lungs. Menthol is commonly found in lozenges, and it can soothe a cough. Licorice root acts as an expectorant. Slippery elm coats and soothes the throat. Apple cider vinegar (diluted or mixed with honey) helps thin mucus. Turmeric may help ease digestive problems and can help if cough is caused by GERD. Chicken soup may ease symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. Chocolate. And because we saved the best for last...save some  chocolate! Theobromide, and ingredient in chocolate, may actually suppress vagus nerve activity that causes coughing."
What over-the-counter (OTC) products cure and soothe a cough?,"'There are a number of ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) cough medicines available to soothe or cure ''coughs''. There are two main types of cough medicines, 1) cough suppressants, and 2) expectorants. These can be found in tablet or cough syrup form.'   Cough suppressants, also called antitussives, block the cough reflex to relieve cough. A common OTC cough suppressant is dextromethorphan, which can be found in products such asTriaminic Cold and Cough,Robitussin Cough,Delsym, andVicks 44 Cough and Cold. Triaminic Cold and Cough, Robitussin Cough, Delsym, and Vicks 44 Cough and Cold. Expectorants work by thinning mucus. The only OTC expectorant is guaifenesin, found in products such as Mucinex and Robitussin Chest Congestion. Dextromethorphan and guaifenesin are often found in combination products, for example, combined with each other in Robitussin DM. These medications also may be combined with other medicines that help relieve other symptoms of colds such as pain relievers, decongestants, or antihistamines. If your main symptom is cough, it usually is best to avoid products that contain antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), or decongestants, such as ephedrine (Sudafed) because these have a drying effect, making mucus thicker and harder to clear from your airways, which can worsen cough symptoms. For cough due to postnasal drip, decongestants such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) or antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may improve symptoms. Cough that is a result of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may be helped byfamotidine (Pepcid),cimetidine (Tagamet),ranitidine (Zantac)omeprazole (Prilosec OTC),lansoprazole (Prevacid, Prevacid 24-Hour), andesomeprazole (Nexium). famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), ranitidine (Zantac) omeprazole (Prilosec OTC), lansoprazole (Prevacid, Prevacid 24-Hour), and esomeprazole (Nexium)."
What prescription drugs cure a cough?,"'When cough is severe, ''over-the-counter'' (OTC) medications and home remedies may not be enough to relieve symptoms, and prescriptions may be needed.''Your primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner, internal medicine specialist, or pediatrician may diagnose and treat a cough. If cough is severe an ''emergency medicine'"" specialist may see you in a hospital's emergency department."" Codeine and other narcotic medications are often prescribed as effective cough suppressants. Many times these are combined with the cough suppressant dextromethorphan, or the expectorant guaifenesin. If cough is due to whooping cough, bacterial pneumonia, complicated bronchitis, or sinusitis it is usually treated with antibiotics such as penicillin, cephalosporins, or azithromycin (Zithromax). For cough due to allergies, such as hay fever, inhaled nasal steroids may be prescribed. For postnasal drip that does not respond to OTC drugs, nasal inhalers such as ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) can help. If cough is a result of asthma, prescription inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled steroids help decrease inflammation of the airways. Short-term oral steroids, which help reduce inflammation, are sometimes prescribed to relieve chronic cough. When gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) causes a cough, prescription medications that may help symptoms include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), for exampleomeprazole (Prilosec),rabeprazole (Aciphex), andpantoprazole (Protonix). omeprazole (Prilosec), rabeprazole (Aciphex), and pantoprazole (Protonix). People suffering from chronic or persistent cough may be referred to different specialists depending on the underlying cause. If you have allergies, you may be referred to an allergist. If your cough is due to gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) you may be referred to a gastroenterologist, who specializes in diseases of the digestive tract. If you have lung disease you may need to see a pulmonologist, a lung specialist who treats diseases of the airways. If your cough is due to an underlying heart condition, you will be referred to a cardiologist, a specialist in diseases of the heart and circulatory system."
How can you get rid of a nighttime cough?,"'Many times cough symptoms will worsen at night. This may be due to postnasal drip (from a cold, ''bronchitis'', or ''allergies'') or acid from the stomach backing up into your throat from ''acid reflux''. There are some strategies and home remedies you can use to help ease nighttime cough:'   Use extra pillows for postnasal drip or if you have acid reflux to prop up the head of your bed. When you lay flat, the mucus or acid reflux irritates your throat. Raising your head allows it to drain. Take a steamy shower before bed (note: if your cough is due to asthma, steam may make it worse). Use a humidifier. Moist air can help relieve cough. However, if cough is due to allergies such as dust mites or mold, which thrive in damp air, be careful not to make the room too moist. Keep your bedding clean. If your cough is due to allergies, it is important to make sure dust mites don't have a place to sleep as well. Wash all bedding at least weekly in hot water, and dry in a dryer, not a clothesline. Drink decaffeinated tea with honey before bed. The warmth of the tea will soothe a sore throat and the fluid will help thin secretions. Herbal teas with ginger, peppermint, or licorice root may also soothe cough. Use a vapor rub, such as one with menthol, to help open airways. Keep everything you need near your bed. If you have a cough, make sure you keep your cough medicine, lozenges, a glass of water, or anything else that helps you, on your nightstand for immediate relief. Don't smoke. Avoid using perfume, air freshener sprays, or other irritants in the bedroom. Try (OTC) cough medicines that contain cough suppressants (which block the cough reflex) or expectorants (which loosen mucus). Ask your doctor or pharmacist for a recommendation."
When should you see a doctor for a cough?,"'Cough often is not serious, but in some situations you should see a doctor and not try to treat the cough on your own. If you have a cough and the following symptoms, see your doctor:''These signs and symptoms in addition to cough may indicate a more serious condition that needs treatment by a doctor.' Fever higher than 101 F/38.3 C Coughing up blood Coughing up yellow or green phlegm Shortness of breath Difficulty swallowing Loss of appetite Weight loss Excessive production of mucus Chest pain that is not a result of the cough Wheezing Fatigue Weakness Night sweats Your cough is getting worse when you should be getting better If you know you have been exposed to the flu, whooping cough, or other infections"
Facts you should know about temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome," The temporomandibular joint is the joint that connects your jaw to your skull. When this joint is injured or damaged, it can lead to a localized pain disorder called temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome or temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Causes of TMJ disorders include injury to the teeth or jaw, misalignment of the teeth or jaw, teeth grinding or clenching, poor posture, stress, arthritis, and gum chewing. Signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome includejaw pain,jaw clicking and popping,ear pain/earache,popping sounds in ears,headaches,stiff or sore jaw muscles,pain in the temple area, orlocking of the jaw joint. jaw pain, jaw clicking and popping, ear pain/earache, popping sounds in ears, headaches, stiff or sore jaw muscles, pain in the temple area, or locking of the jaw joint. TMJ disorders often responds to home remedies, including ice packs to the joint, over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), avoiding chewing gum, massage or gentle stretches of the jaw and neck, and stress reduction. When home treatment does not work, medical treatment for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome includes dental splints, Botox injections, physical therapy, prescription medications, and in severe cases, surgery. The prognosis for TMD is generally good as people usually can manage the disorder with self-care and home remedies."
What is temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome?,"'Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome is a disorder of the jaw muscles and nerves caused by injury or inflammation to the temporomandibular joint. The temporomandibular joint is the connection between the jawbone and the skull. The injured or inflamed temporomandibular joint leads to pain with chewing, clicking, crackling, and popping of the jaw; swelling on the sides of the face; nerve inflammation; ''headaches'', including ''migraines''; tooth grinding (''bruxism''); Eustachian tube dysfunction; and sometimes dislocation of the temporomandibular joint. Temporomandibular joint syndrome is also known as temporomandibular joint disorder.' "
What are the risk factors for TMJ syndrome?,'There are several risk factors for TMD:'   Poor posture in the neck and upper back muscles may lead to neck strain and abnormalities of jaw muscle function. Stress may increase muscle tension and jaw clenching. Women 18-44 years of age have increased risk. Patients with other chronic inflammatory arthritis have increased risk. People with jaw trauma or poorly positioned teeth have increased risk. People who have a genetic predisposition to pain sensitivity and increased stress responses may be more susceptible.
What causes TMJ syndrome?,"'Medical professionals do no completely understand the causes of TMD. Multiple factors contribute to the muscle tightness and dysfunction that characterize this condition. It is not clear whether some of these causes directly lead to TMJ syndrome or if they are a result of the disorder. Causes may include'   misalignment (malocclusion) of or trauma to the teeth or jaw, teeth grinding (bruxism), poor posture, stress or anxiety, arthritis and other inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders, orthodontic braces, and excessive gum chewing."
What are TMJ syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'The main TMD symptom is pain in the jaw joint. This joint is located just in front of the ear, and pain associated with TMD may involve the face, eye, forehead, ear, or neck. Signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction include the following:' 

Read Doctor's View
   Pain or tenderness in the jaw, especially at the area of the joint Popping/clicking of the jaw (crepitus) Pain that feels like a toothache Ear pain (earache) or sounds of cracking in the ears Ringing or popping sounds in the ears (tinnitus) or a sense of fullness in the ears Headaches, including migraines Blurred vision Tight, stiff, or sore jaw or neck muscles Muscle spasms in the jaw Facial pain, mouth pain, jaw pain, cheek pain, or chin numbness or tingling Pain at the base of the tongue Pain, swelling, or a lump in the temple area Difficulty chewing Shoulder pain Locking or dislocation of the jaw (usually after widely yawning), referred to as lockjaw Dizziness or vertigo"
How do health care professionals diagnose TMJ syndrome?,"""A doctor will diagnose TMD by taking the patient's medical history and doing a physical exam to find the cause of the symptoms. There is no specific test to diagnose TMD. A doctor may send the patient to an oral and maxillofacial specialist, an otolaryngologist (also called an ear, nose, and throat doctor or ENT specialist), or a dentist specializing in jaw disorders to confirm the diagnosis. Sometimes a health care professional may order an ""'MRI'' of the temporomandibular joint to detect damage to the cartilage of the jaw joint and to rule out other medical problems.''A condition that may have some similar symptoms to TMD is ''trigeminal neuralgia''. The trigeminal nerve supplies nerve impulses to the temporomandibular joint, and when irritated, it can cause facial pain. Other causes of face or ''neck pain'' include ''swollen lymph nodes'' (swollen glands), ''giant cell arteritis'', salivary gland disease, ''sore throat'', ill-fitting ''dentures'', or dental ''braces''.' "
8 Most popular treatments and 6 home remedies for TMJ pain relief,"'Many symptoms of TMJ disorders can respond well to home remedies or stress reduction and relaxation techniques. The best home remedies may provide some relief are:''When home remedies are not effective, medical treatment options may be necessary. Most of these types of treatments and remedies will not cure TMD, but they can provide temporary and even long-term relief from the pain symptoms. These most common treatments include the following:'   Ice or cold packs to the area of the joint Over-the-counter (OTC) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve), and other pain relievers, including aspirin (Ecotrin) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) Eating soft foods and avoiding chewing gum Massage or gentle self-stretching of the jaw and neck muscles (A doctor or physical therapist can recommend appropriate stretches.) Relaxation techniques and stress management and reduction Some sedative essential oils (such as lavender, chamomile, sweet marjoram, and clary sage) may provide temporary relief from the pain and discomfort of TMJ. A dental splint (occlusal splint or stabilization splint or bite guard), which is a dental appliance placed in the mouth that keeps the teeth in alignment and prevents tooth grinding. This resembles a mouth guard and is usually prescribed and fitted by a jaw specialist. A medical professional may use Botox to relax the muscles of the jaw. However, this is not currently an FDA-approved treatment for TMD. Physical therapy with jaw exercises can strengthen muscles, improve flexibility, and range of motion. In states where medical marijuana is legal, a physician may prescribe it to help with severe TMJ pain. Biobehavioral management (biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]) may help diminish pain intensity. Trigger point acupuncture can sometimes be helpful. In severe cases, surgery on the jaw or dental surgery may be necessary.TMJ arthroscopy or arthrocentesis is a minimally invasive procedure usually done in an outpatient setting. The recovery time for this procedure is about a week.Sometimes a total joint replacement may be necessary. This generally requires a stay in the hospital for several days, and surgery recovery time is four to six weeks.

Sometimes a total joint replacement may be necessary. This generally requires a stay in the hospital for several days, and surgery recovery time is four to six weeks. The following prescription-strength medicines may be used to treat TMJ:Muscle relaxants: metaxalone (Skelaxin), cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril)Anti-inflammatory drugs: nabumetone (Relafen), meloxicam (Mobic), celecoxib (Celebrex)Steroid injections: beclomethasone (Qvar)Tricyclic antidepressants: nortriptyline (Pamelor), amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep), and desipramine (Norpramin), imipramine (Norfranil, Tipramine, Tofranil)Benzodiazapines: diazepam (Valium), clonazepam (Klonopin), alprazolam (Xanax)Sleep medications: doxepin (Silenor)Nerve pain medications: gabapentin (Neurontin), topiramate (Topamax), levetiracetam (Keppra), pregabalin (Lyrica)Opiate pain medications hydrocodone and acetaminophen (Vicodin, Lortab), oxycodone and acetaminophen (Percocet) Muscle relaxants: metaxalone (Skelaxin), cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) Anti-inflammatory drugs: nabumetone (Relafen), meloxicam (Mobic), celecoxib (Celebrex) Steroid injections: beclomethasone (Qvar) Tricyclic antidepressants: nortriptyline (Pamelor), amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep), and desipramine (Norpramin), imipramine (Norfranil, Tipramine, Tofranil) Benzodiazapines: diazepam (Valium), clonazepam (Klonopin), alprazolam (Xanax) Sleep medications: doxepin (Silenor) Nerve pain medications: gabapentin (Neurontin), topiramate (Topamax), levetiracetam (Keppra), pregabalin (Lyrica) Opiate pain medications hydrocodone and acetaminophen (Vicodin, Lortab), oxycodone and acetaminophen (Percocet)"
What types of doctors treat TMJ?,"""A primary care provider (PCP), such as a family practitioner, internist, or a child's pediatrician, may first diagnose your TMJ. Your doctor may refer you to an oral and maxillofacial specialist, an otolaryngologist (also called an ear, nose, and throat doctor or ENT specialist), or a dentist specializing in jaw disorders (prosthodontist, also called a prosthetic dentist) for further treatment. You may also see a pain-management specialist if your TMJ pain is severe."" "
What is the prognosis for TMJ syndrome?,"'The prognosis for TMJ syndrome is generally good. There are numerous causes for TMJ syndrome, so the outlook depends on the cause, if known. Most people can manage the discomfort with self-care and home remedies.''Complications of long-term TMJ syndrome include chronic face pain or chronic ''headaches''. In severe situations, where pain is chronic, or associated with other inflammatory disorders, long-term treatment may be necessary.' "
Is it possible to prevent TMJ syndrome?,"'Symptoms of TMJ syndrome tend to be episodic and related to stress and lifestyle.''Prevention'' of TMJ syndrome symptoms can often be achieved using self-care at home, such as'   eating soft foods; avoiding chewing gum; maintaining proper posture; practicing stress reduction and relaxation techniques; using dental splint appliances as recommended by a jaw care professional; using proper safety equipment to prevent jaw fractures and dislocations while exercising, working, or participating in sports."
What is biological therapy?,"""Biological or biologic therapy is treatment designed to stimulate or restore the ability of the body's immune (natural internal defense) system to fight infection and disease. Biological therapy is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy and is commonly used to treat different kinds of ""'cancers'', as well as other conditions.' "
How does biological therapy work?,"""Biological therapy is a form of treatment that uses portions of the body's natural immune system to treat a disease. Biological therapy is also used to protect the body from some of the side effects of certain treatments.""'Biological therapy often involves the use of substances called biological response modifiers (BRMs). The body normally produces these substances in small amounts in response to infection and disease. Using modern laboratory techniques, scientists can produce BRMs in large amounts for use in the treatment of ''cancer'' and other diseases, such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'"" and Crohn's disease.""'Biological therapy may also target specific molecules on ''cancer'' cells to destroy the cells, or it may target proteins that facilitate the growth of ''cancer'' cells.''Depending on the agent, biological therapies can be given by mouth, intravenously, or as an injection.'  "
What are examples of biological therapies?,"'Monoclonal antibodies, ''interferon'', interleukin-2 (IL-2), and several types of colony-stimulating factors (CSF, GM- CSF, G-CSF) are forms of biological therapy. For example, interleukin-2 and interferon are two examples of BRMs being tested for the treatment of advanced ''malignant melanoma''.''Monoclonal antibodies are a common type of biological therapy for many different cancers and other conditions. These are laboratory-produced antibodies that are designed to attack specific proteins expressed by abnormal cells. Examples of monoclonal antibody ''drugs'' include ''rituximab'"", which is used to treat non-Hodgkin's ""'lymphoma'', alemtuzumab (''Campath'') to treat ''chronic lymphocytic leukemia'' (CLL), and ipilimumab (Yervoy) for metastatic ''melanoma''.''Other kinds of monoclonal antibodies used to treat cancers target proteins that are responsible for cell growth. Examples of these drugs include bevacizumab (''Avastin''), which targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix) to target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and ''trastuzumab'' (''Herceptin'') and pertuzumab (Perjeta) to target the human epidermal growth factor receptor- 2 (HER-2).''Modes of biologic therapy that involve blocking the action of specific proteins of inflammation, called ''tumor'' necrosis factor (TNF), are being used for the treatment of a number of diseases, including ''rheumatoid arthritis'"" and Crohn's disease. ""'Etanercept'' (''Enbrel'') and ''infliximab'' (''Remicade'') are examples of commercially available injectable TNF-blocking treatments for patients with severe ''rheumatoid arthritis''.''Biological therapy is a very active and exciting area of cancer research.' "
What type of specialists administer biological therapy?,"'Biological therapies are prescribed by specialists who treat cancers (oncologists or hematologist-oncologists), as well as other specialists, including ''rheumatologists'' and gastroenterologists.' "
What are the side effects of biological therapy?,"'The side effects of biological therapy depend on the type of treatment. Side effects include ''flu-like symptoms'' such as ''chills'', ''fever'', muscle aches, ''weakness'', ''loss of appetite'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''. Some patients develop a ''rash'', and some bleed or bruise easily. In addition, interleukin therapy can cause swelling.''Depending on how severe these problems are, hospitalization during treatment may be required for some patients. Side effects are usually short-term and gradually subside after treatment ends.''The long-term side effects of the various currently available biological therapies will be better defined with future research from which will also surely emerge new and valuable forms of these treatments.'  "
What is chewing tobacco?,"'Chewing tobacco is sometimes known as smokeless tobacco or spitting tobacco. It is available in two forms, snuff and chewing tobacco. Both types of chewing tobacco are held in the mouth inside the cheek or between the cheek and gum. Snuff and chewing tobacco are commonly available in tins or pouches; popular brand names include Skoal and Copenhagen. Snus (pronounced like ""snoose"") is a finely ground form of snuff that originated in Norway and Sweden that comes in small tins. The amount of snuff placed in the mouth is referred to as a pinch, dip, lipper, or quid. A portion of chewing tobacco is referred to as a plug, wad, or chew.''Chewing tobacco is known to contain at least 28 ''cancer''-causing chemicals, medically known as carcinogens. The main carcinogens in chewing tobacco are the tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs). Some of the other ''cancer''-causing agents found in chewing tobacco are formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, arsenic, benzopyrene, nickel, and cadmium. Many people mistakenly believe that snus is a safe form of chewing tobacco because it is steam-heated rather than fermented when produced in Norway or Sweden, causing it to have fewer nitrosamines. However, snus still contains a number of ''cancer''-causing chemicals. Snus made in America is not necessarily processed in the same way as in Norway or Sweden.''Nicotine is also found in snuff and chewing tobacco, like all tobacco products. Although nicotine is absorbed more slowly from chewing tobacco than from cigarettes, 3 to 4 times more nicotine is absorbed from chewing tobacco than from a ''cigarette'', and the nicotine from chewing tobacco remains longer in the bloodstream. Nicotine is the substance responsible for tobacco ''addiction''.''Chewing tobacco is not the same thing as chewing cigarettes. Chewing cigarettes (also termed ''e-cigarettes'') are designed to provide nicotine in vapor to the user without burning tobacco. However, the smokeless cigarettes still provide addictive nicotine to the user and secondhand nicotine to others.'  "
What are the health risks of chewing tobacco?,'A number of significant health risks are associated with the use of chewing tobacco.' 
Cancer risk and chewing tobacco,"'Users of snuff and chewing tobacco are at an increased risk for certain types of ''cancer'', most notably ''cancer'' of the oral ''cavity'' including ''cancers'' of the:''Some studies have suggested a link between the use of chewing tobacco and the development of:'   cheek, gums, lips, tongue, and floor and roof of the mouth. pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, and stomach cancer."
Other health risks of chewing tobacco,"'Those who use chewing tobacco have an increased risk of:''All of the above have been linked to chewing tobacco use.''Some studies have shown a link between an increased risk of ''cardiovascular disease'' (including ''heart attacks'' and ''stroke'') in users of snuff and chewing tobacco, although these risks are not as great as those observed in ''smokers''. Further research is needed to determine whether or not chewing tobacco use presents a significant risk of ''heart disease'' and ''stroke''.' developing gum diseases and gum recession (pulling away of the gum tissue from the teeth); leukoplakia (whitish patches inside the mouth that can become cancerous); abrasion (wearing down) of teeth; staining of teeth; tooth decay; and tooth loss."
Is chewing tobacco safer than cigarette smoking?,"'Chewing tobacco has been widely marketed as a way for cigarette smokers to use tobacco in smoke-free areas, so it is safer for other people because they are not exposed to ''secondhand smoke''. However, in 1986, a statement from the U.S. Surgeon General concluded that users of chewing tobacco should know that chewing tobacco ""is not a safe substitute for ''smoking'' cigarettes."" Chewing tobacco contains nicotine, which is highly addictive, as well as a number of known cancer-causing chemicals. Any form of tobacco use poses an increased risk of developing cancer, and no level is considered safe.''While the risks of getting cancer from chewing tobacco are lower than those associated with ''smoking'' cigarettes, the health risks of chewing tobacco are very real and potentially fatal. Chewing tobacco use also has not been shown to be helpful for smokers who want to ''quit smoking''.' "
What is being done to reduce the use of chewing tobacco?,"'Parents are encouraged by health care professionals, school authorities, and public health officials to include the topic of chewing tobacco use when they discuss the hazards of any tobacco use with their children, especially teenaged children. It is better never to start than try to stop the addictive tobacco (nicotine) habit in any form.''Legislation has been enacted to help reduce the number of people who use tobacco products and reduce adverse health risks associated with tobacco use. The Family ''Smoking'' ''Prevention'' and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 gives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the power to regulate tobacco products in the U.S., which will allow for increased regulation of marketing and advertising of tobacco products, including chewing tobacco.'""In 2015, San Francisco became the first U.S. city to ban the use of smokeless tobacco at sporting events, including AT&T Park, home of the city's Major League Baseball team, the Giants."" "
What treatments are available to help people quit using chewing tobacco?,"'Chewing tobacco is an ''addiction'' that can be overcome. As with ''cigarette smoking'', various support systems, programs, and even prescription medications are available to help people quit using chewing tobacco. Examples of products available used to wean a person from nicotine addiction from chewing tobacco include:''Prescription medicines such as ''bupropion'' SR (''Zyban'' and ''Wellbutrin'' SR) and ''varenicline'' tartrate (''Chantix'') have been effective in some patients who are trying to quit nicotine.'   nicotine gum (Nicorette), nicotine patches (Habitrol, Nicoderm CQ, Nicotrol), and lozenges."
How much sleep do children need?,"'Just as with adults, the amount of ''sleep'' children need varies with both age and unique needs of the individual. Below are general guidelines for children of various ages. If your child is happy and thriving, but needs more or fewer hours of ''sleep'"" than indicated below - rest assured they will remain healthy. The National Sleep Foundation's 2015 Guidelines recommend the following for sleep in children and ""'teens''.'  1 to 4 weeks old: Neonates spend approximately 65% to 75% of their daily activity in a sleep state. Waking time is of short duration and it is rare for a child of this age to have a ""day-night"" cycle. Their day-night ""clock"" is not functional until 6 to 8 weeks of age. Mothers of newborns should use their infant's sleep pattern to sleep also. 1 to 4 months old: Infants at this early age require sleep 14 to 17 hours 
of sleep per day. Many begin to develop a day-night cycle during the early weeks of this period. 
At this age, many infants have the ability to sleep evening blocks of 5 to 6 hours without interruption; however most will wake for feedings or diaper changes during the night. 4 to 12 months old: Infants in this age range require 12 to 15 hours of sleep daily. Good news for parents 
- they begin to sleep for longer continuous periods at night. Also, early in this time period, many children benefit from multiple daytime naps, though there is significant variability between different infants.  1 to 3 years old: While specialists point out that most toddlers need about 12 to 14 hours of daily sleep, many may be forced to survive on less. Daycare and erratically spaced car trips necessary for the needs of older siblings often deny or disrupt continuous sleep patterns, most often naps. 3 to 6 years old: This age range commonly needs approximately 10 to 13 hours of sleep per day with younger individuals taking a nap after lunch. Any need for napping is generally absent by the time a child enters 1st grade. 7 to 12 years old: Younger children in this age range commonly require 
9 to 11 hours of sleep each night; pre-teens often receive 9 to 10 hours (though some may require more). 12 to 18 years old: Middle and high school student lifestyle requirements (school, after school activities, dinner and finally homework) often reduce the sleep duration from the recommended 8 to 
10 hours to 6 to 8 hours. The various social network computer websites coupled with cell phone text communication 
and television viewing also may cut into a teenager's sleep time."
Can a lack of sleep impact a child's behavior?,"'The symptoms of a lack of sleep are often obvious to watchful parents. Some of these tell-tale signs include: ' recurrently falling asleep in the car (excluding young infants); requiring extreme stimulation and repetitive reminders to get up in the morning;  behavioral abnormalities such as excessive emotionalism, aggression, and crankiness; and  an older child's (over 8 years of age) recurrent need for an afternoon nap."
What is sleep hygiene?,"'A common definition of sleep hygiene is'' '' ""all behavioral and environmental factors that precede sleep and may interfere with sleep."" Daytime sleepiness and trouble sleeping may be a reflection of poor sleep hygiene. Detailed specifics are listed below. General areas to consider include: ' Personal habits: Establish consistent routines around bedtimes and awakening times  Sleep environment: The bedroom should be a slightly cooler temperature 
(between 60 F to 67 F or 15.5 C to 19.4 C), and eliminate any distracting noise in the bedroom Getting ready for bed: Establish a calming pre-sleep ritual (for example, reading, not watching TV) and  Miscellaneous: Examples include limiting intake of foods/liquids/medications which may disrupt a restful sleep"
What are some common sleep disorders in children?,"""The University of Michigan's ""'Sleep Disorders'' program includes five issues that may be disruptive of good sleep practices. These include: ' Sleep deprivation: As noted in the previously, the amount of sleep generally required varies with age and genetic predisposition. Unfortunately many older children, especially teens, do not receive an appropriate amount of sound sleep. Night waking: All children after the first 7 to 8 months of life start to be more sensitive to internal and external stimuli. If an infant has not yet learned to calm himself and resettle back to sleep, the parents commonly are summoned to help the child return to sleep. This pattern may repeat itself several times each night. Separation anxiety: Children experience this emotion commonly at 5 months of age as well as during the toddler years. Such children become anxious and are unable to enter a comfortable sleep pattern unless parents are present.  Resistance to sleep/settling problems: This occurs when your child does not want to go to bed at a reasonable time. Stalling, temper tantrums, and other resistance patterns are common. Parental persistence generally will resolve this common issue. Parasomnias: Parasomnias are problems that disrupt sleep. Examples include night terrors, grinding of teeth, sleepwalking, etc."
Sleep Apnea symptoms in children,"'Sleep apnea'' is an extremely serious sleep pathology in which the child will struggle to breath and possibly stop ''breathing'"". This process most commonly is a consequence of an enlarged tonsil and adenoid tissues that obstruct the child's upper ""'airway'"". Parents of such children will report that it sounds as if their child is being choked during sleep. Complications of sleep apnea include reduced oxygen to the brain and strain of the right side of the heart. If you believe your child may have sleep apnea, you should discuss your concerns with your child's pediatrician. An evaluation by and ENT (ears-nose-throat) specialist is often indicated. It is helpful to either audio/video record such an episode prior to such an evaluation."" "
Parasomnia symptoms in children,"'Parasomnias are disruptive sleep related events. They include several infrequent events (''periodic limb movement disorder'', ''restless leg syndrome'') and more common events (''teeth grinding'', night terrors, and ''nightmares'', sleepwalking, and ''bedwetting''). Periodic limb movement disorder occurs while asleep and is characterized by repetitive leg and (occasionally) arm movement that persist throughout the night. The child or teenager does not complain of any discomfort or abnormal sensations. In contrast, ''restless leg syndrome'' occurs while awake and affected individuals often describe a sensation of their legs ""falling asleep.""''Nightmares occur during REM (dreaming period) sleep and thus are more common later in the night. The child acts scared but may be comforted by their parents. Such children will often be able to remember their dream. Simple parental reassurance and comforting is effective. In contrast, night terrors occur in non-''REM sleep'' and thus generally within the first 4 hours of sleep. The child may become very violent with crying out in a confused manner as well as thrashing of arms and legs. Routine comforting of the child is not helpful and the child will be confused and bewildered if awakened. Generally, the child will rapidly return to a ""normal"" sleep with no memory of the events in the morning.' "
Confusional arousal symptoms in children,"'Confusional arousals are a variant of night terrors in older infants and toddlers that occur during the first half of the nighttime sleep sequence. It is felt that the child is so deeply asleep and the normal waking pattern at the end of the sleep cycle is suppressed. ''The major distinguishing point of confusional arousals versus night terrors is that the former gradually build from moaning, to crying out, and may culminate in the child standing and yelling out apparent random words or phrases. ''Conversely, night terrors tend to have an acute onset with the very rapid development of thrashing and yelling (commonly for the parents or caregivers). Confusional arousal and night terrors share several key points important for the child:' Don't try to awaken the child. They are asleep and if awakened, will have difficult time falling back to sleep. Anything that upsets the normal sleep rhythms (illness, not sleeping in their own home, and disrupted naps) may trigger either pattern."
Night terror symptoms in children,"'Night terrors are somewhat rare events that have their highest frequency in children 4 to 12 years of age. They are commonly outgrown by adulthood, though some adults manifest the same brain ''EEG'' (""brain wave"") changes during sleepwalking. ''Night terrors differ from nightmares (see previously). Night terrors manifest themselves with the person bolting upright in bed, screaming and thrashing about and stare blankly at the concerned adult who has come to investigate. They tend to occur during the first third of the child\'s sleep cycle. Children characteristically do not ""calm down"" when their parent attempts to soothe what appears to be a fearful experience. EEG studies demonstrate that the child is not awake (i.e. he/she is asleep), and if awakened, has no knowledge or memory of the immediately preceding events. The duration of night terror episodes is short lived. Some authorities believe that night terrors may be a response to sleep deprivation, ''stress'', ''fever'', or ''fatigue''.' "
Narcolepsy symptoms in children,"'Narcolepsy'' is more common in adults than children. It has been defined as ""a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep. Narcolepsy is a chronic condition for which there is no cure."" Research has shown that narcolepsy is not a type of ''seizure'', ''fainting'' episode, or psychological illness. Symptoms of narcolepsy include:' Excessive daytime sleepiness: affected individuals have an uncontrollable need to sleep during the day; Sudden loss of muscle tone (Cataplexy): this may range from slurred speech to total collapse of all voluntary muscles. Emotional stimulation (often positive by nature, for example, laughter) may trigger such an attack; Sleep paralysis: Characterized by a temporary (1-2 minutes) period of the inability to speak or move when falling asleep or waking; Vivid or frightening hallucinations which occur most commonly during REM (dreaming) sleep."
Sleepwalking symptoms in children,"'The onset of sleepwalking (somnambulism) typically presents in prepubertal children most frequently at age 11 to 12, and occurs more often in boys than girls. The overall incidence of sleepwalking is approximately 18%. Like night terrors, the individual is difficult to arouse during the event and does not remember the experience. Sleepwalking most commonly occurs during the first third of the sleep cycle. Some sleepwalkers may also mumble during sleepwalking episodes and occasionally obscene words may be uttered. Medications are rarely necessary to manage sleepwalking episodes. Ensuring a safe environment (protection against falls or ''walking'' out of the house) and maintenance of good sleep habits (avoiding sleep deprivation) are important considerations to prevent sleepwalking.' "
Do teenagers have the same sleep requirements as younger children?,"'Most teens need about 8 to 10 hours of sleep per day. Some studies have indicated that they have a different internal ""sleep clock"" than those younger or older than them. Researchers have demonstrated that teens are truly ""night owls,"" and if left to their own devices, would spontaneously wake from a good night\'s sleep anywhere from 9:00 am to 10:00 am. High school teachers who have classes before this time period have empiric experience to second this observation. Younger children may need anywhere from 12-15 hours (infant: 2 naps plus nighttime long block) to 9-11 hours (middle school child). ' "
How can I teach my child or teenager healthy sleep habits and good sleep hygiene?,"'Primary to establishing good sleep habits is a realization that sleep is a normal and necessary function. However, just as with other normal and necessary functions (for example, eating, toilet training, etc.), a battle may develop between parents and their child in this area. ''All children older than 5 to 6 months of age need to master the ability to self-soothe and relax in order to successfully fall asleep. Depriving them of this skill by either feeding or rocking them to sleep, reading until the child falls asleep, or lying down with the child in order to facilitate falling asleep, is a recipe for frustration - both for the child and the parent. ''Tired children (of any age) intuitively know when they are tired and, if provided the proper environment, will easily and quickly fall asleep. ''When they awaken during the middle of the night they are capable of falling back to sleep without parental intervention. In this circumstance, both child and parents awake refreshed the next morning.' "
What are some ways I can help my child or teenager get a better night's sleep?,"'These ""do\'s"" are adapted from ""''Sleep Problems'': Your Child"" University of Michigan Health Care System and ""Healthy Sleep Tips"" from the National Sleep Foundation.'  Make bedtime a special time. Create special soothing and calming experiences with the opportunity for special ""talks"" or sharing experiences that foster comfort for both child and parent. Study your child so you can determine when he is ready to sleep. Once this is determined you can start the ""get ready for bed"" routine with enough time in advance so the child doesn't get a ""second wind"". Keep the bedtime routine consistent and simple. Mental and physical stimulation is counter productive. Dim lights starting about 10 – 15 minutes before going to sleep.  Bright lights act as a stimulant to the child's brain.   Keep the bedtime routine portable. For example, it can occur whether at home or outside of the home (for example, in a motel during vacation). Make sure your child is both mentally and physically tired at the end of the day. Children need between 30 to 60 minutes per day of vigorous playtime (depending on the age). Besides fostering good sleep habits, such a program will help maintain optimum weight gain. Establish a restful atmosphere. Keep the lights dim, limit noise and electronic devices. Teens should turn off computers/TV's and cell phones when retiring to bed. 
The bedroom temperature should be between 60 F and 67 F or 15.5 C to 19.4 C. Avoid afternoon naps in children over 6 years of age."
"What are some ""don'ts"" for getting my child or teen to sleep?","'These ""don\'ts"" are adapted from ""Sleep Problems: Your Child"" University of Michigan Health Care System.' Don't put your child to bed with a bottle of juice, milk or formula. Sugar in such drinks promotes tooth decay. Water is acceptable. Don't fill up the bed with toys. Limit the crib/bed to one to two ""special"" items. Too many items are over stimulating and the child will have a hard time not playing with them. Eliminate any object that might be a safety hazard. Don't threaten to send your child to bed as a punishment. Bedtime should be an enjoyable experience that will promote falling asleep in a timely fashion. Avoid caffeine before bed: Caffeinated drinks such as cola, chocolate, iced tea, 
energy drinks, etc. Limit TV in the afternoon and at night. TV stimulation may carry on longer than you suspect. Having a TV in a child's room may be counterproductive to getting your child or teen to sleep. A 2014 National Sleep Foundation study indicates that 72% of children 6 years old to 17 years old have at least one electronic device in their bedroom.  These children may get up to one hour less sleep per night as their peers without such devices in the bedroom."
What is a broken toe?,'A commonly injured area of the foot is the small bones of the toes (phalanges). There are 26 bones in the foot; 19 are bones in the forefoot (five ''metatarsals'' and 14 phalanges). Trauma and the injury to the foot often causes one or more of the toe bones to break (fracture).' 
What are the symptoms of a broken toe?,"   Pain, swelling, or stiffness will occur in a broken toe following injury. It may be difficult to walk due to the pain, especially with a broken big toe. This is because the big toe bears much of the weight of the body during walking or pivoting. A broken little toe (pinky toe) may be painful, but usually does not limit the ability to walk. Other symptoms includea bruised toe,bruising of the skin aroundthe toe, anda bent or deformed appear-ance of the toe if the brokenbone is out of place. a bruised toe, bruising of the skin aroundthe toe, and a bent or deformed appear-ance of the toe if the brokenbone is out of place. Other problems may develop as a result of the fractured toe. Complications can occur immediately after the injury (minutes to days), or can develop much later (weeks to years). People with weakened bones"
What are the causes of a broken toe?,"'Trauma or injury such as stubbing the toe (jammed toe) or dropping a heavy object on the toe may cause a broken toe. The location of the toes (at the front part of the ''feet'') makes them the most likely part of the foot to be injured.''Prolonged repetitive movements, as in certain sports activities, can cause a type of broken type of broken toe called a ''stress fracture'' or hairline fracture. People with weakened bones (''osteoporosis'' or other disorders) may develop ''stress'' fractures simply from wearing improper shoes.' "
When to call a doctor if I think you have a broken toe,"'Many people think that if they can walk on an injured toe, it is not broken. This may not be the case. It is common to break a toe bone and still be able to walk on it.'""Go to a hospital's emergency department if you have following signs or symptoms.""'Call a doctor if any of the following occur:'   Any symptoms of a possible open (compound) fracture which include open wounds, bleeding, or drainage from near the broken toe Cold, numb, tingling, or unusual sensation in the toes Blue or gray colored skin near the injury If the injured toe appears deformed or is pointing in the wrong direction (angulated) If the broken toe pain worsens or new pain is not relieved by pain medication Sores, redness, or open wounds near the injured toe Bruising or bleeding under the toenail that causes significant pain A cast or splint is damaged or broken"
How can you tell if you have a broken toe?,"'Seek medical evaluation soon after the injury to ensure proper treatment and healing.''You initially may see a primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner or a child’s pediatrician when you first injure your toe. You likely will be referred to an orthopedist or orthopedic surgeon, who specializes in disorders of the musculoskelteal system, or a podiatrist, a specialist in conditions of the foot, for treatment.'""You also may be diagnosed with a broken toe in a hospital's emergency department by an ""'emergency medicine'' specialist. Radiologists will read an X-ray or MRI, though they will usually report back to your primary care physician or emergency medicine specialist and you will not directly consult with them.'   A doctor will ask questions to determine how the toe was injured and will examine the injured toe and possibly check for other injuries (for example, sprains). A doctor may take an X-ray to evaluate if the toe is broken or fractured. X-rays are not always necessary to diagnose a broken toe, especially if the break is in one of the smaller toes. Stress fractures, due to overuse or repetitive movement, may need an MRI to be diagnosed."
Can anything be done at home for a broken toe?,"'Most minor toe injuries can be treated at home. If a you are unsure or suspect a fracture, seek medical attention. The following self-care tips may help decrease pain and swelling from a broken toe, and to help the fracture heal properly.''In certain situations, a broken toe may need medical care such as maneuvering the toe back into place (reduction), casting, or splinting the toe.'   Rest: Avoid strenuous exercise, prolonged standing, or walking. Crutches may be needed, or a special shoe or boot to wear when walking to avoid putting weight on the fracture while it heals. Ice: Put ice in a plastic bag and apply it to the injury for 15-20 minutes every one to two hours for the first few days. Place a towel between the skin and the ice to protect the skin. Frozen peas or corn can also be used to ice the broken toe - they may conform to the fractured area better than ice. Elevation: To decrease swelling and pain, keep the foot raised above the level of the heart as much and as often as possible. Prop the foot up as much as possible (for example use several pillows), especially when sleeping. Reclining in a lounge chair is also helpful."
How to buddy tape a broken toe,"'If there is a minor or small fracture in a bone of one of the small toes, a doctor may only need to tape the injured toe to the one next to it for support. This treatment is called buddy taping.'""If the toe is buddy taped, it is usually safe to bathe, and then replace the tape afterward, however, check with the doctor prior to removing the tape to bathe. Always follow your doctor's instructions on how to tape your broken toe."" Put a small piece of cotton or gauze between the toes that are taped together. (This prevents the skin between the toes from developing sores or blisters.) Using as little tape as necessary, loosely tape the broken toe to the toe next to it. If the toes are taped too tightly it can cause additional swelling and may cut off circulation to the injured toe."
What is the medical treatment for a broken toe?,"'Depending on the location and severity of the toe fracture, the fracture may need to be put back into place (reduced) and splinted or casted. Because it has a significant weight bearing role, fractures of the big toe are often more serious and more likely to require reduction or surgical treatment. If there is an ''open wound'' near the injured toe, a ''tetanus'' shot and antibiotic medication may also be necessary.''If there is an open (compound) fracture of the toe, surgery may be necessary in some cases, and antibiotics will be given. This type of fracture should be seen by a doctor immediately.''Usually only anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' like ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') or ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'') are needed for pain. For severe injuries, the doctor may prescribe a stronger pain medicine.' "
Casting a broken toe," A cast usually is not required for a simple toe fracture. A hard-soled, sturdy, and supportive shoe or boot should be worn. A doctor may give the patient a special shoe to wear if the foot or toes are very swollen. A cast (or surgery) may be needed if the big toe is broken, a fracture involves a joint, several small toe fractures occur at once, or if a bone in the foot or leg is broken in addition to the toe."
Reduction for a broken toe," If the toe fracture is displaced (the two ends of the broken toe bone are out of place) or rotated (the toe is pointing in the wrong direction), or the toe is dislocated, the doctor may need to reduce it, or set the broken toe back into place. Sometimes local anesthesia may be needed to numb the toe before it is put back into place. After a reduction, a splint will be applied to the broken toe to hold it in place while it heals."
How long does it take for a broken toe to heal?,"'Talk to the doctor to have the broken toe evaluated to be certain it is healing properly. Call a doctor or go to an emergency department if any problems or complications develop before the scheduled appointment.''The healing time for broken toes usually is take about six weeks to heal. If problems last longer than six weeks, another X-ray may be needed, or the injury should be rechecked by the doctor to evaluate how the bone is healing. Simple toe fractures usually heal well with no problems. However, a severe fracture or a fracture that goes into a joint is at risk for developing arthritis, pain, stiffness, and possibly even a deformity.' "
What are the possible complications of a broken toe?,"'Other problems may develop as a result of the broken toe. Complications can occur immediately after the injury (minutes to days), or can develop much later (weeks to years). Inadequate treatment of a broken toe may lead to complications including foot deformities and ''chronic pain''. Even when a broken toe is treated promptly, complications may arise including:' Nail injury: A collection of blood may develop underneath the toenail called a subungual hematoma. If it is large, it may need to be drained. To drain a subungual hematoma a doctor will make a small hole in the toenail to drain the blood. If the hematoma is very large or painful, the entire toenail may need to be removed. The injury may also result in a broken toenail that may need to be trimmed or removed. Compound fracture: Rarely, the broken bone in a toe fracture may stick out through the skin. This is called an open or compound fracture. Emergency medical treatment and surgery may be necessary. Arthritis: After the toe fracture heals, the person may still be left with arthritis, pain, stiffness, or even deformity. Nonunion/malunion: Sometimes, the fractured bone will not heal completely (called a nonunion) or will heal improperly (called a malunion). Rarely, surgery may be necessary to fix this problem."

What are urinary incontinence pads and other absorbent products?,"'Incontinence pads and other absorbent products.'"" While women grow up using pads (albeit of a different sort), men can find the idea pretty weird and distressing. But these incontinence products can be enormously helpful. They can prevent leaking onto your clothes, control odor, and prevent skin irritation.

What are urinary incontinence external catheters?,"'External catheters.'"" Unlike the catheters used at the hospital, external catheters for male incontinence are silicone or latex devices that go over the penis instead of into the urethra. They're usually rolled on like ""'condoms'"". The urine is sent through a tube into a drainage bag. Some men only use these devices at night. To prevent leaks, it's very important to get the right fit and to follow the instructions from the manufacturer."" "
What are urinary incontinence drainage bags?,"'Drainage bags.'' These are just the ''plastic'' bags that you would attach to a catheter. Larger ones are called ""bedside bags"" and are hung near the bed. Smaller ones can be worn on the body, attached to the abdomen or leg with straps. ' "
What are urinary incontinence underpads?,'Underpads.'' These incontinence products are basic waterproof pads or covers that can be placed on furniture or mattresses to protect against leaks. They add an extra level of protection. '

What is the history of Tommy John surgery?,"'Dr. Frank Jobe first performed surgery to graft and repair the ulnar collateral ligament in the elbow on Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Tommy John in 1974. After a year of rehabilitation, John returned to pitching in the Major Leagues and won more games after his surgery than beforehand.'""The UCL injury had been career ending for pitchers at all levels of competition, but after the success Dr. Jobe's operation, the procedure's use was refined and is now commonly performed."" "
What causes an ulnar collateral ligament injury (UCL injury)?,"'The ulnar collateral ligament is the major stabilizer of the elbow. Damage to the ligament is due to overuse, most often because of throwing and is often associated with baseball pitching and other throwing sports. The ligament may fray, tear, or gradually become loose, causing the elbow to become painful and unstable.''On occasion, a fall on an outstretched hand can tear the UCL in the elbow.' "
What are signs and symptoms of a UCL injury?,"'Symptoms of UCL injury tend to be chronic, presenting with medial ''elbow pain'', especially with an overhead throwing motion. ''Pain'' tends to get better with rest but recurs with activity. The ''pain'' causes decreased throwing ability and decreased velocity or speed.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose a UCL injury?,"'Physicians suspect UCL injury based on history and physical exam.''There will be tenderness, with or without swelling, along the inside part of the elbow just above the epicondyle, where the UCL inserts. When the joint is stretched, ''pain'' may be worse. Pain increases when the patient clenches a fist.''Imaging''An orthopedic surgeon may perform ''arthroscopy'' to directly evaluate the UCL and the elbow joint.' Plain X-ray may be useful in looking for bony injuries that can mimic UCL tears, including avulsion fractures, where the ligament pulls away a piece of bone. Ultrasound may assess the ulnar collateral ligament looking for a tear. MR arthrography is often the test of choice to assess the ligament and any other abnormalities in the elbow joint. A health care professional injects dye into the joint and then performs an MRI. It can determine both partial and complete tears of the UCL."
What types of doctors diagnose and treat a UCL injury?,"'Though a variety of doctors, from primary care providers to sports medicine specialists, may make the diagnosis of UCL instability or tear, the diagnosis and treatment usually requires consultation with an orthopedic doctor who usually specializes in sports and upper extremity injuries.' "
Who is a candidate for Tommy John surgery?,"'Health care professionals usually recommend surgery for competitive athletes who want to return to play, if there is chronic instability of the elbow joint, or if ''chronic pain'' persists. Often, health care professionals only recommend surgery after conservative treatment with physical therapy has failed.' "
What happens during the Tommy John surgical procedure?,"'Tommy John surgery does not repair the ulnar collateral ligament but instead replaces it with a graft from another ligament in the body or from a cadaver donor. Many times, physicians relocate the ulnar nerve that runs nearby to prevent its inflammation.' "
What is the recovery time after Tommy John surgery?,"'Recovery after surgery requires patience. The goal is to be able to return to throwing at a competitive level within a year.'""The following is an example of a rehabilitation program. Doctors will individualize the specific regimen for the patient's specific situation:""  0-2 weeks: elbow is kept in a splint 0-4 weeks: hinged brace is sued to promote gradual increase in range of motion 4-8 weeks: isometric exercises for strengthening 8 weeks-plus: increased strengthening exercises 12weeks-plus: plyometric exercises 4-6 months: throwing exercises 9-12 months: return to competition"
What is a CT scan?,"'Computerized (or computed) tomography,  and often formerly referred to as computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan, is an X-ray procedure that combines many X-ray images with the aid of a computer to generate cross-sectional views and, if needed, three-dimensional images of the internal organs and structures of the body. Computerized tomography is more commonly known by its abbreviated names, CT scan or CAT scan. A CT scan is used to define normal and abnormal structures in the body and/or assist in procedures by helping to accurately guide the placement of instruments or treatments.''A large donut-shaped X-ray machine or scanner takes X-ray images at many different angles around the body. These images are processed by a computer to produce cross-sectional pictures of the body. In each of these pictures the body is seen as an X-ray ""slice"" of the body, which is recorded on a film. This recorded image is called a tomogram. ""Computerized axial tomography"" refers to the recorded tomogram ""sections"" at different levels of the body.''Imagine the body as a loaf of bread and you are looking at one end of the loaf. As you remove each slice of bread, you can see the entire surface of that slice from the crust to the center. The body is seen on CT scan slices in a similar fashion from the skin to the central part of the body being examined. When these levels are further ""added"" together, a three-dimensional picture of an organ or abnormal body structure can be obtained. '  "
Why are CT scans performed?,"'CT scans are performed to analyze the internal structures of various parts of the body. This includes the head, where traumatic injuries, (such as ''blood clots'' or skull ''fractures''), tumors, and infections can be identified. In the spine, the bony structure of the vertebrae can be accurately defined, as can the anatomy of the intervertebral discs and spinal cord. In fact, CT scan methods can be used to accurately measure the density of bone in evaluating ''osteoporosis''.''Occasionally, contrast material (an X-ray dye) is placed into the spinal fluid to further enhance the scan and the various structural relationships of the spine, the spinal cord, and its nerves. Contrast material is also often administered intravenously or through other routes prior to obtaining a CT scan (see below). CT scans are also used in the chest to identify tumors, ''cysts'', or infections that may be suspected on a ''chest X-ray''. CT scans of the abdomen are extremely helpful in defining body organ anatomy, including visualizing the ''liver'', gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, ''aorta'', kidneys, uterus, and ovaries. CT scans in this area are used to verify the presence or absence of tumors, infection, abnormal anatomy, or changes of the body caused by ''trauma''.''The technique is painless and can provide extremely accurate images of body structures in addition to guiding the radiologist in performing certain procedures, such as biopsies of suspected ''cancers'', removal of internal body fluids for various tests, and the draining of abscesses which are deep in the body. Many of these procedures are minimally invasive and have markedly decreased the need to perform surgery to accomplish the same goal. '  "
Are there risks in obtaining a CT scan?,"'A CT scan is a very low-risk procedure. The most common problem is an adverse reaction to intravenous contrast material. Intravenous contrast is usually an iodine-based liquid given in the vein, which makes many organs and structures, such as the kidneys and blood vessels, much more visible on the CT scan. There may be resulting ''itching'', a ''rash'', ''hives'', or a feeling of warmth throughout the body. These are usually self-limiting reactions that go away rather quickly. If needed, ''antihistamines'' can be given to help relieve the symptoms. A more serious ''allergic reaction'' to intravenous contrast is called an anaphylactic reaction. When this occurs, the patient may experience severe hives and/or extreme difficulty in ''breathing''. This reaction is quite rare, but is potentially life-threatening if not treated. Medications which may include ''corticosteroids'', antihistamines, and epinephrine can reverse this adverse reaction.''Toxicity to the kidneys which can result in ''kidney failure'' is an extremely rare complication of the intravenous contrast material used in CT scans. People with ''diabetes'', people who are dehydrated, or patients who already have impaired kidney function are most prone to this reaction. Newer intravenous contrast agents have been developed, such as Isovue, which have nearly eliminated this complication.''The amount of ''radiation'' a person receives during a CT scan is minimal. In men and nonpregnant women, it has not been shown to produce any adverse effects. If a woman is ''pregnant'', there may be a potential risk to the fetus, especially in the ''first trimester'' of the ''pregnancy''. If a woman is pregnant, she should inform her doctor of her condition and discuss other potential methods of imaging, such as an ''ultrasound'"", which are not harmful to the fetus. However, the radiation exposure during a CT scan may cause a very small increase in a person's lifetime risk of developing ""'cancer''. This concern is often viewed as more important for children, because the ''cancer'' risk per dose of radiation is higher for younger patients than adults, and younger patients have a ''longer life'' expectancy. Still, the risks of exposure to radiation must be weighed against the benefits of using CT scanning to diagnose or treat illness. CT scanners can be modified to deliver exposures that are more appropriate for pediatric patients. Most physicians suggest that all radiation exposure to patients should be kept to a minimum; those patients that ""doctor shop"" or repeatedly go to emergency departments for a ""CT” put themselves at risk for radiation-caused problems.' "
"How does a patient prepare for CT scanning, and how is it performed?","'In preparation for a CT scan, patients are often asked to avoid food, especially when contrast material is to be used. Contrast material may be injected intravenously, or administered by mouth or by an enema in order to increase the distinction between various organs or areas of the body. Therefore, fluids and food may be restricted for several hours prior to the examination. If the patient has a history of ''allergy'' to contrast material (such as iodine), the requesting physician and radiology staff should be notified. All metallic materials and certain clothing around the body are removed because they can interfere with the clarity of the images.''Patients are placed on a movable table, and the table is slipped into the center of a large donut-shaped machine which takes the X-ray images around the body. The actual procedure can take from half an hour to an hour and a half. If specific tests, biopsies, or interventions are performed by the radiologist during CT scanning, additional time and monitoring may be required. It is important during the CT scan procedure that the patient minimizes any body movement by remaining as still and quiet as is possible. This significantly increases the clarity of the X-ray images. The CT scan technologist tells the patient when to breathe or hold his/her breath during scans of the chest and abdomen. If any problems are experienced during the CT scan, the technologist should be informed immediately. The technologist directly watches the patient through an observation window during the procedure, and there is an intercom system in the room for added patient safety.''CT scans have vastly improved the ability of doctors to diagnose many diseases earlier in their course and with much less risk than previous methods. Further refinements in CT scan technology continue to evolve which promise even better picture quality and patient safety. CT scans known as ""spiral"" or ""helical"" CT scans can provide more rapid and accurate visualization of internal organs. For example, many trauma centers are using these scans to more rapidly diagnose internal injuries after serious body trauma. High resolution CT scans (HRCT) are used to accurately assess the ''lungs'' for inflammation and scarring. CT ''angiography'' is a newer technique that allows noninvasive imaging of the coronary arteries. Note that some CT scanners may not be able to accommodate patients that weigh over 400 pounds.' "

What causes tongue problems?,"'There are many possible causes of tongue problems, ranging from harmless to serious. Individuals can be born with a tongue condition that is harmless. A more serious condition such as ''tongue cancer'' can be related to risk factors such as ''smoking'' and drinking ''alcohol''. Additionally, a tongue problem may be a result of an underlying medical condition.' "

Otherwise, the following are some common causes of white tongue: ''oral thrush'', ''leukoplakia'', oral ''lichen planus'', hairy leukoplakia, and linea alba.''Oral ''thrush'' (or ''candidiasis'') is caused by an overgrowth of yeast fungus in the mouth. The white patches can be scraped off to expose a red surface on the tongue. Illnesses, medications, ''stress'', and antibiotic treatment can cause oral ''thrush'' by throwing off the balance of natural bacteria in the mouth. Those with ''diabetes'' are more prone to ''fungal infections'', such as oral thrush. Lozenges, tablets, or liquid antifungals are used for treatment.''Leukoplakia is characterized by white patches that cannot be scraped off and may be related to chronic irritation in the mouth, although the cause is not always known. Tobacco use is the most common factor that contributes to leukoplakia. The condition may resolve after ''smoking cessation''. Sometimes the patches are on the sides of the tongue and could be related to constant rubbing next to the lower ''teeth''. Although leukoplakia is usually benign, it can also be the precursor to ''oral cancer''. The risk of ''cancer'' increases with the age of the individual, size of the lesion, and number of lesions present. A biopsy may be recommended after clinical evaluation by the doctor. Sometimes, the area can be monitored for changes by the doctor. Monitoring is usually performed during routine dental visits or during visits with an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist.''Oral ''lichen planus'"" on the tongue is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by an autoimmune response (the body's immune system attacking its own tissue). It is characterized by a white lace-like pattern called reticular lichen planus. (There is an erosive form that presents as shallow ""'mouth ulcers'' and can be treated with topical steroids.) Regular monitoring of this condition is recommended for any changes that (although rare) could lead to ''oral cancer''. A biopsy may be recommended.''Hairy leukoplakia is a white patch on the side of the tongue that appears hairy or rough. This condition is caused by the ''Epstein-Barr virus'' and is usually related to immunocompromised individuals. ''HIV testing'' should be considered if hairy leukoplakia appears without a known immune-compromising condition. Antiviral medications such as ''acyclovir'' (''Zovirax'') may be used. Recurrence of hairy leukoplakia is common.''Linea alba is a benign condition that is characterized by a thin white line at the lateral (side) borders of the tongue. It is caused by the thickening of the epithelium due to ''trauma'' or irritation from chewing. No treatment is necessary for linea alba.'  "
Red tongue,"'There are obvious causes of red color change of the tongue, such as something you ate (strawberries or red-colored foods). Some acidic foods can cause temporary redness and discomfort. However, a raspberry-colored tongue can be a sign of an underlying medical condition. Some red color changes on the tongue (""strawberry tongue"") could be related to a vitamin deficiency, ''Kawasaki disease'', or a ''strep'' infection (''scarlet fever'').''Erythroplakia is a red area or lesion that cannot be rubbed off on the tongue (except for the color, it is similar to leukoplakia). A lesion with a combined white and red appearance is called erythroleukoplakia. These lesions are all considered to have ''premalignant'' potential. Erythroplakia and erythroleukoplakia have an increased risk of premalignancy compared to leukoplakia. In addition to appearance, there is concern if the lesion or sore does not go away or grows in size. A biopsy is recommended by an ''oral surgeon'' or an ENT specialist to rule out oral ''cancer''.' "
Black tongue,"'A black tongue is usually a harmless condition that can be caused by medications, ''smoking'', poor oral hygiene, soft ''diet'', or ''dry mouth''. A black tongue is usually associated with elongated tongue papillae and thus, it is called ""black ''hairy tongue''"" (lingua villosa nigra). The cause is thought to be a change in the normal bacteria in the mouth after antibiotic treatment or use of products that contain bismuth such as ''Pepto-Bismol''. (""Hairy tongue"" by itself can also be white or tan.) Treatment of black hairy tongue may involve improving one\'s ''diet'', smoking cessation, and improved oral hygiene (including gently brushing with a soft-bristled ''toothbrush'' or scraping the tongue).'  "
Increased size or tongue swelling,"'Swelling or enlargement of the tongue, referred to as macroglossia, can be caused by ''allergies'', medications, injuries, or an underlying medical condition such as ''amyloidosis''. Addressing the underlying condition is the usual treatment for macroglossia.''Allergic reaction'' to medications, food, or even a ''bee sting'' can cause swelling of the tongue. In the case of sudden and rapid onset of swelling of the tongue, one should seek emergency care as ''breathing'' can become compromised.''Tongue swelling can also be a side effect of medication. Some medications that have this side effect are ''ACE inhibitors'' (to treat ''high blood pressure'') and ''NSAIDs'' (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'') such as ''Aleve'', ''Advil'', and ''aspirin''.''An injury from hot food or liquid that ''burns'' the tongue or simply biting the tongue can irritate the tongue to cause swelling.''Conditions such as oral thrush or oral ''herpes'' ''viruses'' can cause the tongue to swell due to inflammation. Other medical conditions include tumorous ''cancer'', acromegaly (giantism), amyloidosis, ''sarcoidosis'', ''hypothyroidism'', and Kawasaki disease. Tongue swelling can also be found in individuals with ''Down syndrome''.' "
"Growths 
on the tongue","'Traumatic fibroma is commonly found on the tongue and appears as a raised, thickened nodule that is dome-shaped, pink, and smooth. It is the result of chronic irritation of one area of the tongue, particularly along the bite line of the tongue. It is considered benign. An excisional biopsy is usually performed to definitively diagnose the lesion and completely excise it from the tongue.''Previously mentioned colored lesions, leukoplakia (white), erythroplakia (red), and erythroleukoplakia (red-white), are also classified as growths of the tongue. In most instances, biopsy is recommended for these lesions to rule out premalignancy.''Squamous cell carcinoma'' (SCC) is the most common cancer related to the oral ''cavity'', making up 90% of all ''oral cancers''. Oral cancer makes up approximately 2% of all ''cancers'' in the U.S. It commonly involves the lateral surface of the tongue. Risk factors for SCC are older age (age 40 and up), tobacco use, and alcohol use. In younger individuals, cases of SCC often are associated with ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV''). In recent years, ''HPV'' has been found to contribute more to the incidence rate of oral cancers. SCC clinically presents as a thickened rough surface over a red or white base. Nodules and ulcerations may follow as the growth progresses. In some cases, the ''tumor'' will be present at the base of the tongue and will be difficult to detect until it reaches its late stage of development. Treatment for SCC involves a mix of surgical removal, ''chemotherapy'', and/or ''radiation therapy''. Immunotherapy and gene therapy are examples of newer treatments being investigated. ''Clinical trials'' of new treatment may be a possible option for advanced cancers. Each individual should understand the nature of the cancer and options available for treatment in order to make the best decisions.'  "
Abnormalities of the tongue surface,"'Smooth areas of the tongue may be related to injury (food ''burn'') or a nutritional deficiency of iron, folate, or vitamin B12. A smooth tongue can also result from the use of ''dentures''.''""''Geographic tongue''"" (or benign migratory glossitis) is the most common tongue condition. It is found in up to 14% of the U.S. population. It is a benign condition that appears as bare or smooth areas on the dorsum of the tongue. It may be one area or several areas and may even vary from time to time. It is usually painless; however, the smooth areas may have sensitivity to spicy or acidic foods for some individuals. No treatment is recommended.''Fissured tongue is the second most common tongue condition and is characterized by a deepening of normal tongue fissures and is usually associated with ''aging'"". Some medical conditions are linked to fissured tongue and include Sjögren's syndrome, ""'psoriasis'', ''Down syndrome'"", and acromegaly. No treatment is required unless food debris and bacteria get trapped and cause inflammation of the tongue's papillae. Gentle brushing should alleviate the problem.""""As previously mentioned, hairy tongue is the hypergrowth of the tongue's papillae and is usually associated with white, tan, or black discoloration. Hairy tongue is the third most common tongue condition and is considered harmless. Gentle brushing or scraping of the tongue may be helpful. No other treatment is necessary.""'Median rhomboid glossitis is a lesion at the midline of the dorsum of the tongue. It usually looks like a smooth, red, shiny, and sharply defined area. The underlying cause is usually a fungal infection. Treatment options include topical oral antifungal agents such as ''nystatin'' (''Mycostatin'') or ''fluconazole'' (''Diflucan'').' "
Tongue pain,"'Pain'' with the tongue can be associated with ''anemia'', ''canker sores'' (aphthous ulcers), oral herpes, neuralgia, cancer, poorly fitting ''dentures'', or irritation from dental work.''Canker sores'' are commonly found on the tongue and can be very painful. They appear as a yellow-white center with a red halo. These ulcerations are thought to be caused by local injury, stress, or genetic predisposition; however, no definitive cause has been found. No treatment is usually necessary as these ulcerations generally resolve in less than two weeks.'""Oral herpes is caused by the herpes virus and appears as fluid-filled lesions. These lesions usually resolve in two weeks' time, but oral herpes can also be treated with antiviral medications such as acyclovir (Zovirax) to shorten the duration of symptoms.""'""''Burning mouth syndrome''"" is a phenomenon that often includes the tongue (often called ""burning tongue""). Other symptoms include increased ''thirst'' with the feeling of a ''dry mouth'', as well as an altered or ''metallic taste''. It has been associated with other conditions that include ''menopause'', ''anxiety'', ''depression'', ''acid reflux'', nutritional deficiencies, and mouth conditions such as ''dry mouth'' or oral thrush. Treatment is usually for the underlying condition (for example antifungals for oral thrush, supplement for ''nutrition'' deficiencies, or medications to treat ''anxiety'' or ''depression'').' "
Altered sensation of the tongue,"'Paresthesia is an abnormal or altered sensation. Paresthesia of the tongue can occur with damage to the lingual nerve, the nerve of sensation for the tongue. The most common cause of lingual nerve damage occurs during ''wisdom teeth'' extractions where the nerve is very close to the tooth being extracted. The nerve damage is usually noticed well after the procedure and symptoms include altered, decreased, or complete loss of sensation. Senses of pain, taste, touch, perception of temperature and perception of relative position and movement (proprioception) may be affected. The sensation of ""pins and needles"" similar to being numb during a dental procedure may persist. Usually, treatment involves waiting for the nerve to self-repair itself in a period of six months to a year. If there is no improvement, surgery may be an option to repair the injured nerve.' "
Taste problems,"'Dysgeusia'' is the term used to describe the distortion of the sense of taste. Common causes of dysgeusia include medications, cancer therapy, dry mouth, ''gum disease'', and the ''common cold'' or ''flu''. Cancer therapy that involves chemotherapy and ''radiation'' to the head and neck area can greatly affect taste. Radiation therapy can damage taste buds and salivary glands. Decreased flow of saliva causes a dry mouth and further compounds the problem. ''Cigarette smoking'' also can affect taste. Dysgeusia can be a temporary condition and should resolve once the cause is eliminated. Damage to taste buds through radiation therapy may require time for healing to occur. Taste may slowly return and greatly depends on the amount of damage from radiation therapy. Artificial saliva and zinc supplementation may help in restoring taste for some individuals. A lack of taste sensation (ageusia) is rare.' "
Problems with tongue movement,"'Tongue movement problems are often caused by nerve damage (for example, post-''stroke'' or post-surgery nerve damage). Limited tongue mobility can greatly affect our eating, swallowing, and speech. Depending on the extent of nerve damage, sometimes physical therapy may help in regaining control of the tongue.''Ankyloglossia, also known as ""tongue-tie,"" is a less common condition where a band of tissue that connects the tongue to the floor of the mouth is too short or tight and impedes tongue movement. Because the tongue is vital for sucking, infants with ankyloglossia may be unable to breastfeed properly. For toddlers and older children, sometimes the tongue is able to compensate for most oral functions, but speech may be affected. The treatment for ankyloglossia is a surgical procedure (frenulectomy) that relaxes the tight band of tissue that is restricting the tongue\'s movements.' "
What are tongue problems in infants and children?,"'The most common tongue problem found amongst infants and young children is oral thrush characterized by white patches on the tongue. It often occurs after a course of antibiotics is taken by the infant or ''breastfeeding'' mother. ""Good bacteria"" is killed off allowing for an overgrowth of yeast. Treatment involves antifungal medications for the infant and, if ''breastfed'', the mother to avoid passing the infection back and forth.''Other common tongue problems found in children are:''A less common tongue problems in children is ""strawberry tongue,"" as seen in Kawasaki\'s disease.'   fissured tongue, geographic tongue, traumatic injury, and aphthous ulcers (canker sores)."
What are tongue problems in pregnancy?,'A small percentage of women experience a ''sore tongue'' while ''pregnant''. This may be related to the hormonal changes taking place during ''pregnancy''. The soreness could also be in combination with geographic tongue where bare areas are present and disappear as well as reappear. These conditions usually resolve after the pregnancy ends.' 
What specialists treat tongue problems?,"'Depending on the tongue problem, there is a specific doctor for treatment. Initially, evaluation of tongue problems can be assessed by a dentist and if needed, an appropriate specialist can be recommended for further evaluation and subsequent treatment.''For tongue lesions such as changes in color, growths, or texture changes, an oral surgeon or an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat specialist, also known as an ENT specialist) can evaluate the area, perform a biopsy, and follow up or refer for appropriate treatment such as surgery or medication. Tongue pain may also be addressed with an oral surgeon or ENT, but a neurology specialist may be appropriate if the pain is related to neuralgia. Tongue movement problems stemming from injury may also be treated by a neurology specialist in conjunction with occupational or physical therapists.''For tongue cancer, a group of specialists could be involved depending on the spread of the disease. A head and neck surgeon, an oncologist, a radiation oncologist, an oral surgeon, and a dentist could comprise the team of doctors that help in treating the oral cancer patient.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose tongue problems?,"'During an examination with a physician or dentist, information based on symptoms and clinical appearance is collected. Imaging may also be needed to aid in diagnosis. The different imaging modalities include ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'""), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET). Based on the collective information, a diagnosis is made. However, if there isn't a unique sign or symptom to distinguish the tongue problem, a differential diagnosis is reviewed. A differential diagnosis lists all the possible causes of the signs and symptoms. It is a systematic process of weighing the probability of one disease versus that of other diseases that may account for the tongue problem. For example, a white tongue lesion may have the differential diagnosis of lichen planus, leukoplakia, or contact inflammation from dentures. Each of these causes can be carefully considered based on what is observed. Subsequently, a plan of treatment can be made.""'For many tongue conditions that might be cancer, a special dye called toluidine blue has been useful to aid during the initial evaluation. Toluidine blue staining is able to help in early identification of ''precancerous'' or cancerous lesions.''A more definite diagnosis requires a biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure whereby a sample of cells or tissue is evaluated under a microscope. Optimal treatment requires a precise diagnosis.' "
Are there home remedies for tongue problems?,"'For pain related to the tongue, ''over-the-counter'' pain-relief medications such as ''ibuprofen'' (Advil) or ''naproxen'' (Aleve) may help. ""Burning tongue"" pain may be alleviated with sucking on ice or bathing the tongue in ''cold'' water. Such home remedies, however, may provide only temporary relief.''For the most part, tongue conditions that appear to have no known cause (such as an obvious injury) should be evaluated by a physician or dentist for appropriate diagnosis, monitoring, and possible treatment.' "
What are the treatments for tongue problems?,"'The treatment of a tongue problem depends on the underlying cause. For some tongue problems, no treatment is necessary whereas for other conditions, medications, surgery, or radiation may be needed. If the tongue issue is a result of an underlying medical condition, treatment of the underlying problem can be key to solving the problem.'  "
Is it possible to prevent tongue problems?,"'Some tongue problems are preventable by practicing good oral hygiene and eating a healthy, nutritious diet. Some tongue conditions cannot be prevented at all, but symptoms may be managed with treatment. Other tongue problems may be a byproduct of an underlying medical condition that needs to be addressed. For example, signs of an ''HIV'' infection (or final stage of ''HIV'' infection, ''AIDS'') often appear in the mouth along with other bodily symptoms. ''HIV'' testing is important in determining if HIV treatment and care is needed.''Exercising moderation or altogether quitting the habit of smoking and drinking alcohol will decrease the risk of developing oral cancer. A ''vaccine'' for HPV is being studied, and it may help in guarding against oral cancers, as well. Oral cancer screenings should always take place during routine dental visits. Screenings can also take place with an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physician. These oral cancer screenings involve an examination of all the soft tissues in the mouth, including the tongue, floor of the mouth (under the tongue), palate (roof of the mouth), inside of the cheeks, and throat area.' "
What is the prognosis for tongue problems?,"'Fortunately, most tongue problems are benign and treatable. Therefore, the prognosis is generally very good.''In regard to growths on the tongue, the main concern is oral cancer. Early detection and treatment usually provides the best chance for recovery and survival. The prognosis for oral cancer is dependent upon the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor, and whether the cancer has spread to blood vessels. Frequent follow-up and close monitoring are crucial parts of care. Unfortunately, the overall prognosis for oral cancer is generally poor. In the U.S., approximately half of individuals newly diagnosed with oral cancer do not survive after more than five years. Despite advances in treatment with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, the poor prognosis is due to the cancer being discovered at a later stage in its development.''When treating tongue cancer with surgery, the patient may experience the complication of numbness of the tongue. The numbness may or may not resolve. Radiation and chemotherapy treatment may also cause decreased saliva flow and changes in taste that may take time to improve or not improve at all.' "
What is tonometry?,'Tonometry is a method of measuring the pressure in the eye by measuring the tone or firmness of its surface.' 
What is the intraocular pressure?,"'Tonometry is very useful to doctors for measurement of the pressure in the eye, or the ''intraocular pressure'' (IOP). An elevated IOP can be dangerous because people with varying degrees of IOP elevation may develop damage to the ''optic nerve''. The optic nerve collects all of the visual information from the retina of the eye and transmits that information to the brain, where the signals are interpreted as vision. When changes occur in the optic nerve leading to decreased peripheral vision and loss of the nerve tissues, a diagnosis of ''glaucoma'' can be made.''Glaucoma'' is a fairly common condition. Many people with glaucoma have not been checked and therefore do not know that they have it. Thus, glaucoma screening efforts as well as regular eye examinations are essential to detect glaucoma at the earliest possible stages.''Glaucoma is usually, but not always, associated with elevated pressure in the eye Actually, glaucoma is now considered a disease of the optic nerve, or ''optic neuropathy''. Generally speaking, the ''vision loss'' in glaucoma usually occurs in both eyes, and is thus termed bilateral. As in many other disease states, the vision loss may not be symmetric, that is, one eye may be worse than the other. Vision loss due to glaucoma often begins with a subtle decrease in peripheral vision. If the glaucoma is not diagnosed and treated, it may progress to loss of ''central vision'' and ''blindness''.''Vision loss in the chronic open-angle form of glaucoma generally occurs gradually over many years, while the vision loss of acute angle closure glaucoma may occur within a matter of days if not immediately treated. Since patients with ''open-angle glaucoma'' rarely notice their gradual peripheral visual field loss, they may not visit an eye doctor until advanced changes have occurred. Unfortunately, the visual field loss in glaucoma represents permanent damage to the optic nerve and is therefore irreversible. For this reason, glaucoma is often called the sneak thief of sight.' "
Who is at risk for glaucoma?,"'Glaucoma occurs when the normal fluid in the front of the eye chamber, the aqueous humor, is blocked from leaving the eye during the normal aqueous turnover process. This blockage can occur for a number of reasons, the most common of which is simply poor outflow due to chronic open-angle glaucoma. A number of other problems can also impede the ability of the outflow channels to function properly, thus creating elevated IOP. Glaucoma is rarely if ever a disease of excessive aqueous humor production. An eye doctor, your ophthalmologist or optometrist, can usually detect those individuals who are at risk for glaucoma. These patients are called ""glaucoma suspects"" and must be monitored closely for subtle changes in their visual field or in their optic nerve.''There are many risk factors for glaucoma, including:''The eye doctor also can diagnose patients who already have glaucoma by observing their nerve for damage or detecting visual field loss with a peripheral ''visual field test''. Patients with glaucoma must be monitored closely for the remainder of their lifetime in order to adequately treat the IOP and assess treatment effectiveness. It is extremely cost effective to avoid visual disability due to glaucoma, enabling the at-risk patient or the patient with glaucoma to have an active lifestyle with functional central and peripheral vision.' family history of glaucoma, anatomical variations including narrow filtering angles or anatomical damage to the filtering angles, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), diabetes mellitus, previous ocular trauma, injury, or surgery, use of steroid pills, eye drops, patches, injections, or nasal sprays, excessive pigment in the front or anterior segment of the eye, many congenital disorders of the eye such as Peter's anomaly or Sturge-Weber syndrome, many degenerative disorders of the eye such as pseudoexfoliation syndrome, extremely advanced cataract, African American heritage, proven visual field loss or anatomical changes in the optic nerves, inflammatory disorders of the eye such as iritis, uveitis, or pars planitis, many infectious diseases of the eye such as Herpes simplex, toxoplasmosis, Fuch's uveitis syndrome, or shingles (Herpes zoster), an extremely thin cornea, and excessively high myopia, generally greater than 6 diopters."
How is tonometry done?,"'Tonometry is generally performed upon an anesthetized ocular surface.  Anesthesia is generally rendered with a single drop of topical anesthetic, such as proparicaine (Alcaine) or tetracaine (Pontocaine).  The tonometer device lightly touches the surface of the eye, ever so slightly indenting the cornea.  The resistance to indentation is measured by a precisely calibrated pressure sensing device, the tonometer.  Several types of tonometers are available for this test, the most common being the applanation tonometer:'""After the eye has been numbed by the technician or doctor with anesthetic eye drops, the tonometer's sensor is placed against the surface of the eye.  The firmer the tone of the surface of the eye, the higher the pressure reading.  The doctor can record the pressure reading, and this can be used to diagnose or monitor the treatment of glaucoma.  Also, the pressure reading is lower than otherwise expected if the cornea is thin.  Thus, patients with a thin cornea may obtain a falsely low IOP reading when the actual pressure is high.  These patients must be watched more closely for glaucoma."" Goldman applanation tonometer: the ""gold standard"" instrument attached to the slit lamp biomicroscope used in all eye doctors' offices. It requires a cobalt blue light source and a small droplet of fluorescein on the ocular surface. A tiny pressure sensor attached to a spring-loaded arm is gently placed against the tear film, and the doctor or technician reads the pressure through the microscope under the blue light. Tono-Pen handheld electronic contact tonometer: This widely used, portable, handheld device runs on hearing aid batteries and calibrates digitally with the push of a button.  It requires a disposable sterile cover for each patient.  The sterile device tip is gently placed against the tear film by the doctor or technician, and the pressure reading appears on the digital readout simultaneous to a faintly audible beep. pneumotonometer contact device: The device is operated similarly to the handheld tonopen tonometer, but due to its larger size, it's not readily portable.  It requires a continuous gas supply and separate gauge container with analog readout attached to a long tube and pressure probe.  This is an older technology and has largely been replaced by the handheld tonopen tonometer. The airpuff noncontact tonometer, which generally requires no anesthetic drop, is widely used in doctor's offices, clinics, and screening facilities.  It is very safe due to the ""no touch"" technology, but it often produces falsely elevated readings, particularly in patients who squeeze their muscles upon anticipation of the air puff.  The patient simply sits then places their chin in a rest while looking straight ahead, while the operator activates the air puff mechanism while aligning each eye individually. Tactile finger applanation over the closed eyelid by a skilled eye doctor is an age-old traditional method utilized by the experienced practitioner. Intraocular sensors for experimental or intraoperative use during surgery are utilized in research and technology development companies.  Hopefully, these will become universally available for long-term use and patient self-readout. Patient self-testing devices are in their infancy.  The ProVision device marketed by Bausch & Lomb allows the patient to gently press a calibrated spring-loaded piston against the closed eyelid over the upper, outer quadrant of the eyeball while gazing downward.  The true IOP is reached when the pressure applied onto the globe produces faint lights in the eye, or phosphenes, readily perceived by the patient and thereby recorded at home."
What is tonometry used for?,"'Tonometry is an essential component of the global examination in all eye check-ups and specifically for a glaucoma examination. A complete glaucoma examination has a number of important components.'""These tests together give a complete picture of the patient's ocular health and therefore the risks for developing or controlling a given disease such as ""'cataracts'', ''macular degeneration'', or glaucoma. The following tests make up a glaucoma examination:''Once the examinations have been completed, a decision is made as to whether or not glaucoma treatment should be given, maintained at its current level, or modified. If the patient is doing well, then glaucoma treatment may be withheld or cut back. If the patient is doing poorly, then more treatment may be recommended. There are several approaches to glaucoma treatment, any or all of which may be appropriate for a given patient. These include but are not limited to the following:''The bottom line for any patient, and particularly the patient who might be at risk for glaucoma, is to have regular visits to your eye doctor. Patients over the age of 50, or patients at risk of glaucoma over the age of 40, should have regular annual eye examinations.' medical and ocular history visual acuity testing refraction to measure the glasses or lens correction tonometry testing for IOP Slit lamp biomicroscope examination is the ""stethoscope"" of the eye doctor. This high-quality optical device allows the doctor to view the eyes in stereo under high magnification while the patient places their chin on a rest and their forehead against a bar to maintain consistent positioning. Numerous details can be discerned by the trained observer, rendering possible a specific diagnosis, including the etiology (or cause) of an individual patient's glaucoma. gonioscopy to examine the aqueous humor outflow channels peripheral visual field testing Optic nerve head photography is taken by high-quality cameras and recorded, usually digitally. This allows precise comparison from year to year, permitting analysis of subtle anatomical changes over time. Optic nerve head topography, including timaging techniques like Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), create precise digital images of the nerve thickness around the optic nerve to within 1/1000 of a millimeter. These detailed images of the retina document any changes in a precise objective way. Subtle loss of nerve thickness indicates the progression of glaucoma. topical eye drop medications: beta blockers, prostaglandins, alpha agonists, aqueous suppressants, and miotics oral ocular hypotensive or pressure-lowering medications: most commonly acetazolamide (Diamox) or methazolamide (MZM). laser treatment: SLT (selective laser trabeculoplasty) or ALT (argon laser trabeculoplasty) for open-angle glaucoma and PI (peripheral iridotomy) for closed-angle glaucoma filtering procedure: Traditional trabeculectomy surgery permits drainage of the aqueous humor in the front of the eye to a bubble or bleb on the conjunctiva, or clear surface over the white part of the eye. This surgery has been performed for centuries and has been highly perfected under the outstanding control of the operating-room microscope by skilled surgical hands. shunting procedure: The eye doctor places a plastic tube and emptying chamber into the eye in the operating room. Commonly used devices include the Molteno shunt, the Express shunt, the Baerveldt valve, and the Ahmed valve. This procedure accomplishes the same effect as the trabeculectomy but generally lasts longer because the plastic tube avoids closure by normal progressive tissue scarring. outflow enhancement procedures: These include the viscocanalostomy or the canaloplasty operations that allow the drainage of aqueous humor without a conjunctival bleb or plastic drainage device. Instead, the natural drainage pathways in the anterior or front of the eye are opened surgically, allowing more facile egress of aqueous into the channels of the ocular surface and orbit, or eye socket. Newer oral medication strategies to preserve or enhance optic nerve head function: These include antioxidants such as ginkgo biloba or prescription neuro-protectants such as memantine (Namenda)."
What are the tonsils and adenoids?,"""The tonsils and adenoids are composed of tissues similar to the lymph nodes or glands found in the neck or other parts of the body. Together, they are part of a ring of glandular tissue (Waldeyer's ring) encircling the back of the throat.""'The tonsils and adenoids are part of the immune system thought to assist the body in its defense against incoming bacteria and viruses by helping the body form antibodies. However, this function may only be important during the first year of life. There is no evidence to support a significant role of the tonsils and adenoids in immunity. Medical studies have shown that children who have their tonsils and adenoids removed suffer no loss in their future immunity to disease or ability to ward off infections.' The tonsils are the two oval-shaped masses of tissue on either side of the back of the throat. Normal tonsils are usually about the same size and have the same pink color as the surrounding area. On their surfaces are little depressions, called crypts, which may appear deep and contain pus-filled pockets or tonsil stones. The adenoids are located high in the throat behind the nose and soft palate (the roof of the mouth) and unlike the tonsils, are not easily visible through the mouth. A tonsillectomy and an adenoidectomy (commonly referred to as a T & A) are surgical procedures performed to remove the tonsils and adenoids."
What are tonsillitis and adenoid infection symptoms a signs?,"'The most prominent symptom of tonsillitis and adenoid infection is a ''sore throat'' (''pharyngitis''). Other signs and symptoms of tonsillitis and adenoid infection include the following:''When there is a ''sore throat'' and coldsymptoms such as; congestion,\xa0runny nose, ''sneezing'', andcoughing,the cause is most likely a virus. Viral infection of the tonsils or adenoids usually resolves without treatment within two weeks.''Sore throat with a sudden mild fever, without symptoms of an ''upper respiratory tract infection'', may point to a bacterial infection called group A beta-hemolytic ''streptococcus'' (GABHS). If these symptoms are present, see a doctor for diagnosis because of the risk of ''strep throat''. Although ''strep throat'' will usually go away even without treatment, an untreated ''strep'' bacterial infection can lead to complications including ''rheumatic fever'', which can permanently damage the ''heart''.'""When there is a sore throat that does not affect the tonsils, medical professionals call this pharyngitis. When both the throat and the tonsils are affected, it's called pharyngotonsillitis.""   Fever Bad breath Congestion and runny nose Swollen lymph nodes in front of the neck Red, swollen tonsils with patches of pus (white spots) Painful swallowing (odynophagia) or difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) Loss of voice or muffled voice Headache Abdominal pain Coughing up blood With enlarged adenoids, breathing through the nose may be difficult and symptoms may include:Breathing through the mouth, especially in childrenNoisy breathing in the day; snoring at night is often observedNasal-sounding voice Breathing through the mouth, especially in children Noisy breathing in the day; snoring at night is often observed Nasal-sounding voice"
Is tonsillitis contagious?,"'Tonsillitis may or may not be ''contagious'', depending on the cause. If the cause is viral, it is usually contagious, but this depends upon whether or not a person has been exposed to that particular virus before. ''Mononucleosis'', a viral cause of sore throat, is contagious the first time a person comes in contact with the virus, usually in childhood or adolescence.''If the cause of the tonsillitis is bacterial, it is also contagious. For example, ''strep throat'' is highly contagious.''If the tonsillitis and enlarged adenoids are chronic or caused by a chronic condition, such as ''sinusitis'', ''hay fever'' or ''chronic rhinitis'', it likely is not contagious.' "
What causes tonsillitis and adenoid infections?,"'The most common problems occurring with the tonsils and adenoids are''Acute tonsillitis is an infection of the tonsils caused by one of several possible types of bacteria or viruses. Symptoms of acute tonsillitis can either come on suddenly, or be of a gradual onset of a sore throat usually accompanied by a fever.''Other signs and symptoms of acute tonsillitis include:''Strep'' throat is a specific type of infection caused by the ''Streptococcus'' bacteria. Strep tonsillitis can cause secondary damage to the heart valves (''rheumatic fever'') and kidneys (glomerulonephritis). It can also lead to a skin ''rash'' (for example, ''scarlet fever''), ''sinusitis'', ''pneumonia'', and ''ear infections''.''The ''Epstein-Barr virus'' causes acute mononucleosis and can lead to a very severe throat infection characterized by the rapid enlargement of the tonsils, adenoids, and lymph nodes of the neck. It also causes extreme malaise and ''tiredness''. The sore throat and gland swelling can last for one week to a month and does not respond to the usually prescribed antibiotics.''Chronic tonsillitis is a persistent infection of the tonsils. Repeated infections may cause the formation of small pockets (crypts) in the tonsils, which harbor bacteria. Frequently, small foul-smelling stones develop within these crypts. These stones (tonsilloliths) may contain high quantities of sulfa. When crushed, they give off the characteristic rotten egg smell, which causes bad breath. They may also give a patient the sense of something caught in the back of the throat.''A peritonsillar abscess is a collection of pus around the tonsils that pushes one of the tonsils toward the uvula (the prominent soft tissue dangling from the back of the upper throat). It is generally very painful and is associated with decreased ability to open the mouth. If left untreated, the infection can spread deep in the neck causing life-threatening complications and ''airway'' obstruction.''Obstruction to breathing by enlarged tonsils and adenoids may cause snoring and disturbed ''sleep'' patterns that may lead to sleep pauses or ''sleep apnea''.''Other signs and symptoms include:''Some orthodontists believe chronic mouth breathing from large tonsils and adenoids causes improper alignment of the ''teeth'' (malocclusion).''Chronic enlargement and infection of the adenoids may lead to infection of the air passages around the nose (sinusitis) or nasal drainage/obstruction, and/or may affect the Eustachian tube of the ears, leading to chronic ''ear infections''.'   acute, recurrent, or chronic infections and significant enlargement (hypertrophy). Difficulty swallowing saliva Drooling Ear pain with swallowing Bad breath Tonsil surface may be bright red or have a grayish-white coating (exudate). Lymph nodes in the neck may be swollen.

(pictures)?", 
What tests diagnose tonsillitis and adenoid infections?,"'Physicians make a diagnosis of tonsillitis and adenoid infection based on a medical history and a physical exam.''If symptoms suggest strep throat, the doctor may order a throat culture or rapid strep test, which medical professionals perform by swabbing the back of the throat and checking for the ''Streptococcus'"" bacteria. This can be performed in the doctor's office. If a physician suspects the Epstein-Barr virus, which can cause mononucleosis, as a cause for the tonsillitis, a blood test for mononucleosis may be done.""'Strep throat is more likely if at least three of the following signs or symptoms are present:''Antibiotic treatment may be needed if a bacteria caused the infection. In more severe, recurrent tonsillitis or adenoid infection, or in chronic cases, surgery to remove the tonsils or adenoids (tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy) may be recommended to cure the condition.'   Fever White or yellow spots or coating on the throat and/or tonsils (tonsillar exudates) Red spots on the roof of the mouth (upper palette) Swollen or tender lymph nodes on the neck Absence of coughing or sneezing"
What OTC and antibiotic treatments cure tonsillitis and adenoid infections?,"'Various antibiotics treat bacterial infections of the tonsils and adenoids. Tonsillitis caused by the ''Streptococcus'' bacteria can lead to serious complications. Once treatment begins, it is important to take the full course of antibiotics as prescribed because if you stop taking the ''drugs'' before they are finished it can lead to adverse consequences and regrowth of the bacteria. Physicians consider surgical removal in situations resistant to medical therapy or in frequently recurrent tonsillitis infections.''Medical professionals often treat viral causes of tonsillitis or enlarged adenoids with only supportive care (hydration and control of fever) and ''over-the-counter'' ''pain'' medications. Do not give ''aspirin'"" to a child or teen unless directed by a doctor due to the risk of a condition called Reye's syndrome. Antibiotics are not effective for viral infection of the tonsils.""'A peritonsillar abscess should be drained either by removal of fluid with a needle and syringe (needle aspiration), cutting open with a scalpel (incision), or tonsillectomy. People can remove chronic stones in the tonsil with a clean finger or with a blunt probe. A long course of antibiotics may treat massive enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids causing airway obstruction, or even a brief course of steroids to reduce inflammation (cortisone-related medications, such as ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone'').'  "
What natural home remedies help soothe tonsillitis pain and inflammation?,"'If a doctor has diagnosed tonsillitis, some home remedies can help soothe the symptoms of a sore throat.''Some alternative remedies may help ease tonsillitis symptoms.''Consult your doctor before using any alternative remedies. Doctors do not recommend many of these home remedies for use in children or adolescents as most have not been scientifically evaluated.' Throat sprays and lozenges: These can coat and moisturize the throat, and many have a topical anesthetic to relieve pain (consult a doctor before giving lozenges to young children; they can be a choking hazard) Saltwater gargle: This helps clear mucus from the throat Sipping warm beverages such as tea with honey, or broth can be soothing Eating cold foods such as ice cream or popsicles can help ease pain Slippery elm in lozenge form may help with pain relief Serrapeptase is an enzyme that has anti-inflammatory properties and can help decrease pain and help with swallowing Papain is an enzyme that can help treat inflammation Andrographis can help treat fever and sore throat symptoms"
When is surgery necessary for tonsilitis and/or adenoid infections?,"'Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are indicated in people with repeated or persistent infections, particularly if they interfere with everyday activities. The American Academy of Otolaryngology defines repeated infections in children as seven episodes in one year, or five episodes in each of two years, or three episodes in each of three years.''Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are also warranted in situations where there is enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids to such an extent that it causes severe ''sleep problems'' (snoring and breath holding), ''sleep apnea'', dental abnormalities, and difficulty swallowing. Adenoid enlargement alone, or in combination with tonsillar enlargement, can cause nasal obstruction, recurrent ''ear infections'', or sinusitis. If these conditions are resistant to medical therapy, surgery is indicated to cure them.''A significant episode of tonsillitis is defined by one or more of the following criteria: (1) a temperature greater than 101 F (38.3 C); (2) enlarged or tender neck lymph nodes; (3) pus material coating the tonsils; or (4) a positive strep test.''In adults, the severity, frequency, and hardship associated with repeated infections are considered more important than the absolute number. Chronic infections characterized by bad breath and/or tonsillar stones causing significant disability are also indicators for tonsillectomy.''Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are strongly considered in those patients who are suffering, or may suffer serious complications of infection. These include peritonsillar abscess, history of streptococcal complications (rheumatic ''heart disease'', glomerulonephritis), or neck abscess. Suspicion of ''cancer'' (''malignancy'') or ''tumor'' is a definite reason for surgery.'""It should be emphasized that all decisions for or against removing the tonsils or adenoids are dependent upon the individual patient's particular situation. Additional factors, such as tolerance of antibiotics, concurrent medical problems, school achievement/progress, and family preferences are also important factors in the decision process."" "
Which types of doctors treat tonsillitis and adenoid infections?,"""A primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner, an internist, or a child's pediatrician may diagnose and treat simple tonsillitis and adenoid infections. If your tonsillitis is severe enough that you go to an emergency department, you will be seen by an ""'emergency medicine'' specialist. If infections are severe, chronic, or recurrent, you may be referred to an otolaryngologist, also called an ear-nose-throat (ENT) specialist for further follow-up treatment or surgical removal of the tonsils and/or adenoids.' "
What are tonsil stones?,"'The ''tonsils'' are ''lymph nodes'' located at the back of the throat. ''Tonsil stones'' (also called tonsilloliths or tonsil calculi) are small clusters of calcifications or stones that form in the craters (crypts) of the ''tonsils''. ''Tonsil stones'' are hard, and appear as white or yellowish formations on the ''tonsils''. They usually smell bad (and make your breath smell bad) due to bacteria.'  "
What causes tonsil stones?,"'Several factors can cause or contribute to the formation of tonsil stones.''Risk factors for developing tonsil stones include people with:'   Substances such as food, dead cells, mucus, and bacteria may get stuck in the nooks and crannies of the tonsils. The body’s immune system, which sees these as foreign invaders, sends white blood cells to the area to fight infection. When the white blood cells are done, they leave small calcifications behind. Usually, these small stones are swallowed but sometimes they get stuck in the tonsillar crypts and continue to grow into tonsil stones. Small stones are common; large stones are rare. Chronic or recurring tonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils) Large tonsils Chronic sinus problems Poor dental hygiene Certain medications that make your mouth dry"
What are symptoms of tonsil stones?,"'In many cases, tonsil stones do not cause any symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they may include:'  Persistent bad breath (halitosis) White or yellow formations on the tonsil Sore throat Difficulty swallowing Ear pain Swollen tonsils Sensation of a foreign object lodged in the back of the throat/choking feeling Cough Chronic tonsil inflammation/infection"
What specialists treat tonsil stones?, 
How are tonsil stones diagnosed?,"'Tonsil stones can frequently be seen in the back of the throat. They typically appear as white or yellowish spots on or around the tonsils that may range in size from a grain of rice to a pea.''For stones that cannot be visualized, an ''MRI'' or ''CT scan'' can help make a definitive diagnosis.' "
What are the treatments for tonsil stones?,"'Tonsil stones treatment is not always needed. Stones frequently either dissolve on their own or are coughed up.''For stones that do not go away on their own, there are several types of treatments:'  Medications:Antibiotics to help reduce bacteriaAntihistamines to reduce mucus from sinus problems or allergies Antibiotics to help reduce bacteria Antihistamines to reduce mucus from sinus problems or allergies Laser treatment (laser tonsil cryptolysis): a noninvasive treatment that helps minimize or remove the tonsil pockets (crypts) where the tonsil stones are lodged Coblation cryptolysis: radio waves used to change a salt solution into charged ions that can cut through tissue to reduce crypts on the tonsils and eliminate tonsil stones Tonsillectomy: removal of the tonsils, usually a last resort but the only way to completely eliminate tonsil stones and prevent new ones from forming"
How to get rid of tonsil stones at home,"'Manual tonsil stone removal at home is generally not recommended. Tonsils are delicate tissues, and removing them on your own may cause bleeding and infection.''Home remedies to get rid of tonsil stones include:'   Salt-water gargle: This may help dislodge tonsil stones and get rid of the odor and bad breath they cause. Coughing: Tonsil stones are often coughed up inadvertently. In some cases, a hard cough may help dislodge them. Oral irrigation: Oral irrigators can sometimes be used to gently shoot water into the back of the mouth in an attempt to dislodge the tonsil stones. Follow instructions and use caution because it is possible to injure the tonsils if it is not done gently."
How to prevent tonsil stones,'There are several ways to prevent tonsil stones:' Maintain good oral hygiene: Brush and floss regularly; consider using a tongue scraper to remove bacteria. Gargle regularly with mouthwash or salt water solution. Drink plenty of water. Quit smoking. Avoid excess alcohol. Reduce consumption of carbonated beverages such as sodas. Treat sinus infections or allergy symptoms promptly. Limit dairy products.
How long do tonsil stones last?,"'The length of time tonsil stones last varies and depends on a number of factors.''Tonsil stones may dislodge or dissolve on their own in a short time.''Tonsil stones may last for weeks if bacteria continue to grow on the tonsils due to tonsil stones deep in the throat.''If tonsil stones are ignored and left in place without lifestyle changes, they may last for years.''The only surefire way to cure tonsil stones and prevent any recurrence is to have the tonsils removed (''tonsillectomy'').' "
What are tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy?,"'Your doctor has recommended a tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy for you, a loved one, or your child. The following information is provided to help individuals prepare for surgery, and to help those involved understand more clearly the associated benefits, risks, and complications. Patients or caregivers are encouraged to ask the doctor any questions they feel necessary to help better understand the above procedure.''The tonsils and adenoids are masses of immune cells commonly found in lymph glands (lymphoid tissue). These tissues are located in the mouth and behind the nasal passages, respectively. Infected or enlarged tonsils may cause chronic or recurrent ''sore throat'', ''bad breath'', dental malocclusion, ''abscess'', upper ''airway'' obstruction causing difficulty with swallowing, ''snoring'', or ''sleep apnea''. Infected adenoids may become enlarged, obstruct ''breathing'', cause ''ear infections'', or other problems. Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are surgical procedures performed to remove the tonsils and adenoids.''These instructions are designed to help you, a loved one, or your child recover from surgery as easily as possible. Taking care of yourself or the individual having surgery can prevent complications. The doctor will be happy to answer any questions that you or the person having surgery has regarding this material. If you or your loved one, or child is having ear tube surgery (myringotomies and tympanostomy tubes placed) in conjunction with his/her tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, please read information on these procedures as well.'  "
What are the risks and complications of tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy?,"""The patient's surgery will be performed safely and with care in order to obtain the best possible results. The surgery may involve risks of unsuccessful results, complications, or injury from both known and unforeseen causes. Because individuals differ in their response to surgery, their anesthetic reactions, and their healing outcomes, ultimately there can be no guarantee made as to the results or potential complications. Furthermore, surgical outcomes may be dependent on preexisting or concurrent medical conditions.""'The following complications have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. They are listed here for your information only, not to frighten you, but to make you aware and more knowledgeable concerning this surgical procedure. Although many of these complications are rare, all have occurred at one time or another in the hands of experienced surgeons practicing the standard of community care. Anyone who is contemplating surgery must weigh the potential risks and complications against the potential benefits of the surgery or any alternative to surgery.'   Failure to alleviate every episode of sore throat, or resolve subsequent or concurrent ear or sinus infections/nasal drainage. Possible need for additional surgery. Bleeding. In very rare situations there may be a need for blood products or a blood transfusion. The patient has the right, should he/she choose, to have autologous or designated donor directed blood prepared in advance in case an emergency transfusion was necessary. Patients are encouraged to consult with a doctor if they are interested in this option. Infection, dehydration, prolonged pain, and/or impaired healing that could lead to the necessity for hospital admission for fluids and/or pain control. A permanent change in voice or nasal regurgitation (rare). Failure to improve the nasal airway or resolve snoring, sleep apnea, or mouth breathing."
What happens before surgery?,"'In most situations the surgery is performed as an outpatient at either a hospital or a surgery center. In both facilities, quality care is provided without the expense and inconvenience of an overnight stay. An anesthesiologist will monitor the patient throughout the procedure. Usually, the anesthesiologist (or surgery staff) will call the night before surgery to review the medical history. If they are unable to reach the patient the night before surgery, they will talk with the patient the morning of the surgery. If the doctor has ordered preoperative laboratory studies, the patient should arrange to have these done several days in advance. The patient should arrange for someone to take them to the surgical facility, back home, and to spend the first night after surgery with the patient.''The patient should not take ''aspirin'', or any product containing aspirin, within 10 days of the date of the surgery. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''ibuprofen'', ''Advil'', and others) should not be taken within 7 days of the date of surgery. Many ''over-the-counter products'' contain aspirin or ibuprofen-related ''drugs'' so it is important to check all medications carefully. If there is any question please call the office or consult a pharmacist. ''Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is an acceptable ''pain reliever''. Usually the doctor will give the patient several prescriptions at the preoperative visit. It is best to have these filled prior to the date of surgery so they are available when you return home.'""If it is a child who is having the surgery, it is advised that you be honest and up front with them as you explain their upcoming surgery. Encourage the child to think of this as something the doctor will do to make them healthier. Let them know that they will be safe and that you will be close by. A calming and reassuring attitude will greatly ease the child's ""'anxiety''. Let the child know that if they have pain, it will only last for a short time and that they can take medicine to help relieve it. You may want to consider a visit to the surgical facility or hospital several days in advance to that the child can become familiar with the setting. Contact the surgical facility or hospital to arrange for a tour.''The patient must not eat or drink anything 6 hours prior to the time of surgery. This includes even water, candy, or chewing gum. Anything in the stomach increases the chances of an anesthetic complication.''If the patient is ill or has a ''fever'"" the day before surgery, call the surgeon's office. If the patient wakes up sick the day of surgery, still proceed to the surgical facility as planned. The doctor will decide if it's safe to proceed with surgery. However, if your child has ""'chickenpox'', do not bring your child to the office or to the surgical facility.' "
What takes place the day of surgery?,"'It is important that the patient (or ''caregiver'') knows precisely what time they are to check in with the surgical facility, and that they allow sufficient preparation time. Bring all papers, forms, and insurance information including the preoperative orders and history sheets. The patient should wear comfortable, loose fitting clothes, (pajamas are OK). Leave all jewelry and valuables at home. Children may bring a favorite toy, stuffed animal, or blanket.''The patient should not take any medication unless instructed by the doctor or anesthesiologist. Usually in the pre-operative holding room, a nurse will start an intravenous infusion line (IV) and the patient may be given a medication to help them relax.' "
What happens during surgery?,"'In the operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of ''gas'' and an intravenous medication for the general anesthetic. In most situations, an IV will have been started either in the preoperative holding room or after the patient has been given a mask anesthetic. During the procedure, the patient will be continuously monitored by a pulse oximeter (measuring oxygen saturation) and a continuous ''heart'' rate monitor. The surgical team is well trained and prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room.''After the anesthetic takes effect, the doctor will remove the tonsils and/or adenoids through the mouth. There will be no external incisions. The base of the tonsils and/or adenoids will be burned (cauterized) with an electrical cauterizing unit. The whole procedure usually takes less than 60 minutes. The doctor will come to the waiting room to talk with any family or friends once the patient is safely transferred to the recovery room.' "
What happens after surgery?,"'After surgery, the patient will be taken to the recovery room where a nurse will monitor them. Relatives are generally invited into the recovery room as the patient becomes aware of their surroundings, and if the patient is a child, they will be looking for his or her parent(s) or caregiver. The patient will be able to go home the same day as the surgery once they have fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes several hours. The patient will need a friend or family member to pick them up from the surgical facility to take them home. A relative, caregiver, or friend should spend the first night after surgery with the patient.''When the patient arrives home from the surgical facility, they should go to bed and rest with the head elevated on 2-3 pillows. Keeping the head elevated above the heart minimizes ''edema'' and swelling. Applying an ice pack to the neck may help decrease swelling. The patient may get out of bed with assistance to use the bathroom. Visitors should be kept to a minimum since they may unknowingly expose the patient to infection, or cause over excitement. If the patient is constipated, avoid straining and take a ''stool softener'' or a gentle ''laxative''.''Once the patient has recovered from the anesthetic, if tolerable, a light, soft, and cool ''diet'' is recommended. Avoid hot liquids for several days. Even though the patient may be hungry immediately after surgery, it is best to feed slowly to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Occasionally, the patient may vomit one or two times immediately after surgery. However, if it persists, the doctor may prescribe medications to settle the stomach. It is important to remember that a good overall ''diet'' with ample rest promotes healing. ''Weight loss'' is very common following a tonsillectomy. The patient need not worry about nutritional requirements during the recovery so long as they are drinking adequate amounts of fluid.''The patient may be prescribed antibiotics after surgery. The patient should take all of the antibiotics prescribed by the doctor. Some form of a narcotic will also be prescribed (usually acetaminophen/Tylenol with ''codeine''), and is to be taken as needed. If the patient requires narcotics, he or she is cautioned not to drive. If the patient has ''nausea'' or ''vomiting'' postoperatively, the patient may be prescribed anti-emesis medications such as ''promethazine'' (Phenergan) or ''ondansetron'' (''Zofran''). If the patient or caregivers have any questions or feel the patient is developing a reaction to any of these medications, a doctor should be consulted. Patients should not take or give any other medications, either prescribed or ''over-the-counter'', unless they have been discussed with the doctor.' "
General instructions and follow-up care,"'An appointment for a checkup should be made 10 to 14 days after the procedure. Call the office to schedule this appointment.''The most important thing one can do after a tonsillectomy to prevent bleeding and ''dehydration'' is to drink plenty of fluids. At times it may be very difficult to swallow. If the patient ''drinks'', they will have less pain overall. Try to drink thin dilute, non-acidic drinks or frozen popsicles. Soft foods such as gelatin, ice cream, custards, puddings, and mashed foods are helpful to maintain adequate ''nutrition''. Hot, spicy, coarse, and scratchy foods such as fresh fruits, toast, crackers, and potato chips should be avoided because they may scratch the throat and cause bleeding. If dehydration occurs and attempts at home cannot correct the problem, then admission to the hospital for intravenous fluids will be necessary.'""Pain is common after a tonsillectomy. It is often hard to predict who will recover quickly or who will have prolonged pain. Immediately after surgery, many patients report only minimal pain. The next day the pain may increase and remain significant for several days. At one week following surgery, patient's will often appear to relapse when their pain becomes significant again. They usually report pain in the ears, especially when they swallow. The scabs are often falling off at this time. If bleeding is going to occur, this is the most common time. This pain is usually the last time pain will be experienced. Overall, most patients will have recovered fully by two weeks after surgery. However, the patient will occasionally have throat tenderness with hot or spicy foods for up to 6 weeks postoperatively.""'The patient will notice white patches in the back of the throat where the tonsils were formerly located. These are temporary scabs, which occur during the healing process. They are not a sign of infection, and will fall off within the first two weeks following surgery and no attempt should be made to remove them. They will give the patient ''bad breath'', which will resolve once the area is fully healed. It will take up to 6 weeks for the throat to return to the normal pink color. It is not unusual to have nasal stuffiness following surgery. The nasal stuffiness may last for several months as swelling decreases. Saline nose drops (Ocean Spray) can be used to help dissolve any clots and decrease edema. The patient may notice persistent or even louder snoring for several weeks. A temporary change in voice is common following surgery, and will usually return to normal after several months.'""Bleeding occurs in 1%-3% of patients' after a tonsillectomy. Although it may occur at any time, it usually occurs 5-10 days after the surgery. Dehydration and excessive activity increases the chances of postoperative bleeding. If bleeding occurs, the patient should try to remain calm and relaxed. Rinse the mouth out with ""'cold'' water and rest with the head elevated. If the bleeding continues, call the doctor. Treatment of bleeding can be simple. Rarely, it may require a trip back to the operating room for cauterization of the bleeding area under general anesthesia. In very rare situations, a blood transfusion may become necessary. Conversely, bleeding is rare following an adenoidectomy. There may be some bleeding from the nose following surgery. If it occurs, pediatric ''Neosynephrine'' nose drops can be used. If it is persistent and bright red in color, call the doctor.' "
"When can I go back to school, work, or exercise?","'Most patients require at least 7-10 days off from work or school. After 3 weeks ''exercise'' and ''swimming'' can usually be resumed, but no diving for 6 weeks. The patient should plan to stay in the local area for at least 2-3 weeks to allow for postoperative care and in case you have bleeding.'  "
When to call the doctor,"'Notify the doctor if the patient has:' A sudden increase in the amount of bleeding from the mouth or nose that lasts more than a few minutes. A fever greater than 101.5 F (38.6 C) that persists despite increasing the amount of fluid they drink and administration of acetaminophen (Tylenol and others). A child with a fever should try to drink approximately one-half cup of fluid each waking hour, and an adult should drink one cup per hour. Persistent sharp pain or headache that is not relieved by pain medications prescribed. Increased swelling or redness of the nose, neck, or eyes."
What is an abscessed tooth?,"'When a tooth persistently throbs and keeps you up at night with ''pain'', it could be something more worrisome than a simple ''toothache''. An abscessed tooth is an infection within a tooth that has spread to the root tip or around the root. This infection originates from the tooth\'s inner chamber, which is called the ""pulp chamber."" Contained within the pulp chamber are blood vessels and nerves, collectively called the ""pulp."" Prior to the formation of an ''abscess'', the tooth has essentially lost its ability to fight off infection, and bacteria are able to invade the pulp chamber and multiply. As the bacteria multiply, the bacterial infection usually spreads from the pulp chamber and exits through the bottom of the root into the bone. The abscess is a collection of pus that is made up of dead white blood cells, tissue debris, and bacteria.''A tooth abscess differs from a gum abscess by the source of the original infection. The tooth abscess (or ""periapical abscess"") originates from the pulp of the tooth and exits out the tooth\'s apex at the bottom of the root. A gum abscess (or ""periodontal abscess"") starts in a gum pocket outside of the tooth next to the root from ''gum disease''. Treatment will depend on where the infection originates.' "
What are risk factors for an abscessed tooth?,"'For the most part, poor oral hygiene and dental care increases the risk of an infected tooth. Grinding or clenching ''teeth'' (''bruxism''), high ''sugar'' ''diet'', other tooth ''trauma'', and even the presence of previous dental work can predispose an individual to tooth abscess.' "
What causes an abscessed tooth?,"'There are many causes for a dental abscess. A very common cause is when a dental ''cavity'' (''tooth decay'') becomes so large and deep that it reaches the pulp chamber. An inflammatory process takes place within the tooth. Inflammation of the pulp (pulpitis) is usually what is felt as a ''toothache''. Pulpitis is further characterized by tests done by a dentist as reversible or irreversible. Reversible pulpitis means that the pulp is irritated but has an opportunity to recover. Irreversible pulpitis means that it will not recover, and the pulp is dying. Once the pulp is dead (or ""necrotic""), an abscess can form as the infection spreads from the tooth to the gum ligament and jawbone below. Often, a tooth that becomes necrotic can still be saved if steps are taken to resolve the infection at an early stage.''Other causes for a tooth to become necrotic and abscess are (1) a blow to a tooth, (2) dental treatment such as a ''crown'' or a filling that gets too close to the pulp chamber, or (3) trauma to a tooth from grinding or clenching. In every form of a tooth abscess, the pulp is adversely affected and is unable to recover from the insult or injury. A blow to the tooth can immediately sever the tooth\'s blood supply. When the blood supply is lost, the nutrient supply is also lost. As a result, the pulp quickly dies. Trauma from grinding or clenching (called ""occlusal trauma"") is a slower, progressive injury to a tooth.''A tooth that has been previously treated with a ''root canal'' procedure can also develop an abscess. This is often due to the lack of adequate seal from bacteria within the tooth or even a ''fracture'' of the tooth roots.''Any tooth can develop an abscess, but third molars (''wisdom teeth'') are particularly prone to having a dental abscess because they are difficult to keep clean and can develop decay that can go unnoticed. ''Wisdom teeth'' are often removed to avoid this type of complication.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of an abscessed tooth?,"'It is also important to note that abscessed teeth may not have any symptoms at all. Because the tooth has lost vitality (or the ability to feel stimuli), there may be no pain associated with it. However, the abscess is still present and could be further spreading the dental infection. On occasion, an abscessed tooth is detected during a routine radiographic (X-ray) exam where the patient has not experienced any telltale symptoms of an abscessed tooth.' 

Read Doctor's View
   The tooth turns dark in color compared to surrounding teeth. The byproducts of the necrotic pulp that leach into the porous tooth layer cause this discoloration. In many cases, there may be no tooth pain present. There is pain with eating or with pressing on the tooth. The abscess that has spread out the root tip causes the supporting structures (gum and bone) to be affected. Sometimes the throbbing or pulsating pain is so severe it can't be relieved with pain medications. This is usually related to the infection spreading and causing more pressure on the surrounding structures of gum and bone. There is swelling on the gum tissue that is filled with pus. The raised swelling looks like a pimple near the affected tooth. An open pimple is called a ""draining fistula"" and has ruptured to release pus. This is an obvious sign of infection. Other signs of a tooth abscess are a bad taste or bad odor in the mouth. Swelling of the face, jaw, or surrounding lymph nodes often signals a growing infection. Jaw pain from the swelling can be present, as well."
How do health care professionals diagnose a dental abscess?,"'A primary care provider or pediatrician can assess the signs and symptoms to determine if a dental abscess is present during a check-up. They can then refer the patient to a dental provider for diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis of a tooth abscess is collectively determined by (1) signs and symptoms reported by the patient, (2) exam and tests that are performed by the dentist, and (3) what is visualized with dental radiographs (''X-rays'').' "
What is the treatment for an abscessed tooth?,"'In adult teeth, the usual treatment for an abscessed tooth begins with properly clearing the infection. Treatment depends on how much the tooth infection has spread. The course of action usually involves oral antibiotics such as ''penicillin''. The tooth is opened to remove the infected contents within the pulp chamber. If needed, incision and drainage is performed on the soft tissue to provide further exit of pus and pressure of a growing infection.''In some situations, the infection can spread quickly and require immediate attention. If a dentist is unavailable and there is a ''fever'', swelling in the face, or swelling in the jaw, a visit to the emergency room is recommended. An emergency room visit is imperative if there is difficulty with ''breathing'' or swallowing.''Once the infection is cleared and the tooth can be restored, a root canal procedure is performed. The ""root canal treatment"" cleans out the entire inner space of the tooth (pulp chamber and the associated canals) and seals the space with an inert rubber material called gutta percha. Cleaning and sealing the inner space protects the tooth from further invasive infections. The tooth may need to be extracted if too much tooth structure or bone that surrounds the tooth is lost from tooth decay and infection.'""For children's primary teeth (""'baby teeth''), if a tooth has abscessed, there is very little that can be done to save the tooth. The infection has advanced and there is no way to completely remove all of the infection. The appropriate treatment to eliminate the infection would be extraction of the abscessed tooth. Complete removal of the abscessed tooth is also important in avoiding a persistent infection that could risk harming the adult tooth that is developing underneath. Oral antibiotics may or may not be needed depending on the extent of the infection.''During ''pregnancy'', a dental abscess requires immediate attention in order to minimize further spread of the infection. Any risk of infection while ''pregnant'' is a concern as the infection can be more severe in pregnant women or could harm the fetus.'  "
Are home remedies effective for an abscessed tooth?,"'Generally, ''oral health'' home remedies are not advised for an abscessed tooth. Home remedies can be used to temporarily alleviate symptoms such as warm saltwater or baking soda rinses, a warm moistened teabag compress over the area and taking ''over-the-counter'' analgesic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs''). However, the infection will still progress if not properly treated. Furthermore, avoiding treatment can lead to more serious complications. Seeking care and advice from a dental professional is strongly recommended as soon as possible.'  "
What specialists treat an abscessed tooth?,"'The treatment needed usually determines who will treat the abscessed tooth. For the most part, an abscessed tooth can be managed by a general dentist whether it is to clear an infection, perform the root canal procedure or extract the tooth if needed. Alternatively, a dental specialist called an endodontist can be consulted to treat the abscess and perform the root canal procedure. Another dental specialist, an ''oral surgeon'', can also treat an abscess and extract the tooth if tooth loss is inevitable. For children, a pediatric dentist can provide appropriate care for baby teeth to treat an abscessed tooth. Oral surgeons as well as emergency room and ENT physicians would treat more severe cases where the infection from an abscessed tooth has spread beyond the mouth area.' "
What is the prognosis for an abscessed tooth?,"'The prognosis depends on the extent of the spread of infection. Usually, when the infection is localized to the tooth, the prognosis is very good if treatment is sought as soon as signs and symptoms are noticed. If the infection affects much of the surrounding jawbone of the tooth and has caused the tooth to become loose, the chances of saving the tooth decrease.'  "
What is a dry socket?,"'The typical scenario for ''dry socket'' is the occurrence of throbbing pain about two to four days after the tooth is extracted. Dry socket pain is often accompanied by ''bad breath'' and a foul taste in the mouth. With this onset of pain, it is obvious that proper healing has been interrupted.''Dry socket is a condition of inflammation of the jawbone (or alveolar bone) after a tooth extraction. It is also referred to as ""''alveolar osteitis''"" and is one of the many complications that can occur from a tooth extraction. The hallmark of dry socket is noticeable pain that occurs a few days after a tooth is extracted. Pain from dry socket is often described as a dull, throbbing pain that can range from moderate to unbearable.' "
Is it possible to prevent an abscessed tooth?,"'Good oral health habits and regular dental visits can play a big role in preventing abscessed teeth. Time is also a big factor in whether a tooth is allowed to reach the point of infection. The longer the tooth sits untreated, the higher chance that infection can occur and spread to become an abscess. Once a decayed, fractured, or sensitive tooth is noticed, taking the preventive steps to fix it early will help prevent bigger problems such as an abscessed tooth.' "
Facts you should know about toothaches,"'A ''toothache'' is ''pain'' that occurs in or around a tooth. The ''pain'' originates from within a tooth or the surrounding gum and bone structures. One usually feels toothache pain as a constant or intermittent ache that does not go away. Temperature changes, such as exposure to ''cold'' ''drinks'' or pressure on the tooth while chewing, can stimulate a toothache. In other instances, ''tooth pain'' can arise spontaneously without any stimulation. ''Odontalgia'' is another name for a toothache.'""It's hard to ignore an aching tooth while eating or going about one's day. Persistent pain urges us to find out how to get rid of a toothache. While bothersome, it is a way for the painful tooth or area to signal that one should seek some attention and care from a dentist before things get worse.""  "
What causes a toothache?,"'Injury or ''trauma'' to the tooth or area usually cause toothaches. Injury is commonly a result of ''tooth decay'' (or ''cavity''). People usually feel ''cavities'"" when they get larger and deeper into the layers of tooth structure. Enamel is the hard, outer layer of tooth, and dentin is the softer layer beneath the enamel. Dentin is the tooth's sensitive layer with tiny microscopic tubes that originate from the very center of the tooth. The pulp chamber (the center of the tooth) contains the pulp. The pulp is comprised of blood vessels and nerves. If decay gets past enamel into the dentin, the ""'cavity'' can sometimes cause discomfort. A deeper cavity that approaches the center of the tooth will likely cause pain since there is more damage to the tooth and there is less tooth structure to insulate and protect the pulp. Localized infection between the gum and tooth (periodontal ''abscess'') can cause toothache. A traumatic physical blow to a tooth can induce a sore tooth, as well.''Other causes of toothache include the following:' Abscessed tooth: This infection originates from within the tooth and spreads to the root and the surrounding bone. Damaged or fractured tooth: Fracture of a tooth can expose the sensitive dentin or even the pulp. Sometimes fractures are not obvious even though the fracture line can run deep into the tooth, causing tooth pain every time one puts pressure on it with biting or chewing (called ""cracked tooth syndrome""). Dental work: After getting a filling or crown, the tooth can feel more sensitive. This is especially the case if the removal of tooth decay was large or deep. Dental work, although necessary, can sometimes irritate the nerve. Over time, the sensitivity can resolve if the tooth is healthy enough. Teeth clenching or grinding: This habit is called bruxism and is oftentimes done unconsciously and at night. Unfortunately, bruxism causes damage to teeth and sometimes irritates the nerves to the point where teeth become sensitive. Gum infection or gum disease: The periodontium consists of the gum, gum ligament, and bone that surround and anchor the teeth. Early stages of gum problems usually involve inflamed gum, called gingivitis. The gum is usually red, swollen and will bleed easily. A gum problem can progress to include the jawbone surrounding teeth and represents the later stages of gum disease (or ""periodontitis"") where there is advanced loss of bone around the teeth. Because of bone loss, a gum abscess (infection) can form in the space that develops between the tooth and the gum, causing pain. Exposed root surfaces: When the protective bone and gum no longer cover the roots of teeth, these surfaces can be sensitive to stimuli such as brushing the teeth or temperature changes. Sinusitis: Because the roots of the upper molars are very close to the maxillary sinus cavities, inflammation from the sinus cavities can cause these molars to be sensitive and feel like a toothache. Third molars (""wisdom teeth""): Third molars, also called wisdom teeth, are the very last permanent teeth to appear in the mouth. More often than not, there is not enough space for these molars in the mouth. As a result, third molars become fully or partially trapped (impacted) within the jawbone and below the gum. Because of poor accessibility, it is difficult to properly clean partially exposed third molars; therefore, these areas are susceptible to problems. Problems with third molars can cause dull to severe pain from pressure of eruption, gum infection, or dental decay."
What are toothache symptoms and signs?,"'Signs and symptoms that can might indicate a tooth problem are''A toothache can present as a dull or sharp pain that may arise spontaneously on its own or by stimulation.''Additional symptoms may include'   pain with biting or chewing, teeth hypersensitivity to changes in temperature, cheek or gums swelling near tooth, discharge or bleeding of gums, constant throbbing within a tooth. headache, neck pain, earache, fever, bad taste or odor in the mouth."
How do health care professionals diagnose a toothache?,"'The dentist performs a series of diagnostic tests along with ''dental X-rays'' to determine the origin of a toothache. These tests try to mimic what may be causing the pain, such as cold stimuli, biting or chewing pressure, and finger pressure on the gums. The response to a cold stimuli test can help in determining whether a tooth is vital (nerve is intact within tooth) or suffering from pulpitis (inflammation of the pulp). Determining duration and acuity of pain from cold stimuli can help diagnose and determine treatment.''Sometimes, the cause of a toothache may come from somewhere different from where pain is actually felt (called ""referred pain""). For these situations, diagnostic tests performed by the dentist are particularly important in accurately detecting the problem.' "
What is the treatment for a toothache?,"'Toothache treatment depends on the cause of the pain and how much damage is present. In general, the best way to stop a toothache is for the dentist to remove any present infection or decay and repair the damage to protect exposed, sensitive areas. For a shallow cavity on a tooth, a dentist removes the decay and seals the tooth with a filling. If the cavity is very deep and gets into the pulp, the dentist performs ""''root canal'' treatment"" because the pulp has been exposed and infected with bacteria. This procedure essentially removes all the vital contents of the tooth (nerves and blood vessels) and seals the inner aspects of the tooth (root canal system) with an inert filling material. An abscessed tooth that has very localized infection usually needs root canal treatment with antibiotic therapy. If the infection has become widespread, one may need antibiotic therapy and additional steps to properly drain the infection. Dentists often prescribe pain medications to manage the pain. Sometimes extraction of the tooth may be the only option for treatment if the tooth or surrounding gum and bone are too damaged.''For a periodontal abscess, a dentist performs a simple drainage procedure under local anesthesia. Additionally, a dentist thoroughly cleans the affected gum pocket to remove any tartar buildup and debris. Once cleaned, the pocket is irrigated with an antimicrobial rinse containing chlorhexidine. Sometimes, antibiotics are locally administered into the pocket to further aid in healing. Depending on the extent of the abscess, a dentist may prescribe oral antibiotics. Additionally, for the short-term, a dentist may prescribe chlorhexidine oral rinse as a mouthwash to aid in healing. The area should be kept clean with gentle tooth brushing and warm water rinses. A follow-up visit is recommended to make sure the infection has completely resolved and develop a plan to properly maintain the area.''For tooth fractures or cracked tooth syndrome situations, ''dental crown'' placement is the usual treatment. A crown will replace missing tooth structure and/or it will help protect the weakened tooth from further breakdown and sensitivity.'  "
Are home remedies effective for a toothache?,"'Generally, home remedies are only effective as a temporary measure to calm severe tooth pain and are not intended to cure the problem. How does one try to get instant relief without the aid of a dental professional? Oral pain medication will be a key step. ''Over-the-counter'' pain medicines such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') or ''naproxen'' (''Aleve'') are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' and are best taken on a schedule to provide pain relief. ''Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is an alternative painkiller. In some cases, alternating doses of ibuprofen and acetaminophen is effective.''The essential oil, clove oil, is a toothache remedy that is actually an ingredient in some sedative dental filling materials. It is a natural home remedy that has a numbing effect and can provide instant relief. Clove oil (eugenol) can be found at the pharmacy. Small amounts of clove oil should be used to the affected area. Dilute a few drops in a teaspoon of olive oil to avoid burning the mouth tissue. Before application of the diluted clove oil, rinse the mouth thoroughly with warm salt water or warm water to clear any debris from the affected area. Then, place a small cotton ball soaked with a few drops of the diluted clove oil on the tooth or gum area. Allow a few minutes after application for the numbing effect to take place. Other products that contain benzocaine (including Orajel or Anbesol) can temporarily numb the affected tooth or gums and provide pain relief as well. If clove oil is not available, plain olive oil can also provide some relief by coating a painful area.''To help a toothache until treatment can be found, one should avoid chewing on the affected tooth/area and minimize extreme temperatures of hot and cold. Keeping the area clean and free of food debris may help as well. Warm salt water or plain warm water rinses can help soothe the affected area and keep the mouth clean. If swelling of the surrounding gums or tissues is present, immediate treatment with a dentist or physician is advised to avoid the spread of infection. Home remedies may temporarily alleviate pain but do not to treat infection.''Above all, proper diagnosis and timely treatment by a dentist is strongly advised to effectively treat a toothache.'  "
How is a toothache treated in pregnancy?,"'Dentists can safely perform treatment during ''pregnancy'' as long as a few guidelines are followed.''Generally, if dental work is required to treat a toothache, the recommended time for treatment is during the ''second trimester'' of pregnancy. However, if there is a risk of infection or severe pain, dental treatment may need to be performed at any point during a pregnancy. The obstetrician is consulted on what would be the safest option to avoid any possible complications during dental treatment.''If a dental X-ray is needed, a lead apron is always used for every patient. For a ''pregnant'' patient, this is particularly important in protecting the unborn child.''Careful consideration should be made to ensure that any medications that are used are safe during pregnancy. This applies to local anesthetics administered during dental treatment and antibiotics (such as ''amoxicillin'' [''Amoxil'', ''Trimox'', ''Moxatag'', ''Larotid'']) taken before or after treatment. Over-the-counter drugs such as ''aspirin'', ibuprofen, or naproxen are avoided as these are not considered safe during pregnancy. Acetaminophen is considered safe for ''pain management''.'  "
What is the prognosis for a toothache?,"'For the most part, the prognosis is good for a toothache. In this era of modern dental care, dentists can quickly identify the problem and treat it effectively. The outcome is best when toothache is treated as early as possible to avoid further damage or risk of spreading infection.' "
Is it possible to prevent a toothache?,"'Conscientious efforts to practice good oral hygiene go a long way in preventing dental problems. Toothbrushing with fluoride ''toothpaste'' and use of dental floss are essential to good dental care at home. Furthermore, regular maintenance visits with a dentist can serve to keep things in check. Small cavities can be found before turning into larger cavities or an abscessed tooth. Gum problems, including periodontal abscess, can be addressed before advancing to a more diseased state.''To keep teeth strong, avoid the habit of chewing on ice or very hard foods that can cause tooth fractures. Using our teeth as a tool to open a bag of potato chips or cracking open a nutshell increase the chances of a tooth fracture as well. Minimize high ''sugar'' content foods or ''beverages'' to decrease the risk of dental decay. Be mindful of acidity in beverages as this can be a source of sensitivity and cavities for teeth.' "
Toothpaste basics,"'Toothpaste, also known as dentifrice, is available in paste, gel, or powder form. Despite the many types of toothpaste that exist, there are some ingredients common to most varieties. These include:' Abrasive agents. Scratchy materials, including calcium carbonate and silicates, help remove food, bacteria, and some stains from your teeth. Flavoring. Artificial sweeteners, including saccharin, are often added to toothpaste to make them taste better. While many people equate the flavor of toothpaste with mint, toothpaste is available in a variety of flavors, including cinnamon, lemon-lime, and even bubblegum (for kids -- or kids at heart). Humectants for moisture retention. Paste and gel formulations often contain substances like glycerol to prevent the toothpaste from drying out. Thickeners. Agents that add thickness to the toothpaste, including gums and gooey molecules found in some seaweeds, help achieve and maintain proper toothpaste texture. Detergents. Those suds you see when you brush your teeth are from detergents like sodium lauryl sulfate."
Fluoride toothpaste,"'The most important ingredient to look for when choosing toothpaste is fluoride.''Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral. Its use has been instrumental in the dramatic drop in ''tooth decay'' and ''cavity'' occurrence that has taken place over the past 50 years. Bacteria in your mouth feed on sugars and starches that remain on your teeth after eating. Fluoride helps protect your teeth from the acid that is released when this happens. It does this in two ways. First, fluoride makes your tooth enamel stronger and less likely to suffer acid damage. Second, it can reverse the early stages of acid damage by remineralizing areas that have started to decay.'""Using fluoride toothpaste is an important way to ensure that your teeth are reaping the benefits of this dental-friendly mineral. Don't think you can skip fluoride if you live in an area where the water is fluoridated. Studies have shown that using fluoride toothpaste helps increase the concentration of fluoride in the teeth, even in areas with water supplies containing high levels of the mineral."" "
Tartar control toothpaste,"'There are many tartar control toothpastes on the market, most of which contain fluoride.'""Everyone has a layer of bacteria on their teeth called plaque. If plaque isn't removed promptly with proper oral hygiene, it hardens into tartar. This hard-to-remove deposit can build up on your teeth and under your gums, ultimately leading to ""'gum disease''.''There are a variety of ingredients used in toothpaste to help prevent the accumulation of tartar on the teeth. Chemical compounds, including pyrophosphates and zinc citrate, are often added and have been proven effective. Additionally, some tartar control toothpastes contain an antibiotic called triclosan, which kills some of the bacteria in the mouth.''Certain toothpastes containing multiple anti-plaque agents in one formulation have been demonstrated to be even more effective at tartar control than varieties with only one plaque fighter.' "
Toothpastes for sensitive teeth,"'For people who have teeth that are easily ''irritated -- for'' instance, by hot or ''cold'' ''temperatures -- there'' are toothpastes available that are specially formulated for sensitive teeth. These toothpastes usually contain potassium nitrate or strontium chloride. These chemical compounds, which can take up to four weeks to offer relief, reduce tooth sensitivity by blocking pathways through the teeth that attach to nerves.' "
Whitening toothpaste,"'To help people on a quest for pearly whites, many whitening toothpastes are now being marketed for everyday use.''Whitening toothpastes do not typically contain bleaches. Instead, they contain abrasive particles or chemicals that effectively polish the teeth or bind to stains and help pull them off the tooth surface.''Although you might be concerned that the abrasiveness of whitening toothpaste could damage your teeth, studies suggest that whitening toothpastes are no harder on tooth enamel than other types of toothpaste.' "
Choosing the best toothpaste for you and your family,"""Here are some tips to help you choose the best toothpaste to meet your family's dental needs:""'With so many different options and combinations available, you can experiment with different brands, varieties, and flavors to find the best toothpaste for you.''WebMD Medical Reference''Sources:''    American Dental Association: ""ADA Seal of Acceptance Program.""''American Dental Association: ""Keeping Teeth Bright and Healthy.""''University of Maryland Medical Center: ""Oral Health: Brushing and Toothpaste.""''University of Maryland Medical Center: ""Oral Health: Fluoride.""''U.S. Food and Drug Administration: ""FDA Advises Consumers to Avoid Toothpaste From China Containing Harmful Chemical.""''Reviewed by Matthew Hoffman, MD, on July 10, 2008''© 2008 WebMD, LLC. All rights reserved.' 
Opt for ADA approval. Whatever your toothpaste needs, be sure to select toothpaste that has earned an American Dental Association seal of approval. Toothpastes that have earned this distinction have been evaluated for safety and effectiveness by an independent review board of scientific experts. All toothpastes earning the ADA seal contain fluoride -- the most important ingredient in any toothpaste.  
Be wary of imposters. In 2007, some toothpastes imported from China were found to contain a toxic substance, diethylene glycol. The FDA is currently advising against choosing toothpaste that says it was made in China.  
Consider your needs and the needs of your family members. As long as you select a fluoride-containing toothpaste, the best toothpaste is a matter of personal choice and preference. If you're committed to an all-natural lifestyle, you may want to opt for ADA-approved toothpastes that contain only natural ingredients. For people trying to instill good oral hygiene habits in your children, why not choose fruit-flavored toothpastes with sparkles to entice them to brush their teeth? Some people are eager to restore whiteness to their teeth with whitening toothpastes. Others like the feeling of brushing their teeth with toothpaste containing hydrogen peroxide or baking soda."
What is constipation? What causes it?,"   Constipation is a feeling of being unable to empty your bowels completely or regularly. A person is generally considered to have constipation if bowel movements are fewer than three times per week. Constipation is a common problem, and everyone experiences it occasionally. Symptoms of constipation include feeling unable to empty your bowels completely, stools appearing dry/hard/lumpy, stomach upset or cramps, bloating, and loss of appetite. There are numerous causes of constipation including diseases of the digestive system and side effects of medications, but for most people, a diet low in fiber may be the cause. There are many foods a person can eat to help relieve constipation, for example, kiwi, popcorn, nuts, flaxseed, berries, dried fruit, and broccoli. To prevent constipation, avoid foods that can make it worse, for example, bananas, gluten, caffeine, alcohol, and chewing gum. Here is a list of 12 foods to eat to help relieve constipation. When planning a healthy diet, it helps to include plenty of high-fiber choices to help you stay regular and provide relief of constipation."
1. Beans for constipation relief,"""Beans have more than 10 grams of fiber per cup serving that's more than almost any other fiber source. Beans have a great mixture of soluble and insoluble fiber, both of which helps the food keep moving through the ""'intestines'' to relieve constipation.''Take your pick:''Add any of these to salads, soups, casseroles, or pasta.' baked beans, black-eyed peas, garbanzo beans, lima beans, pinto beans, or kidney beans."
2. Kiwi for constipation relief," The luscious green flesh of the kiwi may be just what the doctor ordered for constipation relief. One medium kiwi has about 2.5 grams of fiber and lots of vitamins and nutrients that are important for good health, including the intestines. A kiwi is a berry. And like most berries, it has edible seeds. You can even eat the peel, although most people prefer to eat just the flesh. A 2013 study of adults reported in Advances in Food and Nutrition Research found that eating kiwi promotes regular bowel movements. A previous study by researchers in Taipei also found eating two kiwis a day increased the number of bowel movements in adults with constipation."
3. Sweet potatoes for constipation relief," One medium baked sweet potato with skin has 3.8 grams of fiber, which can help get things moving along. This high fiber content in sweet potatoes helps prevent and relieve constipation. The skin contains most of the fiber so leave it on for the biggest benefits. Regular baked potatoes are also a good source of fiber, with 3 grams in a small baked potato. Leave the skin on, and high-calorie toppings such as butter or sour cream off."
4. Popcorn for constipation relief,"'Stay away from movie theater popcorn or popcorn laden with butter as the high fat content not only contains lots of calories, the fat can cause constipation.' Air-popped popcorn is a good choice for a high-fiber snack that can help provide relief from constipation. A filling 3 cups of air-popped popcorn contains 3.5 g fiber, and less than 100 calories."
5. Nuts and seeds for constipation relief,"'Nuts are a filling food that is also packed with fiber to help ease constipation.''Remember that nuts and seeds are high in calories, so keep portions small. Choose nuts and seeds that are raw or dry roasted, rather than roasted in oil.' Almonds, pecans, and walnuts have more fiber than other nuts. Just 1 ounce of almonds (about 23 nuts) contains 3.5 g fiber, 1 ounce of pecans (about 19 halves) contains 2.7 g fiber, and 1 ounce of walnuts (14 halves) has 1.9 g fiber. Seeds are another good fiber-filled choice for constipation relief. A scant 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds contains 1.1 g fiber, while 1 ounce of pumpkin seeds (about 85 seeds) has a whopping 5 g fiber. Sprinkle seeds on top of salads for added fiber and crunch."
"7. Pears, plums, and apples for constipation relief"," With the skin, an average pear provides 5 to 6 grams of dietary fiber to regulate the digestive system. Pears also are great for babies with constipation. Look for baby foods with pears as an ingredient, and pear juice can also aid constipation in infants. Fresh plums do not have much fiber, but dried plums – prunes – have as many as 12 g fiber per cup and are excellent for relieving constipation. One large apple has more than 5 g fiber."
6. Whole grain bread for constipation relief,"'Whole grains have lots of fiber, which is a good choice not only for the bowels, but also the ''heart''.' Researchers at the University of Finland in Helsinki found whole grain rye bread to be better than wheat bread and laxatives for relieving constipation. They reported their findings in the Journal of Nutrition in 2010. Their subjects ate enough slices (12.3 grams each) to get 30 grams of fiber a day, but you don't have to eat that much for it to work. Arabinoxylan, the main component of dietary fiber in rye, helps keep food moving through the intestine. Ezekiel bread is another good choice for relief of constipation. It is bread made of sprouted whole grains and legumes, which provides a good dose of fiber and nutrients."
8. Berries for constipation relief," Berries are tasty and easy to eat so take your pick: raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries - all are easy to snack on and full of fiber. For example just ½ cup of raspberries contains 4 g fiber to help relieve constipation. Eat them alone as a snack, try them on salads, or puree and freeze them for a cool summertime dessert."
9. Flaxseed for constipation relief," Flaxseed (or flax seed) can help with constipation and is a great source of fiber, antioxidants, and omega-3 fatty acids. Just one tablespoon of both brown and golden flax seed has 2.8 g fiber, both soluble and insoluble. Most of the fiber is found in the husk of the flax seed, and ground flax seed is generally recommended for easier absorption of the fiber. It's easy to add flax seed to smoothies, on top of salads, or in oatmeal."
10. Broccoli for constipation relief," Just ½ cup of cooked broccoli contains 2.8 grams of fiber to aid with constipation relief, and it's also chock full of vitamin C. Broccoli makes a great side dish, and it can be eaten raw as a snack with hummus or a low-fat dip."
11. Dried fruit for constipation relief,"'Just remember that while dried fruit has more fiber than fresh fruit, it also has more calories.' Dried fruit is a smart choice if you're feeling constipated, as it actually contains more fiber than fresh fruit per serving. An easy snack is raisins, with 7 g fiber per cup (compared to 1 g in 1 cup of grapes). Aside from prunes, dried fruits such as figs, raisins, and dried apricots are excellent sources of fiber. Add dried fruit to cereal, or bake it into bran muffins. Soak it in water to soften it if it's hard to chew."
12. Prunes for constipation relief," Prunes were grandma's remedy. They could be yours, too. Prunes are high in insoluble fiber as well as the natural laxative sorbitol, which can help you ""go."" Researchers at the University of Iowa tested dried, pitted plums (prunes) against psyllium (a laxative) in 40 adults who were constipated. Those given the plums had measurably higher spontaneous bowel movements than those given the laxative. Prunes juice is also helpful at relieving constipation in babies."
What is the definition of constipation?,"'Constipation'' is a common problem where people find it difficult to have bowel movements. ''Constipation'' medically is defined as less than three bowel movements per week. If a person has less than one bowel movement per week, they are considered to have severe ''constipation''. Symptoms of ''bloating'', ''gas'', or ''pain'' passing bowel movements may accompany ''constipation''.'  "
What foods cause constipation?,"'Just as there are many foods you can eat to help prevent or relieve your ''constipation'', there are foods that can have a binding effect that can make your ''constipation'' worse. These are 16 foods to avoid when you are constipated.'  "
Bananas,"""Bananas are a conundrum when it comes to constipation foods to avoid. It's a matter of timing: Unripe bananas can cause constipation; ripe bananas can help relieve constipation.""'If someone is already dehydrated, this can make constipation worse.''Babies'' can also get constipated if they eat too many bananas. Moderation and a variety of fruits and veggies for your little one is the key.' Unripe or under-ripe green bananas cause constipation because they still have a lot of starch, which can be hard for the body to digest. Bananas also contain dietary fiber (pectin), which draws water from the intestines toward the stool."
Chewing gum,"'It is not true that if you swallow a piece of gum it takes seven years to digest. However, it is true that if you swallow many pieces of gum in a short time, or if you swallow several pieces of gum with other indigestible foods such as seeds, this can create a mass that in rare cases, blocks the digestive tract. This digestive blockage can cause constipation.''Children under age 5 should not chew gum at all, and if you do chew gum, stick to just one or two pieces a day -- and throw it out when you’re done chewing.' "
Caffeine,"'Like bananas, ''caffeine'' can go either way.' Caffeine is a stimulant that can make a person have more bowel stools or in excess, diarrhea. If a person is dehydrated, the caffeine in coffee, black tea, colas, and chocolate can make the constipation worse."
Gluten," Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Gluten doesn’t cause constipation in everyone but it can be problematic for some people who have sensitivity or allergies to it, or who have an autoimmune disorder called celiac disease. Those with celiac disease must avoid all gluten-containing products. If you think you have non-celiac gluten sensitivity and it may be causing your constipation, talk to your doctor. There are many gluten-free foods available to enjoy that can replace the breads and pastas that typically contain gluten."
White rice,"'White rice can cause constipation. There is a big difference between white rice and brown rice.' White rice can lead to constipation because the husk, bran, and germ  have been removed. That's where all the fiber and nutrients are! Brown rice can help relieve constipation because the husk, bran, and germ have not been removed. Brown rice is a good source of whole grains and contains about 3.5 g fiber and 5 grams of protein in 1 cup."
Persimmon," Persimmon is a fruit popular in Asia, though not as commonly known in the U.S. Sweet persimmons are usually OK, but more astringent persimmons contain high amounts of tannins, which can slow the movement of food through the intestines, and aggravate constipation. If you do eat persimmons, stick to the sweet variety."
Red meat,"'There are plenty of reasons to avoid red meat. Red meat can make a person constipated, and it can cause constipation for several reasons. Red meat:''Limit intake of red meat to avoid constipation.' Is high in fat, so it takes longer for the digestive tract to process it Has tough protein fibers that can be difficult for the stomach to digest Is rich in iron, which can be constipating"
White bread,"'While whole grain breads may help relieve constipation, white breads can cause or worsen it. This also applies to other products with a lot of white flour such as bagels, crackers, and pretzels. Unlike whole grains, white flour has no fiber. These foods are heavy on starch, and can back you up. Remember to choose whole grains.' "
Alcohol,"'Similar to ''caffeine'', ''alcohol'' also can contribute to constipation. For example, alcohol''Limit alcohol intake, and alternate one alcoholic beverage with a glass of water or even a sports drink (such as Gatorade or Powerade) in between each alcoholic drink.' is dehydrating, and it can slow digestion and irritate the bowel, which can worsen constipation symptoms."
Chocolate,"'Chocolate'' is a no-no, especially for people who suffer from ''irritable bowel syndrome'' (''IBS'').' It is thought that the large amount of fat in chocolate can slow the digestion process. It is believed this happens by slowing down muscle contractions (peristalsis) and thus slowing foods moving through the bowel. In one study, researchers in Germany asked people who had constipation to name the foods they thought caused it. Chocolate was mentioned most frequently."
Some supplements,"'Many people take iron and ''calcium supplements'' because they are trying to stay healthy, but the same ''supplements'' could be the cause of constipation. Ideally, a healthy, balanced ''diet'' should provide all of the nutrients a person needs. If your health care provider recommends you take these ''supplements'' (for example, people with ''anemia'' need iron, and women who are at risk for ''osteoporosis'' may need calcium) remember to add foods with additional fiber to your ''diet'' to help with constipation.' "
Dairy products,"'In large quantities, dairy products, such as milk, cheese, yogurt, and ice cream, can cause many people to become constipated. It could be due to the dairy itself or a combination of things. However, the lactose in dairy can cause increased ''gas'' and ''bloating'"" that can make a person feel even worse if things aren't moving through properly.""""One study of Iranian children, ages 1 to 13, found that dairy products could be the cause of their constipation. Almost all the children (80%) who eliminated cow's milk and milk products from their ""'diet'' had more regular bowel movements.' "
Fast food,"""All those burgers and fries are low-fiber and high in fat. Fried foods contribute to constipation. Not to mention fast foods often don't have much nutritional value on top of it.""'Instead of a fast food burger and fries try these:' Make burgers at home from lean ground turkey, or even better, try a veggie patty and put it on a whole grain wheat bun. Sweet potatoes are rich in soluble fiber, with plenty of nutrients, and help relieve and prevent constipation. So swap traditional French fries for baked sweet potato fries. Leave the skin on because it has the best fiber benefits!"
Processed foods and frozen dinners,"'Along with fast foods, processed foods contain little ''nutrition'' and usually a lot of fat. Many contain a lot of salt as well. Examples of foods to avoid include''All of these foods can cause constipation by slowing down the ''digestive system''. Try snacking on fruits and veggies and foods in their whole natural form, and make sure to drink enough water to help keep the ''digestive system'' working normally.' white bread, pastries, frozen meals, chips, and hot dogs."
Chips," Potato chips are tasty, but they are high in fat (foods high fat can slow digestion), low in fiber, and lack just about every other nutrient. Often people mindlessly snack on chips making themselves full. Instead, try snacking on raw veggies for a satisfying crunch that's from fiber-rich foods."
What is the function of the knee joint?,"'The purpose of the ''knee joint'' is to bend and straighten (flex and extend), allowing the body to change positions. The ability to bend at the knee makes activities like ''walking'', ''running'', jumping, standing, and sitting much easier and more efficient.''The thighbone (femur) and the shinbone (tibia) meet the kneecap (''patella'') to form the ''knee joint''. The rounded ends of the femur, or condyles, line up with the flat tops of the tibia called the plateaus. There are a variety of structures that hold the knee joint stable and allow the condyles and plateaus to maintain their anatomic relationship so that the knee can glide easily through its range of motion. The knee is a hinge joint, but there is also some rotation that occurs when it bends and straightens.''There are four thick bands of tissue, called ligaments, that stabilize the knee and keep its movement in one plane.''The major muscles of the thigh also act as stabilizers: the ''quadriceps'' in the front of the leg and the hamstrings in the back.''A sprain occurs when a ligament is injured and the fibers are either stretched or torn. A first-degree sprain is a ligament that is stretched but with no fibers torn, while a second-degree sprain is a partially torn ligament. A third-degree sprain is a completely torn ligament.' The medial collateral ligament (MCL) and the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) stabilize the sides of the knee preventing side-to-side buckling. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) form an X on the inside of the knee joint and prevent the knee from sliding back to front and front to back respectively."
What is a torn ACL?,"'A ''torn anterior cruciate ligament'' (ACL) is a second- or third-degree sprain of the ACL. The ACL arises from the front of the medial femoral condyle and passes through the middle of the knee to attach between the bony outcroppings (called the tibia spine) that are located between the tibia plateaus. It is a small structure, less than 1½ inches long and ½ inch wide. The anterior cruciate ligament is vital in preventing the thighbone (femur) from sliding backward on the tibia (or, from the other point of view, the tibia sliding forward under the femur). The ACL also stabilizes the knee from rotating, the motion that occurs when the foot is planted and the leg pivots.''Without a normal ACL, the knee becomes unstable and can buckle, especially when the leg is planted and attempts are made to stop or turn quickly.' "
What are symptoms and signs of a torn ACL?,"'With an acute injury, the patient often describes that they heard a loud pop and then developed intense ''pain'' in the knee. The ''pain'' makes ''walking'' or weight-bearing very difficult. The knee joint will begin to swell within a few hours because of bleeding within the joint, making it difficult to straighten the knee.''If left untreated, the knee will feel unstable and the patient may complain of recurrent ''pain'' and swelling and giving way, especially when ''walking'' on uneven ground or climbing up or down steps.'  "
What causes a torn ACL in men and women?,"'Most anterior cruciate ligament injuries occur due to injury, usually in a sport or ''fitness'' activity. The ligament gets stretched or tears when the foot is firmly planted and the knee locks and twists or pivots at the same time. This commonly occurs in basketball, football, soccer, and gymnastics, where a sudden change in direction stresses and damages the ligament. These injuries are usually noncontact, occur at low speed, and occur as the body is decelerating.''ACL injuries may also occur when the tibia is pushed forward in relation to the femur. This is the mechanism of injury that occurs because of a fall when skiing, from a direct blow to the front of the knee (such as in football) when the foot is planted on the ground, or in a car accident.''Women are more prone to ACL injuries than men. Women have slightly different anatomy that may put them at higher risk for ACL injuries:'   The intercondylar notch at the end of the femur is narrower in women than men. When the knee moves, this narrower space can pinch and weaken the ACL. Women have a wider pelvis than men, and this causes the femur to meet the tibia at a greater angle (called the Q angle). This increases the force that the ACL has to withstand with any twisting motion, increasing the risk of damage. Genetic differences may put the female ACL at risk. Female muscles tend to be more elastic and decrease the protection that the hamstring muscles can provide to the ACL. Hormonal changes during menses may also affect elasticity. Moreover, female hamstrings react and contract a millisecond slower than in a male, increasing the risk of ACL damage when landing from a jump."
What tests and procedures diagnose a torn ACL?,"'Televised sporting events have allowed the general public to watch how ''knee injuries'' occur, often repeatedly in slow-motion replay.''The diagnosis of an ACL injury begins with the care provider taking a history of how the injury occurred. Often the patient can describe in detail their body and leg position and the sequence of events just before, during, and after the injury as well as the angle of any impact.''Physical examination of the knee usually follows a relatively standard pattern.''It may be difficult to examine some patients when muscle strength or spasm can hide an injured ACL because of the knee stabilization that they can provide.''Plain ''X-rays'' of the knee may be done looking for broken bones. Other injuries that may mimic a ''torn ACL'' include ''fractures'' of the tibial plateau or tibial spines, where the ACL attaches. This second situation is often seen in children with ''knee injuries'', where the ligament fibers are stronger than the bones to which they are attached. In patients with an ACL tear, the ''X-rays'' are often normal.''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') has become the test of choice to image the knee looking for ligament injury. In addition to defining the injury, it can help the orthopedic surgeon help decide the best treatment options. However, ''MRI'' does not replace physical examination and many knee injuries do not require an ''MRI'' to confirm the diagnosis.'   The knee is examined for obvious swelling, bruising, and deformity. Areas of tenderness and subtle evidence of knee joint fluid (effusion) are noted. Most importantly, with knee injury ligamentous, stability is assessed. Since there are four ligaments at risk for injury, the examiner may try to test each to determine which one(s) is (are) potentially damaged. It is important to remember that a knee ligament injury might be an isolated structure damaged or there may be more than one ligament and other structures in the knee that are hurt. In the acute situation, with a painful, swollen joint, the initial examination may be difficult because both the pain and the fluid limit the patient's ability to cooperate and relax the leg. Spasm of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles often can make it difficult to assess ACL stability. A variety of maneuvers can be used to test the stability and strength of the ACL. These include the Lachman test, the pivot-shift test, and the anterior drawer test. Guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics suggest the Lachman test is best for assessing ACL tears. The Lachman test is performed as follows:The damaged knee is flexed to 20-30 degrees.The examiner grasps tibia and puts their thumb on the tibial tubercle (the bump of bone just below the knee where the patellar tendon attaches.The examiners other hand grasps the thigh just above the knee.The tibia is pulled forward and normally, there should be a firm stop if the ACL is intact. If the ligament is torn, the tibia will move forward and there will be no endpoint and it feels mushy. The damaged knee is flexed to 20-30 degrees. The examiner grasps tibia and puts their thumb on the tibial tubercle (the bump of bone just below the knee where the patellar tendon attaches. The examiners other hand grasps the thigh just above the knee. The tibia is pulled forward and normally, there should be a firm stop if the ACL is intact. If the ligament is torn, the tibia will move forward and there will be no endpoint and it feels mushy. The unaffected knee may be examined to be used as comparison."
How is a torn ACL treated? When does it need surgery?,"'The major decision in treating a torn ACL is whether the patient would benefit from surgery to repair the injury. The surgeon and the patient need to discuss the level of activity that was present before the injury, what the patient expects to do after the injury has healed, the general health of the patient, and whether the patient is willing to undertake the significant physical therapy and rehabilitation required after an operation.''Nonsurgical treatment may be appropriate for patients who are less active, do not participate in activities that require ''running'', jumping, or pivoting, and who would be interested in physical therapy to return range of motion and strength to match the uninjured leg.''The International Knee Documentation Committee, a collaboration of American and European orthopedic surgeons, developed a questionnaire to standardize the activity level assessment of patients before and after surgery to help guide surgeons and patients to decide whether surgery would be helpful. The activity levels were as follows:''Surgical repair is recommended for those who wish to return to Level I and II activities. This is generally not an emergency and is undertaken after a understanding all treatment options.''Young athletes may require surgical repair of the ACL because of the potential for knee instability and inability to return to their level of competition.''A nonsurgical approach might be considered for patients who have level III and level IV lifestyles.''Those who are candidates for nonoperative treatment benefit from physical therapy and ''exercise'' rehabilitation to return strength to the leg and range of motion to the injured knee. Even then, some patients might benefit from arthroscopic surgery to address associated cartilage damage and to debride or trim arthritic bony changes within the knee. Recovery from this type of arthroscopic surgery is measured in weeks, not months.''If surgery is planned, there is usually a waiting period of a few weeks after the injury so that pre-habilitation can occur to strengthen the muscles that surround the knee. The waiting period also decreases the risk of developing excess ''scar'' formation around the knee (arthrofibrosis) that might restrict knee motion after the operation.''Surgery is usually planned to occur within five months of injury.'""The anterior cruciate ligament can be reconstructed by an orthopedic surgeon using arthroscopic surgery. There are a variety of techniques, depending on the type of tear and what other injuries may be associated. The decision as to what surgical option is appropriate is individualized and tailored to a patient's specific situation. Because of its blood supply and other technical factors, the torn ACL ends are not usually sewn together and instead, a graft is used to replace the ACL. Often an autograft, tissue taken from the patient's own body, is a piece of hamstring or patellar tendon that is used to reconstruct the ACL.""'Research is ongoing about the potential role for biologic enhancements to the surgical repair, using ''stem cells'', platelet-rich plasma, and growth factors to help promote healing and ligament regeneration.''Rehabilitation physical therapy and ''exercise'' program is often suggested to strengthen the ''quadriceps'' and hamstrings before surgery. It may take six to nine months to return to full activity after surgery to reconstruct an ACL injury.''The first three weeks concentrate on gradually increasing knee range of motion in a controlled way. The new ligament needs time to heal and care is taken not to rip the graft. The goal is to have the knee capable of being fully extended and flexing to 90 degrees.''By week six, the knee should have full range of motion and a stationary bicycle or stair-climber can be used to maintain range of motion and begin strengthening exercises of the surrounding muscles.''The next four to six months is used to restore knee function to what it was before the injury. Strength, agility, and the ability to recognize the position of the knee are increased under the guidance of the physical therapist and surgeon. There is a balance between exercising too hard and not doing enough to rehabilitate the knee and the team approach of patient and therapist is useful.'   Level I: jumping, pivoting, and hard cutting Level II: heavy manual work or side-to-side sports Level III: light manual work and noncutting sports like running and bicycling Level IV: sedentary lifestyle without sports"
What is the recover time after torn ACL surgery?,'Rehabilitation and return to normal function after surgical repair of an ACL tear can take six to nine months. There needs to be a balance between trying to do too much work in physical therapy returning strength and range of motion and doing too little. Being too aggressive can damage the surgical repair and cause the ligament to fail again. Too little work lengthens the time to return to normal activities.'  
What is the prognosis of a torn ACL?,"'Most people who have surgery to repair their ACL have good return of function and lifestyle. Long-term success rates are reported between 82%-95%.''Fewer patients develop permanent knee instability. Up to 8% develop graft failure or instability.''For patients who do not have surgery to repair a torn ACL, only half have a fair outcome with no knee instability. This is an option for sedentary people or for those whose activities require no pivoting or cutting.' "
Can ACL tears be prevented?,"'ACL injuries usually occur in active people engaged in activities that are enjoyable. The risk of injury can potentially be decreased by maintaining muscle strength and flexibility. Warming up, stretching, and cooling down are ways of protecting joints and muscles.''Wearing ''braces'' to prevent injury may or may not be useful.''Strengthening exercises and agility drills can help prevent injury.''Plyometric exercises to help build power, strength, speed, and balance can teach the body how to jump and land properly to minimize the risk of injury, especially in women. It is important to avoid landing on a fully extended and locked leg.' "
Which types of doctor treats torn ACL injuries?,"'The diagnosis of an ACL tear may be made by emergency physicians, primary care providers, sports-medicine providers, and/or orthopedic surgeons.''Once the diagnosis is made, referral is often made to an orthopedic surgeon who would discuss the potential risks and benefits of surgery and other options. The orthopedic specialist would be the one to perform the surgery.''After the operation, a physical therapist under the direction of the orthopedic surgeon, would work with the patient to return them to normal activity.''If no surgery is planned, the primary care provider or the orthopedic surgeon could direct care in association with a physical therapist.''Anti-inflammatory medications, such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil''), ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), or ''ketorolac'' (''Toradol''), may be suggested to decrease swelling and ''pain''. ''Narcotic'' medications for pain, such as ''codeine'' or ''hydrocodone'' (''Vicodin'', ''Lortab''), may be prescribed for a short period of time after the acute injury and again after surgery.' "
Introduction to the knee,"'The knee is the largest joint in the body. The knee allows the leg to bend where the femur (thighbone) attaches to the tibia (shinbone). The knee flexes and extends, allowing the body to perform many activities, from walking and running to climbing and squatting. There are a variety of structures that surround the knee and allow it to bend and that protect the knee joint from injury.''The ''quadriceps'"" and hamstring muscles are responsible for moving the knee joint. When the quadriceps muscles (located on the front the thigh) contract, the knee extends or straightens. The hamstring muscles, located on the back of the thigh, are responsible for flexing or bending the knee. These muscles are also important in protecting the knee from being injured by acting to stabilize the knee and preventing it from being pushed in directions that it isn't meant to go.""'There are four ligaments that also stabilize the knee joint at rest and during movement: the medical and lateral collateral ligaments (MCL, LCL) and the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL, PCL).''Cartilage within the joint provides the cushioning to protect the bones from the routine stresses of walking, running, and climbing. The medial and lateral meniscus are two thicker wedge-shaped pads of cartilage attached to top of the tibia (shin bone), called the tibial plateau. Each meniscus is curved in a C-shape, with the front part of the cartilage called the anterior horn and the back part called the posterior horn.''There is also articular cartilage that lines the joint surfaces of the bones within the knee, including the tibia, femur, and kneecap (''patella''). The terminology ''torn knee cartilage'' refers to damage to one of the C-shaped menisci of the knee between the femur and tibia.''As with any injury in the body, when the meniscus is damaged, irritation occurs. If the surface that allows the bones to glide over each other in the knee joint is no longer smooth, ''pain'' can occur with each flexion or extension. The meniscus can be damaged because of a single event or it can gradually wear out because of age and overuse, causing degenerative tears.' "
What is a torn meniscus?,"'A torn meniscus is damage from a tear in the cartilage that is positioned on top of the tibia to allows the femur to glide when the knee joint moves. Tears are usually described by where they are located anatomically in the C shape and by their appearance (for example, ""bucket handle"" tear, longitudinal, parrot beak, and transverse). While physical examination may predict whether it is the medial or lateral meniscus that is damaged, a diagnostic procedure, like an ''MRI'' or arthroscopic surgery, can locate the specific part of the cartilage anatomy that is torn and its appearance.''Because the blood supply is different to each part of the meniscus, knowing where the tear is located may help decide how easily an injury might heal (with or without surgery). The better the blood supply, the better the potential for recovery. The outside rim of cartilage has better blood supply than the central part of the ""C."" Blood supply to knee cartilage also decreases with age, and up to 20% of normal blood supply is lost by age 40.' "
What causes a meniscus to tear?,"'A forceful twist or sudden stop can cause the end of the femur to grind into the top of the tibia, pinching and potentially tearing the cartilage of the meniscus. This ''knee injury'' can also occur with deep squatting or kneeling, especially when lifting a heavy weight. Meniscus tear injuries often occur during athletic activities, especially in contact sports like football and hockey. Motions that require pivoting and sudden stops, in sports like tennis, basketball, and golf, can also cause meniscus damage. The sports injury does not have to occur during a game but can also occur in practice, where the same motions lead to meniscus damage.''The risk of developing a torn meniscus increases with age because cartilage begins to gradually wear out, losing its blood supply and its resilience. Increasing body weight also puts more ''stress'' on the meniscus. Routine daily activities like walking and climbing stairs increase the potential for wear, degeneration, and tearing. It is estimated that six out of 10 patients older than 65 years have a degenerative meniscus tear. Many of these tears may never cause problems.''Because some of the fibers of the cartilage are interconnected with those of the ligaments that surround the knee, meniscus injuries may be associated with tears of the collateral and cruciate ligaments, depending upon the mechanism of injury.''While the normal cartilage is ""C"" or crescent shaped, there is a variant shape that is oval or discoid. This meniscus is thicker and more prone to injury and tearing.' "
What are symptoms and signs of a torn meniscus?,"'Very often, meniscal tears do not cause symptoms or problems. However, some people with a torn meniscus know exactly when they hurt their knee. There may be acute onset of ''knee pain'' and the patient may actually hear or feel a pop in their knee. As with any injury, there is an inflammatory response, including ''pain'' and swelling. The swelling within the knee joint from a torn meniscus usually takes a few hours to develop, and depending upon the amount of pain and fluid accumulation, the knee may become difficult to move. When fluid accumulates within the enclosed area of the knee joint, it may be difficult and painful to fully extend or straighten the knee, since the knee has the most space available when it is about 15 degrees flexed.'""In some situations, the amount of swelling may not necessarily be enough to notice. Sometimes, the patient isn't aware of the initial injury but starts noting symptoms that develop later. Moreover, there may not be an acute injury. The knee cartilage may become damaged as a consequence of ""'aging'', ''arthritis'', and wearing away of the meniscus causing a degenerative meniscal tear.''After the injury, the knee joint irritation may gradually settle down and feel relatively normal as the initial inflammatory response resolves. However, other symptoms may develop over time and may include any or all of the following:'   Pain with running or walking longer distances Intermittent swelling of the knee joint: Many times, the knee with a torn meniscus feels ""tight."" Popping, especially when climbing up or down stairs Giving way or buckling (the sensation that the knee is unstable and the feeling that the knee will give way): Less commonly, the knee actually will give way and cause the patient to fall. Locking (a mechanical block where the knee cannot be fully extended or straightened): This occurs when a piece of torn meniscus folds on itself and blocks full range of motion of the knee joint. The knee gets ""stuck,"" usually flexed between 15 and 30 degrees and cannot bend or straighten from that position."
How do doctors diagnose a meniscus tear?,"'The diagnosis of a knee injury begins with the history and physical examination. If there is an acute injury, the doctor will ask about the mechanism of that injury to help understand the stresses that were placed on the knee. With chronic knee complaints, the initial injury may not be remembered, but many patients who participate in athletic events or training can pinpoint the specific timing and details of the injury. Non-athletes may remember a twist or deep bend at work or doing chores around the house.''There is a true art to the physical examination of the knee. From inspecting (looking), palpating (feeling), and applying specific diagnostic maneuvers, the doctor, trainer, or physical therapist may often make the diagnosis of a torn meniscus.''Physical examination often includes palpating the joint for warmth and areas of tenderness, assessing the stability of the ligaments, and testing the range of motion of the knee joint and the power of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles. There have been many tests described to assess the internal structures of the knee. The McMurray test, named after a British orthopedic surgeon, has been used for more than 100 years to make the clinical diagnosis of a torn meniscus. The health care professional flexes the knee and rotates the tibia while feeling along the joint. The test is positive for a potential tear if a click is felt.''Magnetic resonance imaging'' (MRI) is the test of choice to confirm the diagnosis of a torn meniscus. It is a noninvasive test that can visualize the inner structures of the knee, including the cartilage and ligaments, the surface of the bones, and the muscles and tendons that surround the knee joint. One additional benefit of the MRI before surgery is that by knowing the anatomy the orthopedic surgeon can plan a potential knee surgery and discuss alternative treatments with the patient before the operation begins.''Plain ''X-rays'' cannot be used to identify meniscal tears but may be helpful in looking for bony changes, including ''fractures'', arthritis, and loose bony fragments within the joint. In older patients, X-rays may be taken of both knees while the patient is standing. This allows the joint spaces to be compared to assess the degree of cartilage wear. Cartilage takes up space within the joint and if the joint space is narrowed, it may be an indicator that there is less cartilage present, likely from degenerative disease. Plain X-rays may also uncover other causes of knee pain, including arthritis and ''pseudogout''.''Prior to the widespread use of MRI, knee ''arthroscopy'' was used to confirm the diagnosis of a torn meniscus. In arthroscopy, the orthopedic surgeon inserts a small scope into the knee and looks directly at the structures within the joint. The added benefit of arthroscopy is that the injury may be repaired at the same time using additional tools that are inserted into the joint. The disadvantage of arthroscopy is that it is a surgical procedure with all the potential risks that are associated with surgery.' "
What types of doctors treat a torn meniscus?,"'The diagnosis of a torn meniscus may be made by a primary care provider with the patient is often referred to an orthopedic surgeon to either help with the diagnosis or to help with treatment decisions.''While many types of health care providers can diagnose and treat a torn meniscus, it is an orthopedic surgeon who would perform the arthoscopic surgery. For those who do not need, or choose not to have surgery, their primary care provider, the orthopedic surgeon, or a sports-medicine specialist may continue care. Often a physical therapist is involved, whether or not meniscus surgery is part of the treatment.' "
What is the treatment for a torn meniscus?,"'The treatment of a meniscus tear depends on its severity, location, and underlying disease within the knee joint. Patient circumstances also may affect the treatment options. Often it is possible to treat meniscus tears conservatively without an operation using anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy rehabilitation to strengthen muscles around the knee to prevent joint instability. Frequently, that is all a patient needs. Patients involved in sport or whose work is physically demanding may require immediate surgery to continue their activity. Most patients fall in between the two extremes, and the decision to use conservative treatments or proceed with an operation needs to be individualized.''The first steps in treatment after the acute injury usually include rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). This may be helpful in easing the inflammation that occurs with a torn meniscus. Anti-inflammatory medications, such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin'') or ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), may help relieve pain and inflammation. It is important to remember that ''over-the-counter'"" medications can have side effects and interactions with prescription medications. It is reasonable to ask a health care professional or pharmacist for directions as to which over-the-counter medication might be best for someone's particular situation. Rest and elevation may also require the use of crutches to limit weight-bearing.""'A brace is often not used initially because most hold the knee in full extension (completely straight) and this can worsen the pain by decreasing the space within the knee joint capable of accommodating any fluid or swelling. Many patients choose initial conservative or nonsurgical treatment for a meniscus tear. Once the injury symptoms have calmed, the health care professional may recommend specifically guided ''exercise'' programs; physical therapists are especially helpful, to strengthen the muscles surrounding the knee and add to the stability of the joint. Maintaining an ideal body weight will also help lessen the forces that can ''stress'' the knee joint. Shoe orthotics may be useful to distribute the forces generated by walking and running. ''Braces'' tend not to be effective because the meniscus injury does not cause the knee joint to become structurally unstable.''If conservative therapy fails, surgery may be a consideration. Knee arthroscopy allows the orthopedic surgeon to assess the cartilage tear and potentially repair it. During an operation, the goal is to preserve as much cartilage as possible. Procedures include meniscal repair (sewing the torn edges together), partial meniscectomy (trimming away the torn area, and smoothing the injury site), or total meniscectomy, removing the whole meniscus if that is deemed appropriate.''Microfracture surgery is another surgical option to stimulate new cartilage growth. Small holes are drilled into the surface of the bone and this can stimulate articular but not meniscus cartilage development. The articular cartilage that grows as a result of surgery is not as thick or as strong as the original meniscus cartilage.''In older patients with ''degenerative joint disease'' (also known as ''osteoarthritis'') where the cartilage wears out, treatment options may be considered over a longer timetable.''Exercise'' and muscle strengthening may be an option to protect the joint and maintain range of motion. As well, anti-inflammatory medications may be considered to decrease swelling and pain arising from the knee joint.''Cortisone medication injections into the knee joint may be used to decrease ''joint inflammation'' and to bring temporary symptom relief that can last weeks or months. A variety of hyaluronan preparations are approved for mild to moderate knee ''degenerative arthritis'' and include ''hylan G-F 20'' (''Synvisc''), sodium hyaluronate injection (Euflexxa, ''Hyalgan''), and hyaluronan (Orthovisc).''Other injection options are being investigated to help regrow or repair meniscus injuries. Platelet rich plasma and stem cell injections are potential alternative treatment options to knee arthroscopy surgery, however, consensus does not yet exist that the treatments are effective. There are ongoing studies to assess whether or not they can be effective in treating knee meniscus injury instead of, or in conjunction with, arthroscopic surgery.''The use of ''dietary supplements'', including chondroitin and ''glucosamine'', have yet to have their effectiveness proven, but many people find relief with their use.''As a last resort, joint replacement may be an option for patients who have substantial degeneration of the knee with worn out cartilage. These individuals typically have recurrent or constant pain and limited range of motion of the knee, preventing them from performing routine daily activities.'  "
Can a meniscus tear heal without surgery?,"'Injuries that occur in parts of the cartilage that have better blood supply have a better chance to heal than those where there is little blood supply. With meniscal injuries, if the knee is stable and if the symptoms do not persist and do not limit lifestyle, nonsurgical treatments remain an option. However, the decision to defer surgery depends upon whether the knee joint remains functional and allows the patient to participate in their preferred activities.'  "
What is rehabilitation and recovery like for a patient with a meniscus tear?,"'If a conservative, nonsurgical approach is taken, the pain and swelling of a torn meniscus should resolve within a few days. Recovery and rehabilitation becomes a long-term commitment, as does making certain that the muscles surrounding the knee are kept strong to promote joint stability. Maintaining an ideal body weight, and avoiding activities that cause pain are adjuncts that are often recommended.''If knee arthroscopy is performed, the rehabilitation process balances swelling and healing. The goal is to return range of motion to the knee as soon as possible. Physical therapy is an important part of the surgery process, and most therapists work with the orthopedic surgeon to return the patient to full function as soon as possible. Since the procedure usually is planned in advance, some health care professionals advocate pre-hab. With rehabilitation prior to the procedure, the patient begins strengthening exercises for the quadriceps and hamstring muscles before surgery to prevent the routine muscle ''weakness'' that may occur immediately after an operation.''After surgery, once the swelling in the knee joint resolves, the goal of therapy is to increase the strength of the muscles surrounding the knee, return range of motion to normal, and promote and preserve stability of the joint.''Elite athletes return to practice within one to two weeks after surgery, but they are a motivated group of people who spend hours each day in rehabilitation. For most other patients, return to mild routine activity occurs in less than six weeks.''Most patients do well after surgery. The prognosis for return to normal activity is good but depends upon the motivation of the patient to work hard with their physical therapist and to continue that work at home after formal therapy has been completed.' "
What are recommended exercises once a torn meniscus has been repaired?,'Rehabilitation after an operation depends upon the individual patient and the response to surgery. Specific recommendations regarding weight-bearing and exercises will be customized for the patient by the surgeon and therapist.''Usually the goal is to return the knee to normal function within four to six weeks.' 
What is the prognosis of a torn meniscus? Is it possible to prevent a torn meniscus?,"'Most patients have their goals met by either conservative or surgical treatment, meaning that they are able to return to a normal level of function. This even includes both elite and recreational athletes who are able to return and compete in their sports.''Complications may occur during surgery. For meniscectomy, where the damaged cartilage is surgically removed, the rate of complication is less than 2%. This includes anesthetic complications, infection, and failure to prevent long-term ''stiffness'', swelling, and recurrent pain. Other complications include ''deep vein thrombosis'' (''blood clots'' in the leg) and the associated risks of the anesthetic. In patients who undergo meniscus repair, complications can occur in up to one-third of patients.''Once cartilage is damaged, it cannot be repaired to be as good as the original. For that reason, ''prevention'' may actually be the best treatment for a torn meniscus. A lifelong commitment to maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding injury will decrease the stress placed on the cartilage of the knee during daily activities. Keeping muscles strong and flexible will also help protect joints. For the knee, this includes not only the quadriceps and hamstring muscles but also those in the core and back.' "
What are the testicles? What do they look like (pictures)?,"'The testicles form part of the male reproductive organs, with a primary function of producing sperm and the male hormone testosterone.' Testicles are contained within an external sac-like structure called the scrotum, which is located between the penis and the anus. Adult testicles are about the size two large olives. It is common for one testicle to hang lower than the other within the scrotum. Located near the back of each testicle lies the epididymis, which is a coiled tubular structure that functions to store and transport sperm. A tubular structure containing blood vessels, nerves, lymphatic vessels and the vas deferens called the spermatic cord courses from the abdomen and is connected to each testicle. Apart from containing vital structures for each testicle, the spermatic cord also suspends the testicles within the scrotum."
What does testicular pain feel like? How severe is the pain?,"'Testicular pain is pain or discomfort that is felt in one or both testicles. The pain may originate from the testicle itself, or it may be the result of other conditions affecting the scrotum, groin, or abdomen. Though there are numerous medical conditions that can cause testicular pain, it is important to understand that a few of them constitute medical emergencies that require immediate medical attention in order to prevent impairment or loss of testicular function. Testicular pain can be an acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) condition. The testicular pain may be constant or intermittent.' "
What causes testicular pain? What are other symptoms of pain in the testicles?,"'Many diseases and other health problems can cause pain in one or both testicles. Testicular pain along with other symptoms and signs vary depending on the underlying cause. However, often times the symptoms can be very similar between the various causes, making it difficult to distinguish among the conditions which require urgent medical attention. ''Therefore, if you experience testicular pain, call your doctor immediately or go to the nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department. '  "
"Testicular torsion causes, symptoms, and signs","'Testicular torsion typically occurs because of an anomaly affecting the normal attachment of the testicle within the scrotum, often referred to as the ""bell clapper"" deformity. This abnormality allows the testicle to be freely suspended and twist spontaneously. Often times, this anomaly is present in both testicles. Trauma to the testicle is a rare cause of testicular torsion.''Testicular torsion is most common in males younger than 30 years of age, with a peak incidence between 12 to 18 years of age. It can also occur more frequently during the ''neonatal'' period. Testicular torsion most often affects the left testicle, and it is the most common cause of testicle loss in adolescent males.''Testicular torsion generally comes on suddenly. Severe testicle pain that is only felt in one testicle may also have these signs and symptoms:' Nausea and vomiting Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness Testicular and/or scrotal swelling and redness Abdominal pain Fever Elevation of the affected testicle within the scrotum Horizontal positioning of the affected testicle within the scrotum Loss of the cremasteric reflex on the affected side (normally, the testicle elevates with light stroking of the upper inner thigh area)."
"Epididymitis causes, symptoms, and signs","'Epididymitis occurs when there is inflammation of the epididymis (a structure within the scrotum). Generally, the condition is result of an infection. Epididymitis primarily affects adult men, and is most common between the ages of 19 to 40 years; however, it can occur in prepubescent boys and elderly men.''Sexually transmitted diseases or ''STDs'' that are most commonly caused by the bacteria ''Chlamydia trachomatis'' and ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' are the most common cause of epididymitis in sexually active men. In younger and older males, the infection usually is caused by bacteria such as ''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli'') that are found in the urinary tract. Infection in these age groups is typically the result of an abnormality within the genitourinary system.''Epididymitis comes on gradually. The testicular pain can be mild, moderate, or severe, and only in one testicle. Epididymitis also may have symptoms and signs including:' Nausea and vomiting Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, typically localized to the area of the epididymis, though it can become more generalized and involve the whole testicle as the illness progresses Testicular and/or scrotal swelling and redness Abdominal pain Fever Urethral discharge Urinary symptoms, such as burning, urgency, or frequency"
"Inguinal hernia causes, symptoms, and signs","'An ''inguinal hernia'' is a bulge or protrusion of intestine through a defect in the abdominal wall musculature of the groin area. This protrusion can sometimes cause ''swelling of the scrotum'' and subsequent testicular pain.''Inguinal hernias are common and they can sometimes cause discomfort in the scrotum and/or testicles. Signs and symptoms of an inguinal ''hernia'' may include a:' Bulge in the scrotum or in the inguinal area, that may become more pronounced with coughing or straining; and Dull ache or burning sensation in the scrotum and/or testicles."
"Testicular tumor causes, symptoms, and signs","""Generally, testicular tumors don't cause pain; however, occasionally some tumors can cause pain and discomfort of the testicle or scrotum. Signs and symptoms of a tumor in a testicle may include a:"" Lump or mass of the testicle Change in the size or texture of the testicle Dull ache of the lower abdomen, lower back or groin area Feeling of heaviness in the scrotum"
"Orchitis causes, symptoms, and signs","'Orchitis is a sign of inflammation of a testicle, usually because of an infection, for example, the mumps, the most common cause of the condition. Usually, mumps orchitis occurs in males who have not reached ''puberty''; however, there has been an increase in cases in boys who have gone through puberty and adolescent males, secondary to the decreased use of the mumps ''vaccine''. Rarely, orchitis can be caused by a bacterial infection that, usually, is the result of progression of epididymitis (epididymo-orchitis).''Because orchitis generally occurs as a consequence of an infection (most often mumps), it is typically also accompanied by other systemic infectious symptoms. Testicular pain may range from mild to severe. Signs and symptoms of orchitis may include:' Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, swelling or redness Fever and chills Headache Body aches Nausea Fatigue Parotid gland inflammation (parotitis) in cases of mumps"
"Trauma and injury causes, symptoms, and signs","'Trauma or injury of any type to the testicles can cause severe pain and discomfort. Blunt testicular trauma (around 85%) is the most common cause of testicle pain. Examples of causes of injuries to the testicle include sports injuries, a direct kick to the groin or testicle, car accidents, and straddle injuries. Usually, the pain improves with time. Rarely, trauma to the testicles can cause more severe injuries requiring immediate medical attention.''The testicular pain may range from severe to absent at the time the person sees a doctor. Rarely however, the injury may seem minor, but there may be a serious underlying injury to the testicle.''Other symptoms and signs of trauma or injury to a testicle include:' Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, swelling or bruising Bruising of the area between the scrotum and the anus (perineum) Nausea and vomiting"
"Testicle rupture causes, symptoms, and signs","'Testicle rupture is a serious injury that is a result of a disruption to the connective tissue enveloping the testicle (tunica albuginea), which then causes extrusion of testicular tissue. Often, a sign of testicular rupture is a blood collection (hematocele) that surrounds the testicle.''Other types of injuries that cause testicular rupture include penetrating trauma and testicular dislocation. These types of testicular injuries typically require surgery.' "
"Torsion of a testicular appendage cause, symptoms, and signs","'Torsion of a testicular appendage occurs due to twisting (torsion) of the testicular or epididymal appendage, which are functionless structures that are remnants of tissue from human development. The testicular appendage lies between the testicle and the epididymis, while the epididymal appendage typically projects from the epididymis. As with testicular torsion, twisting of these structures leads to a decrease in blood flow and subsequent testicular pain. This is a common condition in younger boys, with most cases occurring between 7 to 14 years of age. Though this condition is benign and self-limiting, it must be distinguished from the more serious testicular torsion.''With torsion of a testicular appendage, the onset of testicle pain may be sudden or gradual, and the severity of pain may range from mild to severe. Generally, a person has no symptoms or signs like nausea, vomiting, and fever.''The testicle and/or scrotum generally appear normal, without swelling and redness; however, other symptoms and signs may include:''Preservation of the normal vertical positioning of the affected testicle within the scrotum, and preservation of the cremasteric reflex is generally maintained.' Testicular tenderness, typically only localized to the top of the right or left testicle. Sometimes, a small blue-dot is visualized near the top of the affected testicle (blue-dot sign)."
Can kidney stones cause testicular pain and other symptoms and signs?,"'Occasionally, the pain associated with kidney stones can radiate into the groin area and cause testicular pain. However, the testicles appear normal with no swelling or redness. Other signs and symptoms of kidney stones may include:' Back (flank) pain and tenderness Abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Urinary symptoms, such as blood in the urine, discomfort with urination and urinary frequency"
How are the causes of testicular pain diagnosed?,"""In order to diagnose the underlying condition causing testicular pain, a health care professional will perform a complete history and physical exam. Laboratory testing and imaging studies may also be ordered depending on the health care professional's initial impression and evaluation.""'Laboratory testing may include:''Imaging studies may be ordered by your health care professional to further delineate the underlying cause of the testicular pain. In certain patients with testicular pain whose symptoms are strongly suggestive of testicular torsion, immediate urologic consultation prior to testing should be obtained in order to prevent potential delays in definitive surgical management.''A color Doppler testicular ''ultrasound'' is a noninvasive imaging study that can evaluate the blood flow to the testicles, as well as the presence of testicular tumors, fluid collections, testicular rupture, and hernias. A kidney ultrasound can be helpful in the evaluation of kidney stones.''This is an imaging study requiring the intravenous administration of a radionuclide, useful for the evaluation of testicular torsion, as well as other causes of testicular pain. It is used much less commonly than ultrasound.''CT scan'' or a kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) X-ray ''These particular imaging studies are sometimes ordered if there is a suspicion that the testicular pain is being caused by kidney stones or other conditions in the abdomen or pelvis.' Blood work Urinalysis A swab of the urethra (if the patient has penile discharge suggestive of a sexually transmitted disease)"
What is the treatment for testicular pain?,"'The treatment for testicular pain varies depending on the underlying cause. As already noted, some conditions causing testicular pain are medical emergencies requiring immediate surgical intervention.''The treatment of uncomplicated epididymitis can generally be managed as an outpatient, and consists of the following treatment measures:''In general, acute epididymitis that is properly treated resolves without complications. However, in some cases of epididymitis, such as those associated with serious systemic symptoms or in those accompanied by various complications, hospitalization may be necessary. A urologist will be consulted in these more serious cases.''The treatment for torsion of the testicular or epididymal appendage is directed toward relief of symptoms, and consists of the following measures:''Most patients improve with these treatment measures within 1 week, though symptoms may last longer. In cases of testicular pain refractory to conservative management, surgical excision of the affected tissue is considered.''The treatment for kidney stones generally depends on the location of the ''kidney stone'', the size of the ''kidney stone'', and any associated complications, such as infection. An uncomplicated kidney stone can typically be treated with the following measures:''Several different measures exist for treating kidney stones that do not pass spontaneously, such as ''lithotripsy'' (the use of ''shock'' waves to break up the kidney stone) and other more invasive surgical procedures.''Certain patients with intractable pain, intractable vomiting or those with signs of infection require hospitalization. In those with ''urinary tract infection'' and an obstruction in the genitourinary system, antibiotics and emergent urologic intervention are necessary.''The treatment and management of testicular trauma depends on the severity of injury. Minor cases of testicular trauma without suspected serious underlying testicular injury can be managed as an outpatient with the following measures:''With testicular rupture, immediate surgical repair is necessary to preserve testicular function and viability. Other situations requiring surgical management include certain blunt trauma injuries with associated blood collections (hematoceles), penetrating trauma, and certain cases of testicular dislocation.''The treatment of orchitis depends on the infectious organism responsible for causing the testicular inflammation. Both viral and bacterial orchitis can be treated with the following measures:''Bacterial orchitis and epididymo-orchitis require antibiotics. Those cases caused by ''viruses'' do not require antibiotics.'   Definitive management of testicular torsion requires surgery by a urologist. During surgery, the affected testicle is untwisted, and if it is viable, the testicle is secured to the scrotal wall (orchiopexy). The unaffected testicle may also be secured to prevent testicular torsion from occurring, as some males will have the bell clapper abnormality on both sides. Sometimes, the affected testicle can be manually untwisted by a doctor without necessitating emergent surgery, though this is a temporizing measure that ultimately still requires definitive surgical repair. Likewise, some cases of testicular torsion can occur and then resolve spontaneously, and the health care professional must maintain a high index of suspicion in order for this condition to be diagnosed and ultimately surgically repaired. The more rapidly the testicle is untwisted and blood flow is restored, the better the chances for salvaging the affected testicle. If treated within 6 hours of symptom onset, the salvage rate nears 100%, while after 24 hours the salvage rate is between 0% and 10%. Antibiotics (which may vary depending on the patient's age and sexual history), pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs Adequate fluid intake Pain medication Anti- nausea medication In some instances medications such as tamsulosin (Flomax), which may facilitate the passage of kidney stones The treatment for a testicular tumor depends on various factors. A testicular mass is considered cancer until proven otherwise. If testicular cancer is diagnosed, patients are referred to an oncologist who will discuss the different treatment options available. Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs The definitive treatment of inguinal hernias requires surgical repair, sometimes electively as an outpatient, while others require intervention on a more emergent basis. Occasionally, inguinal hernias may not be repaired even electively because a patient is too high-risk to undergo surgery. Prompt surgical intervention is necessary in cases of inguinal hernias that are not reducible (unable to be pushed back into the abdomen) and in those cases of strangulation (disruption to the blood supply of the intestine). Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs"
What are the complications of causes of testicular pain?,"'The complications associated with the different causes of testicular pain are varied. Some individuals may suffer from chronic testicular pain, even after the acute cause of the testicular pain has been treated. Other potential complications may include:'   Permanent damage to the testicle Loss of testicle Infertility Infection Cosmetic deformity Epididymitis complications Epididymo-orchitis Abscess (a collection of pus) formation Impaired fertility Systemic blood infection (sepsis) There are no significant complications for torsion of a testicular appendage. Permanent damage to the testicle Atrophy (decrease in size) of the testicle Loss of testicle Infertility Abscess formation Cosmetic deformity Testicular torsion Incarceration (hernia unable to be pushed back in) Strangulation (disruption to the blood supply of the intestine protruding through the abdominal wall defect) Atrophy of the testicle Impaired fertility Abscess formation Permanent kidney damage Urosepsis (systemic blood infection arising from infected urine) The complications of a testicular tumor vary depending on the underlying type of tumor and the extent of disease."
How can testicular pain be prevented?,"'There are a few measures that you can take to prevent certain causes of testicular pain. However, many of the causes are not entirely preventable.' For epididymitis or bacterial orchitis caused by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), condom use can reduce the risk of transmission of STDs. The use of appropriate protective gear during sporting activities can help prevent testicular trauma. Mumps immunization can decrease the incidence of viral orchitis."
Facts you should know about thoracic outlet syndrome," Thoracic outlet syndrome is a condition whereby symptoms are produced from compression of nerves or blood vessels, or both, because of an inadequate passageway through an area (thoracic outlet) between the base of the neck and the armpit. Thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms includeneck pain,shoulder pain,arm pain,numbness and tingling of the fingers, andimpaired circulation to the extremities (causing discoloration). neck pain, shoulder pain, arm pain, numbness and tingling of the fingers, and impaired circulation to the extremities (causing discoloration). Diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome is suggested by the symptoms and physical findings and is sometimes supported by nerve conduction and/or radiology tests. Treatment of thoracic outlet syndrome usually involves physical-therapy exercises and avoiding certain prolonged positions of the shoulder."
What is thoracic outlet syndrome?,"'Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a condition whereby symptoms are produced (such as numbness in fingers, ''pain'' in shoulder, arm, and neck) due to compression of nerves and/or blood vessels in the upper chest. The passageway for these nerves and blood vessels to exit the chest and supply the upper extremities is referred to as the thoracic outlet. Muscle, bone, and other tissues border the thoracic outlet. Any condition that results in enlargement or movement of these tissues of or near the thoracic outlet can cause the thoracic outlet syndrome. These conditions include muscle enlargement (such as from ''weight lifting''), injuries, an extra rib extending from the neck (cervical rib), ''weight gain'', and rare tumors at the top of the lung. Often no specific cause is detectable.''It is felt by some scientists that the evolution of the torso of primates from a four-legged to a two-legged position may predispose humans to the development of thoracic outlet syndrome. The resulting vertical posture produced flattening of the chest cage and a shift of the shoulder joint backward, both of which narrowed the thoracic outlet.' "
What causes thoracic outlet syndrome?,"'An inadequate passageway for nerves and blood vessels as they pass through an area (thoracic outlet) between the base of the neck and the armpit causes thoracic outlet syndrome. This can be constant or intermittent. Thoracic outlet syndrome can be caused by weight lifting, ''obesity'', tumors in the chest, and extra ribs extending from the seventh cervical vertebra at the base of the neck.'  "
What are thoracic outlet syndrome risk factors?,"'Risk factors include occupations that involve heavy usage of the upper extremities against resistance, including jack-hammer operators and dental hygienists, weight lifting, ''pregnancy'', and obesity. Any condition that causes encroachment of the space for the brachial plexus at the thoracic outlet can lead to thoracic outlet syndrome, including poor posture.' "
What are thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms include neck, shoulder, and arm ''pain'', numbness in the fingers, or impaired circulation and flushed sensations to the extremities (causing discoloration). The involved upper extremity can feel weak. Often symptoms are reproduced or worsened when the arm is positioned above the shoulder or extended. Patients can have a wide spectrum of symptoms from mild and intermittent to severe and constant. Pains can extend to the fingers and hands, causing ''weakness''.'  "
What tests do physicians use to diagnose thoracic outlet syndrome?,"'The diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome is suggested by the symptoms and supported by findings of the doctor during the examination. Certain maneuvers of the arm and neck can produce symptoms and blood vessel ""pinching,"" causing a loss of pulse. This includes the Adson\'s maneuver, whereby the examiner moves the shoulder joint into positions that can cause pinching of both the nerves and artery to the tested arm. Further supportive testing can include electrical tests, such as ''electromyogram'' (''EMG'') and somatosensory evoked responses (although these may not be positive in all patients). Some patients can have ''angiogram'' X-ray tests that demonstrate the pinched area of the blood vessel involved.'  "
What is the treatment for thoracic outlet syndrome? What are medications for thoracic outlet syndrome? Is surgery necessary for TOS?,"'Treatment of the thoracic outlet syndrome can usually be successful with conservative measures. Treatments include a variety of exercises that effectively stretch open the tissues of the thoracic outlet. These are done with and without weights in the hands to pull the outlet into a ""relaxed"" open position. Physical therapists are specially trained in the instruction of exercises for thoracic outlet syndrome, and their evaluation of the patient can be helpful. Shoulder-shrug exercises and others can be done at home or at work to relax the muscles around the thoracic outlet.''A health care professional might prescribe medications to help improve the symptoms, such as anti-inflammatory medications (''ibuprofen'' [''Advil''], ''naproxen'' [''Aleve'']) and muscle relaxants.''Some patients with severe, resistant symptoms can require surgery to open the thoracic outlet. These procedures include interruption of the scalene muscle (scalenotomy) and removal (resection) of the first rib in order to spare injury to the affected nerve and blood vessels from ongoing compression. Thoracic outlet syndrome that affects the vascular system (veins and arteries) is more likely to require surgery to resolve the symptoms.'  "
What are home remedies for thoracic outlet syndrome?,"'Patients should avoid prolonged positions with their arms held out or overhead. For example, it is best to avoid sleeping with the arm extended up behind the head. It is also helpful to have rest periods at work to minimize ''fatigue''. Weight reduction can be helpful for ''obese'' patients. Patients should avoid sleeping on their stomach with their arms above the head. They should also not repetitively lift heavy objects.' "
What types of doctors treat thoracic outlet syndrome?,"'Doctors who treat thoracic outlet syndrome include general physicians, such as general-medicine doctors, family medicine doctors, and internists, as well as ''rheumatologists'', physical-medicine doctors, and chest surgeons.' "
What is the prognosis for thoracic outlet syndrome?,"'Most people with thoracic outlet syndrome can have complete resolution of symptoms with conservative measures, including exercises specific for thoracic outlet syndrome, physical therapy, and avoiding stressing the tissues of the thoracic outlet. It can be helpful to avoid sleeping with the arms extended above the head. Rarely, surgical intervention can be necessary to take pressure off of involved nerves and blood vessels. Complications include embolization to the hand and nerve damage to the extremity involved.' "
Is it possible to prevent thoracic outlet syndrome?,"""It's possible to prevent thoracic outlet syndrome by maintaining relaxed tissues of the upper chest. This can involve ""'prevention'' exercises, stretches, and therapies designed to loosen the tissues around the shoulders and neck.' "
What is a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure whereby the uterus (womb) is removed. This surgery for women is the most common non-obstetrical surgical procedure in the United States.''Approximately 300 out of every 100,000 women will undergo a hysterectomy.'  "
What are the three types of prolapse?,"'A hysterectomy is performed for the treatment of ''uterine cancer'' or very severe pre-''cancers'' (called dysplasia, ''carcinoma in situ'', or CIN III or microinvasive ''carcinoma'' of the cervix). A hysterectomy for ''endometrial cancer'' (uterine lining ''cancer'') is the removal of the ''cancer'' from the body. Hysterectomy is the foundation of treatment for uterine ''cancer''.''The most common reason hysterectomy is performed is for ''uterine fibroids''.''Other common reasons are:''Only 10% of hysterectomies are performed for cancer. This article will primarily focus on the use of hysterectomy for non-cancerous, non-emergency reasons, which can involve even more challenging decisions for women and their doctors.''The most common reason for a hysterecotmy are ''uterine fibroids'' (also known as uterine leiomyomata). ''Uterine fibroids'"" are benign (non-cancerous) growths of the uterus, the cause of which is unknown. Although the majority of them don't cause or turn into uterine cancer""'Uterine fibroids can cause medical problems. Reasons for a hysterectomy in women with uterine fibroids are:''Pelvic relaxation'' is another condition that can require treatment with a hysterectomy. In this condition, a woman experiences a loosening of the support muscles and tissues in the pelvic floor area. Mild relaxation can cause first degree prolapse''There are three types of prolapse:''Second and third degree uterine prolapse must be treated with hysterectomy.''A ''cystocele'', rectocele, or urethrocele can lead to symptoms of, for example:''Urine loss tends to be aggravated by:''Risk factors for pelvic relaxation'':The most common risk factor for pelvic relaxation is childbearing; although, there may be other causes. Avoiding birth and having a caesarean section (''C-section'"") doesn't necessarily eliminate the risk of developing pelvic relaxation."" Abnormal uterine bleeding (vaginal bleeding), Cervical dysplasia (pre-cancerous conditions of the cervix), Endometriosis Urerine prolapse (including pelvic relaxation). Excessive size (usually greater than the size of a two-month pregnancy). Pressure or pain. Bleeding severe enough to cause anemia. First degree prolapse: Mild relaxation can cause, in which the cervix (the uterine opening) is about halfway down into the vagina. Second degree prolapse: In second degree prolapse the cervix or leading edge of the uterus has moved to the vaginal opening. Third degree prolapse: In third degree prolapse, the cervix and uterus protrude past the vaginal opening. Urinary incontinence (unintentional loss of urine) Pelvic heaviness Impaired sexual performance. Sneezing Coughing Jumping Laughing"
What tests or treatments are performed prior to a hysterectomy?,"'A woman must have a pelvic examination, ''Pap smear'', and a diagnosis prior to proceeding with a hysterectomy.''Therefore, a premenopausal (still having regular menstrual periods) woman whose uterine fibroids are causing bleeding but no pain is generally first offered medical therapy with hormones. Non-hormonal treatments are also available, such as ''tranexamic acid'' and more moderate surgical procedures, such as ablations (removal of the lining of the uterus). If she still has significant bleeding that causes major impairment to her daily life, or the bleeding continues to cause ''anemia'' (''low red blood cell count'' due to blood loss), and she has no abnormality on endometrial sampling, she may be considered for a hysterectomy.''A ''postmenopausal'' woman (whose menstrual periods have ceased permanently) who has no abnormalities in the samples of her uterus (endometrial sampling) and still has persistent abnormal bleeding after trying ''hormone therapy'', may be considered for a hysterectomy. Several dose adjustments or different types of hormones may be required to decide on the optimal medical treatment for an individual woman.' Prior to having a hysterectomy for pelvic pain, women might undergo more limited (less extensive) exploratory surgery procedures (such as laparoscopy) to rule out other causes of pain. Prior to having a hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding, women require some type of sampling of the lining of the uterus (biopsy of the endometrium) to rule out cancer or pre-cancer of the uterus. This procedure is called endometrial sampling. Also, pelvic ultrasounds and/or pelvic computerized tomography (CT) tests can be done to confirm a diagnosis. In a woman with pelvic pain or bleeding, a trial of medication treatment is often given before a hysterectomy is considered."
How is a hysterectomy performed?,"   In the past the most common hysterectomy was done by an incision (cut) through the abdomen (abdominal hysterectomy). Now most surgeries can utilize laparoscopic assisted or vaginal hysterectomies (performed through the vagina rather than through the abdomen) for quicker and easier recovery. The hospital stay generally tends to be longer with an abdominal hysterectomy than with a vaginal hysterectomy, and hospital charges tend to be higher. The procedures seem to take comparable lengths of time (about two hours), unless the uterus is of a very large size, in which case a vaginal hysterectomy may take longer."
What are the types of hysterectomies?,"'There are now a variety of surgical techniques for performing hysterectomies. The ideal surgical procedure for each woman depends on her particular medical condition. Below, the different types of hysterectomy are discussed with general guidelines about which technique is considered for which type of medical situation. However, the final decision must be made after an individualized discussion between the woman and physician who best understands her individual situation.''Remember, as a general rule, before any type of hysterectomy, women should have the following tests in order to select the optimal procedure:' Complete pelvic exam including manually examining the ovaries and uterus. Up-to-date Pap smear. Pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate, depending on what the physician finds on examination. A decision regarding whether or not to remove the ovaries at the time of hysterectomy. A complete blood count and an attempt to correct anemia if possible. Total abdominal hysterectomy Vaginal hysterectomy Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy Supracervical hysterectomy Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy Radical hysterectomy Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy"
"Total abdominal hysterectomy, the most common type","'The total abdominal hysterectomy\xa0is the most common type of hysterectomy. During a total abdominal hysterectomy, the doctor removes the uterus, including the cervix. The ''scar'' on the abdomen may be horizontal or vertical, depending on the reason the procedure is performed, and the size of the area being treated.' Cancer of the ovary(s) and uterus, endometriosis, and large uterine fibroids are treated with total abdominal hysterectomy. Total abdominal hysterectomy may also be done in some unusual cases of very severe pelvic pain, after a very thorough evaluation to identify the cause of the pain, and only after attempts at non-surgical treatments. Clearly a woman cannot bear children after this procedure, so it is not generally performed on women who desire childbearing unless there is a serious condition, such as cancer. Total abdominal hysterectomy allows the whole abdomen and pelvis to be examined, which is an advantage in women with cancer or investigating growths of unclear cause."
Vaginal hysterectomy procedure,"'During this procedure, the uterus is removed through the vagina. A vaginal hysterectomy is appropriate for conditions such as uterine prolapse, endometrial hyperplasia, or cervical dysplasia.' These are conditions in which the uterus is not too large, and in which the whole abdomen does not require examination using a more extensive surgical procedure. The woman will need to have her legs raised up in a stirrup device throughout the procedure. Women who have not had children may not have a large enough vaginal canal for this type of procedure. If a woman has too large a uterus, cannot have her legs raised in the stirrup device for prolonged periods, or has other reasons why the whole upper abdomen must be further examined, the doctor will usually recommend an abdominal hysterectomy."
Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy,"'Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (''LAVH'') is similar to the vaginal hysterectomy procedure described above, but it adds the use of a laparoscope. A laparoscope is a very thin viewing tube used to visualize structures within the abdomen. Certain women would be best served by having laparoscopy used during vaginal hysterectomy because it allows the upper abdomen to be carefully inspected during surgery. Examples of uses of the laparoscope would be for early endometrial cancer (to verify lack of spread of cancer), or if oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) is planned. Just as with simple vaginal hysterectomy without a laparoscope, the uterus must not be excessively large. The physician will also review the medical situation to be sure there are no special risks prohibiting use of the procedure, such as prior surgery that could have increased the risk for abnormal scarring (adhesions). If a woman has such a history of prior surgery, or if she has a large pelvic mass, a regular abdominal hysterectomy might be considered.' "
Supracervical hysterectomy,"'A supracervical hysterectomy is used to remove the uterus while sparing the cervix, leaving it as a ""stump."" The cervix is the area that forms the very bottom of the uterus, and sits at the very end (top) of the vaginal canal (see illustration above). The procedure probably does not totally rule out the possibility of developing cancer in this remnant ""stump."" Women who have had abnormal Pap smears or ''cervical cancer'' clearly are not appropriate candidates for this procedure. Other women may be able to have the procedure if there is no reason to have the cervix removed. In some cases the cervix is actually better left in place, such as some cases of severe ''endometriosis''. It is a simpler procedure and requires less time to perform. It may give some added support of the vagina, decreasing the risk for the development of protrusion of the vaginal contents through the vaginal opening (vaginal prolapse).' "
Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy,"'The laparoscopic supra cervical hysterectomy procedure is performed like the LAVH procedure, but the uterus is separated from the cervix, and the uterine tissue is removed through the laparoscopic incision. Recovery is generally faster than with other types of hysterectomy. Cervical preservation is less likely to result in menses (''menstruation'') as the inner lining of the cervix is usually cauterized.' "
Radical hysterectomy,'The radical hysterectomy procedure involves more extensive surgery than a total abdominal hysterectomy because it also includes removing tissues surrounding the uterus and removal of the upper vagina. Radical hysterectomy is most commonly performed for early ''cervical cancer''. There are more complications with radical hysterectomy compared to abdominal hysterectomy. These include injury to the bowels and urinary system.' 
Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes),"'Oophorectomy is the surgical removal of the ovary(s), while oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes)is the removal of the ovary and its adjacent Fallopian tube. These two procedures are performed for ''ovarian cancer'', removal of suspicious ovarian tumors, or Fallopian tube cancer (which is very rare). They may also be performed due to complications of infection, or in combination with hysterectomy for cancer. Occasionally, women with ''inherited'' types of cancer of the ovary or breast will have an oophorectomy as preventive (prophylactic) surgery in order to reduce the risk of future cancer of the ovary or breast. Current recommendations are that the fallopian tubes should be removed during hysterectomy even if the ovaries are preserved. This is done to decrease the lifetime risk of ''ovarian cancer'', which can arise from the fallopian tubes in up to 25% of case.' "
What are complications of a hysterectomy?,"'Complications of a hysterectomy include''An abdominal hysterectomy has a higher rate of post-operative infection and pain than does a vaginal hysterectomy.'   infection, pain, and bleeding in the surgical area."
What are the alternatives to a hysterectomy?,"'A hysterectomy for conditions other than cancer generally are not considered until after other less invasive treatments are unsuccessful.' Newer procedures, for example, uterine artery embolization (UAE) or surgical removal of a portion of the uterus (myomectomy), are being used to treat excessive uterine bleeding. Endometrial ablation and newer medications are alternatives."
Should women who have had a hysterectomy continue to have Pap smears?,"'Any woman with a history of abnormal Pap smears should have Pap smears for the remainder of her life. This is because of the low, but real, chance that cervical cancer can recur at the surgical site where the cervix was removed.''In addition, women with a history of abnormal Pap smears, other women who require continued. Pap smears are women with supracervical hysterectomy, where the cervix was left in place. In this situation, in contrast to the woman who has had hysterectomy for reasons of cervical cancer, the woman who has had supracervical hysterectomy will be able to follow the same screening guidelines as for other women who have not had surgery. For example, the physician may stop doing Pap smears at age 65 if the woman has been well-screened and has always had normal Pap smears.''Women who do not need to continue having Pap smears are those who have had vaginal hysterectomy or abdominal hysterectomy for benign (not cancer) reasons, such as uterine fibroids. If they have had normal Pap smears prior to the procedure, they need not continue to have Pap smears after their surgery.' "
Facts you should know about total hip replacement," The prostheses for a total hip replacement (total hip arthroplasty) can be inserted into the pelvis and femur with or without cement. The options are customized for each patient by the orthopedic surgeon. Chronic pain and impairment of daily function of patients with severe hip arthritis are reasons for considering treatment with total hip replacement. Complications and risks of total hip replacement surgery have been identified. Preoperative banking of the blood of patients planning total hip replacement is considered when possible. This blood can be used for transfusion if needed (autologous transfusion). Physical therapy is an essential part of rehabilitation after a total hip replacement. Patients with artificial joints are generally recommended to take antibiotics before, during, and after any elective invasive procedures (including dental work)."
What is a total hip replacement?,"'A total hip replacement is a surgical procedure whereby the diseased cartilage and bone of the hip joint is surgically replaced with artificial materials. The normal hip joint is a ball and socket joint. The socket is a ""cup-shaped"" component of the pelvis called the acetabulum. The ball is the head of the thighbone (femur). Total hip joint replacement involves surgical removal of the diseased ball and socket and replacing them with a metal (or ceramic) ball and stem inserted into the femur bone and an artificial ''plastic'' (or ceramic) cup socket. The metallic artificial ball and stem are referred to as the ""femoral prosthesis"" and the plastic cup socket is the ""acetabular prosthesis."" Upon inserting the prosthesis into the central core of the femur, it is fixed with a bony cement called methylmethacrylate. Alternatively, a ""cementless"" prosthesis is used that has microscopic pores which allow bony ingrowth from the normal femur into the prosthesis stem. This ""cementless"" hip is felt to have a longer duration and is considered especially for younger patients. Total hip replacement is also referred to as total hip arthroplasty.'  "
Who is a candidate for total hip replacement?,"'Total hip replacements are performed most commonly because of progressively worsening of severe ''arthritis'' in the hip joint. The most common type of arthritis leading to total hip replacement is ''degenerative arthritis'' (''osteoarthritis'') of the hip joint. This type of arthritis is generally seen with ''aging'', congenital abnormality of the hip joint, or prior ''trauma'' to the hip joint. Other conditions leading to total hip replacement include bony ''fractures'' of the hip joint, ''rheumatoid arthritis'', and death (''aseptic necrosis'', or ''avascular necrosis'') of the hip bone. Hip bone necrosis can be caused by ''fracture'' of the hip, ''drugs'' (such as chronic use of ''prednisone'' and ''prednisolone''), ''alcoholism'', and systemic diseases (such as ''systemic lupus erythematosus'').''The progressively intense ''chronic pain'', together with impairment of daily function including ''walking'', climbing stairs, and even arising from a sitting position, eventually become reasons to consider a total hip replacement. Because replaced hip joints can fail with time, whether and when to perform total hip replacement are not easy decisions, especially in younger patients. Replacement is generally considered after ''pain'' becomes so severe that it impedes normal function despite use of anti-inflammatory and/or ''pain'' medications. A total hip joint replacement is usually an elective procedure, which means that it is an option selected among other alternatives and can be scheduled on a routine basis. It is a decision that is made with an understanding of the potential risks and benefits. A thorough understanding of both the procedure and anticipated outcome is an important part of the decision-making process with the orthopedic surgeon.'  "
What are total hip replacement complications?,"'The risks of total hip replacement include ''blood clots'' in the lower extremities that can travel to the ''lungs'' (''pulmonary embolism''). Severe cases of ''pulmonary embolism'' are rare but can cause respiratory failure and death. Other problems include difficulty with urination, local skin or joint infection, ''fracture'' of the bone during and after surgery, scarring, limitation of motion of the hip, dislocation of the hip replacement, and loosening of the prosthesis that eventually leads to prosthesis failure. Because total hip joint replacement requires anesthesia, the usual risks of anesthesia apply and include ''heart'' arrhythmias, ''stroke'', ''liver'' toxicity, and ''pneumonia''.' "
What preparation is needed for the procedure?,"'The preoperative evaluation generally includes a review of all medications being taken by the patient. Anti-inflammatory medications, including ''aspirin'', are often discontinued one week prior to surgery because of the effect of these medications on platelet function and blood clotting. Other preoperative evaluations include complete blood counts, ''electrolytes'' (potassium, sodium, chloride), blood tests for kidney and liver functions, ''urinalysis'', ''chest X-ray'', ''EKG'', and a physical examination. Your physician will determine which of these tests are required, based on your age and medical conditions. Any indications of infection, severe heart or lung disease, or active metabolic disturbances such as uncontrolled ''diabetes'' may postpone or defer total hip joint surgery.''If the condition of the hip allows it, some doctors will recommend a preoperative ''exercise'' program to build muscle and increase flexibility. This can help with recovery.''Total hip joint replacement can involve blood loss. Patients planning to undergo total hip replacement often will donate their own (autologous) blood to be stored for transfusion during the surgery. Should ''blood transfusion'' be required, the patient will have the advantage of having his or her own blood available, thus minimizing the risks related to blood transfusions.' "
What will recovery be like for the patient after surgery?,"'A total hip joint replacement takes approximately two to four hours of surgical time. The preparation prior to surgery may take up additional time. After surgery, the patient is taken to a recovery room for immediate observation that generally lasts between one to four hours. The lower extremities will be closely observed for both adequate sensation and circulation. If unusual symptoms of numbness or tingling are noted by the patient, recovery room nurses are available and should be notified by the patient. Upon stabilization, the patient is transferred to a hospital room.'""During the immediate recovery period, patients are given intravenous fluids. Intravenous fluids are important to maintain a patient's electrolytes and replace any fluids lost during surgery. Using the same IV, antibiotics might be administered as well as pain medication. Patients also will notice tubes draining fluid from the surgical ""'wound'' site. The amount and character of the drainage is important to the doctor and can be monitored closely by the nurse in attendance. A dressing is applied in the operating room and will remain in place for two to four days to be later changed by the attending surgeon and staff.''Pain-control medications are commonly given through a patient-controlled-analgesia (PCA) pump whereby patients can actually administer their own dose of medications on demand. Pain medications occasionally can cause ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Antinausea medications may then be given.''Measures are taken to prevent blood clots in the lower extremities. Patients are placed in elastic hose (TEDs) after surgery. Compression stockings are often added, which help by forcing blood circulation in the legs. Patients are encouraged to actively ''exercise'' the lower extremities in order to mobilize venous blood in the lower extremities to prevent blood clots. Medications are often given to thin the blood in order to further prevent blood clots.''Patients may also experience difficulty with urination. This difficulty can be a side effect of medications given for pain. As a result, catheters are often placed into the bladder to allow normal passage of urine.''Immediately after surgery, patients are encouraged to frequently perform deep ''breathing'' and ''coughing'' in order to avoid lung ''congestion'' and the collapse of tiny airways in the lungs. Patients are also given a ""blow bottle,"" whereby active blowing against resistance maintains the opening of the breathing passages.' "
What is involved in the rehabilitation process after total hip joint replacement?,"'After total hip joint replacement surgery, patients often start physical therapy immediately! On the first day after surgery, it is common to begin some minor physical therapy while sitting in a chair. Eventually, rehabilitation incorporates stepping, walking, and climbing. Initially, supportive devices such as a walker or crutches are used. Pain is monitored while exercise takes place. Some degree of discomfort is normal. It is often very gratifying for the patient to notice, even early on, substantial relief from the preoperative pain for which the total hip replacement was performed.''Physical therapy is extremely important in the overall outcome of any joint replacement surgery. The goals of physical therapy are to prevent contractures, improve patient education, and strengthen muscles around the hip joint through controlled exercises. Contractures that can cause limitation of joint motion result from scarring of the tissues around the joint. Contractures do not permit full range of motion and therefore impede mobility of the replaced joint. Patients are instructed not to strain the hip joint with heavy lifting or other unusual activities at home. Specific techniques of body posturing, sitting, and using an elevated toilet seat can be extremely helpful. Patients are instructed not to cross the operated lower extremity across the midline of the body (not crossing the leg over the other leg) because of the risk of dislocating the replaced joint. They are discouraged from bending at the waist and are instructed to use a pillow between the legs when lying on the non-operated side in order to prevent the operated lower extremity from crossing over the midline. Patients are given home exercise programs to strengthen the muscles around the buttock and thigh. Most patients attend outpatient physical therapy for a period of time while incorporating home exercises regularly into their daily living.''Occupational therapists are also part of the rehabilitation process. These therapists review precautions with the patients related to everyday activities. They also educate the patients about the adaptive equipment that is available and the proper ways to do their ""ADLs"" or activities of daily living.'  "
What other postoperative instructions are given to patients with total hip joint replacements?,"'Patients will continue to use supportive devices as monitored and recommended by the therapist and attending physician. Medications are likely to be given to further prevent blood clots in the legs. These include ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'') or aspirin medications. Occasionally, ''heparin'' (''enoxaparin'' [''Lovenox'']) can be given by self-injection at home. A doctor will determine how long a patient needs to take this medication. Additional medications are given for pain, ''sleep'', and occasionally for muscle relaxation.'""Gradually, patients become more confident and less dependent on supportive devices. Patients are instructed to look for signs of infection, including swelling, warmth, redness, or increased pain in or around the surgical site. The patient should notify the doctor's office immediately if these changes are noted or if there is injury to the hip. The wound site will be inspected regularly by the attending physician. The ""'sutures'', which are usually staples, are removed several weeks after the operation.' "
What is the prognosis of total hip joint replacement?,"'Patient education is important to ensure longevity of the replaced hip. Strenuous exercises such as ''running'' or contact sports are discouraged, since these activities can reinjure the replaced hip. ''Swimming'' is ideal in improving muscle strength and promoting mobility and endurance.''Patients should be aware and notify any caregivers that they have an artificial joint. Antibiotics are recommended during any invasive procedures, whether surgical, urological, gastroenterological, or dental. Infections elsewhere in the body should also be treated to prevent seeding of infection into the joint. This is important because bacteria can pass through the bloodstream from these sites and cause infection of the hip prosthesis.''Measurements of metallic substances that can erode away from the metal portions of hip replacements can indicate toxicity or wear of the prostheses. With high levels of cobalt measured in blood of these patients, it is suggested that an ''MRI'' of the hip be performed to be certain an abnormal growth of tissue (pseudotumor) is not present.''Hip joint replacement surgery is one of the most successful joint surgeries performed today. In well-selected patients, who are appropriate candidates for total hip replacements, the procedure lasts at least 15 years in most patients. Long-term results have been improving impressively with new devices and techniques. The future will provide newer techniques which will further improve patient outcomes, mobility, and lessen the potential for complications.'  "
What is a total knee replacement?,"'A total knee replacement is a surgical procedure whereby the diseased knee joint is replaced with artificial material. The knee is a hinge joint that provides motion at the point where the thigh meets the lower leg. The thighbone (or femur) abuts the large bone of the lower leg (tibia) at the knee joint.''During a total knee replacement, the end of the femur bone is removed and replaced with a metal shell. The end of the lower leg bone (tibia) is also removed and replaced with a channeled ''plastic'' piece with a metal stem. Depending on the condition of the kneecap portion of the knee joint, a plastic ""button"" may also be added under the kneecap surface. The artificial components of a total knee replacement are referred to as the prosthesis.''The posterior cruciate ligament is a tissue that normally stabilizes each side of the knee joint so that the lower leg cannot slide backward in relation to the thighbone. In total knee replacement surgery, this ligament is either retained, sacrificed, or substituted by a polyethylene post. Each of these various designs of total knee replacement has its own particular benefits and risks.'  "
What patients should consider a total knee replacement?,"'Total knee replacement surgery is considered for patients whose knee joints have been damaged by either progressive ''arthritis'', ''trauma'', or other rare destructive diseases of the joint. The most common reason for knee replacement in the United States is severe ''osteoarthritis'' of the knees.''Regardless of the cause of the damage to the joint, the resulting progressively increasing ''pain'' and ''stiffness'' and decreasing daily function lead the patient to consider total knee replacement. Decisions regarding whether or when to undergo knee replacement surgery are not easy. Patients should understand the risks as well as the benefits before making these decisions about knee replacement.'  "
What are the risks of undergoing a total knee replacement?,"'Risks of total knee replacement include ''blood clots'' in the legs that can travel to the ''lungs'' (pulmonaryembolism). ''Pulmonary embolism'' can cause ''shortness of breath'', ''chest pain'', and even ''shock''. Other risks include ''urinary tract infection'', ''nausea'' and ''vomiting'' (usually related to pain medication), chronic ''knee pain'' and stiffness, bleeding into the knee joint, nerve damage, blood vessel injury, and infection of the knee which can require reoperation. Furthermore, the risks of anesthesia include potential ''heart'', lung, kidney, and ''liver'' damage.' "
What is involved with the pre-operative evaluation for total knee replacement?,"'Before surgery, the joints adjacent to the diseased knee (hip and ankle) are carefully evaluated. This is important to ensure optimal outcome and recovery from the surgery. Replacing a knee joint that is adjacent to a severely damaged joint may not yield significant improvement in function as the nearby joint may become more painful if it is abnormal. Furthermore, all medications that the patient is taking are reviewed. Blood-thinning medications such as ''warfarin'' (''Coumadin'') and anti-inflammatory medications such as ''aspirin'' may have to be adjusted or discontinued prior to knee replacement surgery.''Routine blood tests of liver and kidney function and urine tests are evaluated for signs of ''anemia'', infection, or abnormal metabolism. ''Chest X-ray'' and ''EKG'"" are performed to exclude significant heart and lung disease that may preclude surgery or anesthesia. Finally, a knee replacement surgery is less likely to have good long-term outcome if the patient's weight is greater than 200 pounds. Excess body weight simply puts the replaced knee at an increased risk of loosening and/or dislocation and makes recovery more difficult.""'Another risk is encountered in younger patients who may tend to be more active, thereby adding trauma to the replaced joint.' "
What happens in the post-operative period? What is involved in the recovery from surgery?,"'A total knee replacement generally requires between one and a half to three hours of operative time. Post-surgery, patients are taken to a recovery room, where vital organs are frequently monitored. When stabilized, patients are returned to their hospital room.''Passage of urine can be difficult in the immediate postoperative period, and this condition can be aggravated by pain medications. A catheter inserted into the urethra (a Foley catheter) allows free passage of urine until the patient becomes more mobile.''Physical therapy is an extremely important part of rehabilitation and requires full participation by the patient for optimal outcome. Patients can begin physical therapy 48 hours after surgery. Some degree of pain, discomfort, and stiffness can be expected during the early days of physical therapy. Knee immobilizers are used in order to stabilize the knee while undergoing physical therapy, ''walking'', and sleeping. They may be removed under the guidance of the physical therapist for various portions of physical therapy.''A unique device that can help speed recovery is the continuous passive motion (CPM) machine. The CPM machine is first attached to the operated leg. The machine then constantly moves the knee through various degrees of range of motion for hours while the patient relaxes. This can help to improve circulation and minimize the risk of scarring and contracture of the tissues around the knee.''Patients will start walking using a walker and crutches. Eventually, patients will learn to walk up and down stairs and grades. A number of home exercises are given to strengthen thigh and calf muscles.'  "
How does the patient continue to improve as an outpatient after discharge from the hospital? What are recommended exercises?,"'For an optimal outcome after total knee replacement surgery, it is important for patients to continue in an outpatient physical-therapy program along with home exercises during the healing process. Patients will be asked to continue exercising the muscles around the replaced joint to prevent scarring (and contracture) and maintain muscle strength for the purposes of joint stability. These exercises after surgery can reduce recovery time and lead to optimal strength and stability.''The ''wound'' will be monitored by the surgeon and his/her staff for healing. Patients also should watch for warning signs of infection, including abnormal redness, increasing warmth, swelling, or unusual pain. It is important to report any injury to the joint to the doctor immediately.''Future activities are generally limited to those that do not risk injuring the replaced joint. Sports that involve ''running'' or contact are avoided, in favor of leisure sports, such as golf, and ''swimming''. Swimming is the ideal form of ''exercise'', since the sport improves muscle strength and endurance without exerting any pressure or ''stress'' on the replaced joint.''Patients with joint replacements should alert their doctors and dentists that they have an artificial joint. These joints are at risk for infection by bacteria introduced by any invasive procedures such as surgery, dental or gum procedures, urological and endoscopic procedures, as well as from infections elsewhere in the body.''The treating physician will typically prescribe antibiotics before, during, and immediately after any elective procedures in order to prevent infection of the replaced joint.''Though infrequent, patients with total knee replacements can require a second operation years later. The second operation can be necessary because of loosening, ''fracture'', or other complications of the replaced joint. Reoperations are generally not as successful as original operations and carry higher risks of complications. Future replacement devices and techniques will improve patient outcomes and lead to fewer complications.'  "
What is Tourette syndrome?,"'Tourette syndrome'' (TS) is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, stereotyped, involuntary movements and vocalizations called tics. The disorder is named for Dr. Georges Gilles de la Tourette, the pioneering French ''neurologist'' who in 1885 first described the condition in an 86-year-old French noblewoman.''The early symptoms of Tourette syndrome are almost always noticed first in childhood, with the average onset between the ages of 7 and 10 years. Tourette syndrome occurs in people from all ethnic groups; males are affected about three to four times more often than females. It is estimated that 200,000 Americans have the most severe form of Tourette syndrome, and as many as one in 100 exhibit milder and less complex symptoms such as chronic motor or vocal tics or transient tics of childhood. Although Tourette syndrome can be a chronic condition with symptoms lasting a lifetime, most people with the condition experience their worst symptoms in their early ''teens'', with improvement occurring in the late teens and continuing into adulthood.' "
What are the symptoms of Tourette syndrome?,"'Tics are classified as either simple or complex.''Simple tics:'' Simple motor tics are sudden, brief, repetitive movements that involve a limited number of muscle groups. Some of the more common simple tics include eye blinking and other vision irregularities, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and head or shoulder jerking.  Simple vocalizations might include repetitive throat-clearing, sniffing, or grunting sounds. ''Complex tics:'' Complex tics are distinct, coordinated patterns of movements involving several muscle groups. Complex motor tics might include facial grimacing combined with a head twist and a shoulder shrug. Other complex motor tics may actually appear purposeful, including sniffing or touching objects, hopping, jumping, bending, or twisting. Simple vocal tics may include throat-clearing, sniffing/snorting, grunting, or barking. More complex vocal tics include words or phrases.  Perhaps the most dramatic and disabling tics include motor movements that result in self-harm such as punching oneself in the face or vocal tics including coprolalia (uttering swear words) or ''echolalia'' (repeating the words or phrases of others). Some tics are preceded by an urge or sensation in the affected muscle group, commonly called a premonitory urge. ''Some with Tourette syndrome will describe a need to complete a tic in a certain way or a certain number of times in order to relieve the urge or decrease the sensation. ''Tics are often worse with excitement or ''anxiety'' and better during calm, focused activities. Certain physical experiences can trigger or worsen tics, for example tight collars may trigger neck tics, or ''hearing'' another person sniff or throat-clear may trigger similar sounds. Tics do not go away during ''sleep'' but are often significantly diminished.' "
What is the course of Tourette syndrome?,"'Tics come and go over time, varying in type, frequency, location, and severity.  The first symptoms usually occur in the head and neck area and may progress to include muscles of the trunk and extremities. Motor tics generally precede the development of vocal tics and simple tics often precede complex tics.  Most patients experience peak tic severity before the mid-teen years with improvement for the majority of patients in the late teen years and early adulthood. Approximately 10 percent of those affected have a progressive or disabling course that lasts into adulthood.' "
Can people with Tourette syndrome control their tics?,"'Although the symptoms of Tourette syndrome are involuntary, some people can sometimes suppress, camouflage, or otherwise manage their tics in an effort to minimize their impact on functioning. However, people with Tourette syndrome often report a substantial buildup in tension when suppressing their tics to the point where they feel that the tic must be expressed. Tics in response to an environmental trigger can appear to be voluntary or purposeful but are not. ' "
What causes Tourette syndrome?,"'Although the cause of Tourette syndrome is unknown, current research points to abnormalities in certain brain regions (including the basal ganglia, frontal lobes, and cortex), the circuits that interconnect these regions, and the neurotransmitters (''dopamine'', serotonin, and norepinephrine) responsible for communication among nerve cells. Given the often complex presentation of Tourette syndrome, the cause of the disorder is likely to be equally complex.' "
What disorders are associated with Tourette syndrome?,"'Many with Tourette syndrome experience additional neurobehavioral problems including ''inattention''; ''hyperactivity'' and ''impulsivity'' (''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder''-''ADHD'') and related problems with reading, writing, and arithmetic; and obsessive-compulsive symptoms such as intrusive thoughts/worries and repetitive behaviors. For example, worries about dirt and germs may be associated with repetitive hand-washing, and concerns about bad things happening may be associated with ritualistic behaviors such as counting, repeating, or ordering and arranging.  People with Tourette syndrome have also reported problems with ''depression'' or ''anxiety'' disorders, as well as other difficulties with living, that may or may not be directly related to Tourette syndrome.  Given the range of potential complications, people with Tourette syndrome are best served by receiving medical care that provides a comprehensive treatment plan.' "
How is Tourette syndrome diagnosed?,"'Tourette syndrome is a diagnosis that doctors make after verifying that the patient has had both motor and vocal tics for at least 1 year.  The existence of other neurological or psychiatric conditions [these include childhood-onset involuntary movement disorders such as ''dystonia'', or psychiatric disorders characterized by repetitive behaviors/movements (for example, stereotypic behaviors in ''autism'' and compulsive behaviors in ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'' - ''OCD''] can also help doctors arrive at a diagnosis. Common tics are not often misdiagnosed by knowledgeable clinicians.  But atypical symptoms or atypical presentation (for example, onset of symptoms in adulthood) may require specific specialty expertise for diagnosis. There are no blood or laboratory tests needed for diagnosis, but neuroimaging studies, such as ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), ''computerized tomography'' (CT), and ''electroencephalogram'' (''EEG'') scans, or certain blood tests may be used to rule out other conditions that might be confused with Tourette syndrome.''It is not uncommon for patients to obtain a formal diagnosis of Tourette syndrome only after symptoms have been present for some time. The reasons for this are many. For families and physicians unfamiliar with Tourette syndrome, mild and even moderate tic symptoms may be considered inconsequential, part of a developmental phase, or the result of another condition. For example, parents may think that eye blinking is related to vision problems or that sniffing is related to seasonal ''allergies''. Many patients are self-diagnosed after they, their parents, other relatives, or friends read or hear about Tourette syndrome from others.' "
How is Tourette syndrome treated?,"'Because tic symptoms do not often cause impairment, the majority of people with Tourette syndrome require no medication for tic suppression. However, effective medications are available for those whose symptoms interfere with functioning. Neuroleptics are the most consistently useful medications for tic suppression; a number are available but some are more effective than others (for example, ''haloperidol'' and ''pimozide'').''Unfortunately, there is no one medication that is helpful to all people with Tourette syndrome, nor does any medication completely eliminate symptoms.  In addition, all medications have side effects. Most neuroleptic side effects can be managed by initiating treatment slowly and reducing the dose when side effects occur. The most common side effects of neuroleptics include sedation, ''weight gain'', and cognitive dulling.  Neurological side effects such as ''tremor'', dystonic reactions (twisting movements or postures), parkinsonian-like symptoms, and other dyskinetic (involuntary) movements are less common and are readily managed with dose reduction.''Discontinuing neuroleptics after long-term use must be done slowly to avoid rebound increases in tics and withdrawal dyskinesias. One form of withdrawal ''dyskinesia'' called ''tardive dyskinesia'' is a movement disorder distinct from Tourette syndrome that may result from the chronic use of neuroleptics. The risk of this side effect can be reduced by using lower doses of neuroleptics for shorter periods of time.''Other medications may also be useful for reducing tic severity, but most have not been as extensively studied or shown to be as consistently useful as neuroleptics.  Additional medications with demonstrated efficacy include alpha-adrenergic agonists such as ''clonidine'' and ''guanfacine''. These medications are used primarily for ''hypertension'' but are also used in the treatment of tics. The most common side effect from these medications that precludes their use is sedation.''Effective medications are also available to treat some of the associated neurobehavioral disorders that can occur in patients with Tourette syndrome.  Recent research shows that stimulant medications such as ''methylphenidate'' and ''dextroamphetamine'' can lessen ''ADHD symptoms'' in people with Tourette syndrome without causing tics to become more severe.  However, the product labeling for ''stimulants'' currently contraindicates the use of these ''drugs'' in children with tics/Tourette syndrome and those with a family history of tics. Scientists hope that future studies will include a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of stimulants in those with Tourette syndrome or a family history of Tourette syndrome and will clarify this issue. For obsessive-compulsive symptoms that significantly disrupt daily functioning, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (''clomipramine'', ''fluoxetine'', ''fluvoxamine'', ''paroxetine'', and ''sertraline'') have been proven effective in some patients.  ''Psychotherapy'' may also be helpful. Although psychological problems do not cause Tourette syndrome, such problems may result from Tourette syndrome. Psychotherapy can help the person with Tourette syndrome better cope with the disorder and deal with the secondary social and emotional problems that sometimes occur. More recently, specific behavioral treatments that include awareness training and competing response training, such as voluntarily moving in response to a premonitory urge, have shown effectiveness in small controlled trials. Larger and more definitive NIH-funded studies are underway.' "
Is Tourette syndrome inherited?,"'Evidence from twin and family studies suggests that Tourette syndrome is an ''inherited'' disorder. Although early family studies suggested an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (an autosomal dominant disorder is one in which only one copy of the defective gene, inherited from one parent, is necessary to produce the disorder), more recent studies suggest that the pattern of inheritance is much more complex. Although there may be a few genes with substantial effects, it is also possible that many genes with smaller effects and environmental factors may play a role in the development of Tourette syndrome. Genetic studies also suggest that some forms of ''ADHD'' and ''OCD'' are genetically related to Tourette syndrome, but there is less evidence for a genetic relationship between Tourette syndrome and other neurobehavioral problems that commonly co-occur with Tourette syndrome. It is important for families to understand that genetic predisposition may not necessarily result in full-blown Tourette syndrome; instead, it may express itself as a milder tic disorder or as obsessive-compulsive behaviors. It is also possible that the gene-carrying offspring will not develop any Tourette syndrome symptoms.''The sex of the person also plays an important role in Tourette syndrome gene expression. At-risk males are more likely to have tics and at-risk females are more likely to have obsessive-compulsive symptoms.''People with Tourette syndrome may have genetic risks for other neurobehavioral disorders such as ''depression'' or ''substance abuse''. ''Genetic counseling'' of individuals with Tourette syndrome should include a full review of all potentially hereditary conditions in the family.' "
What is the prognosis for Tourette syndrome?,"'Although there is no cure for Tourette syndrome, the condition in many individuals improves in the late teens and early 20s. As a result, some may actually become symptom-free or no longer need medication for tic suppression. Although the disorder is generally lifelong and chronic, it is not a degenerative condition. Individuals with Tourette syndrome have a normal life expectancy. Tourette syndrome does not impair intelligence. Although tic symptoms tend to decrease with age, it is possible that neurobehavioral disorders such as ''depression'', ''panic attacks'', ''mood swings'', and antisocial behaviors can persist and cause impairment in adult life. ' "
What is the best educational setting for children with Tourette syndrome?,"'Although students with Tourette syndrome often function well in the regular classroom, ''ADHD'', ''learning disabilities'"", obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and frequent tics can greatly interfere with academic performance or social adjustment. After a comprehensive assessment, students should be placed in an educational setting that meets their individual needs. Students may require tutoring, smaller or special classes, and in some cases special schools. All students with Tourette syndrome need a tolerant and compassionate setting that both encourages them to work to their full potential and is flexible enough to accommodate their special needs. This setting may include a private study area, exams outside the regular classroom, or even oral exams when the child's symptoms interfere with his or her ability to write. Untimed testing reduces ""'stress'' for students with Tourette syndrome.' "
What research is being done for Tourette syndrome?,"'Within the Federal government, the leading supporter of research on Tourette syndrome and other neurological disorders is the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS). The NINDS, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is responsible for supporting and conducting research on the brain and central nervous system. ''NINDS sponsors research on Tourette syndrome both in its laboratories at the NIH and through grants to major medical institutions across the country. The National Institute of ''Mental Health'', the National Center for Research Resources, the National Institute of ''Child Health'' and Human Development, the National Institute on ''Drug Abuse'', and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders also support research of relevance to Tourette syndrome. And another component of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'', funds professional education programs as well as Tourette syndrome research. ''Knowledge about Tourette syndrome comes from studies across a number of medical and scientific disciplines, including genetics, neuroimaging, neuropathology, ''clinical trials'' (medication and non-medication), epidemiology, neurophysiology, neuroimmunology, and descriptive/diagnostic clinical science. ''Genetic studies.'' Currently, NIH-funded investigators are conducting a variety of large-scale genetic studies. Rapid advances in the technology of gene finding will allow for genome-wide screening approaches in Tourette syndrome, and finding a gene or genes for Tourette syndrome would be a major step toward understanding genetic risk factors. In addition, understanding the genetics of Tourette syndrome genes will strengthen clinical diagnosis, improve genetic counseling, lead to the clarification of pathophysiology, and provide clues for more effective therapies.''Neuroimaging studies. ''Within the past 5 years, advances in imaging technology and an increase in trained investigators have led to an increasing use of novel and powerful techniques to identify brain regions, circuitry, and neurochemical factors important in Tourette syndrome and related conditions.''Neuropathology:''  Within the past 5 years, there has been an increase in the number and quality of donated postmortem brains from Tourette syndrome patients available for research purposes.  This increase, coupled with advances in neuropathological techniques, has led to initial findings with implications for neuroimaging studies and animal models of Tourette syndrome. ''Clinical trials:'' A number of clinical trials in Tourette syndrome have recently been completed or are currently underway.  These include studies of stimulant treatment of ADHD in Tourette syndrome and behavioral treatments for reducing tic severity in children and adults. Smaller trials of novel approaches to treatment such as dopamine agonist and GABAergic medications also show promise. ''Epidemiology and clinical science.'' Careful epidemiological studies now estimate the prevalence of Tourette syndrome to be substantially higher than previously thought with a wider range of clinical severity. Furthermore, clinical studies are providing new findings regarding Tourette syndrome and co-existing conditions. These include subtyping studies of Tourette syndrome and OCD, an examination of the link between ADHD and learning problems in children with Tourette syndrome, a new appreciation of sensory tics, and the role of co-existing disorders in rage attacks. One of the most important and controversial areas of Tourette syndrome science involves the relationship between Tourette syndrome and autoimmune ''brain injury'' associated with group A beta-hemolytic ''streptococcal infections'' or other infectious processes. There are a number of epidemiological and clinical investigations currently underway in this intriguing area.' "

Complex motor tics might include facial grimacing combined with a head twist and a shoulder shrug. Other complex motor tics may actually appear purposeful, including sniffing or touching objects, hopping, jumping, bending, or twisting. Simple vocal tics may include throat-clearing, sniffing/snorting, grunting, or barking. More complex vocal tics include words or phrases.  Perhaps the most dramatic and disabling tics include motor movements that result in self-harm such as punching oneself in the face or vocal tics including coprolalia (uttering swear words) or ''echolalia'' (repeating the words or phrases of others). Some tics are preceded by an urge or sensation in the affected muscle group, commonly called a premonitory urge. ''Some with Tourette syndrome will describe a need to complete a tic in a certain way or a certain number of times in order to relieve the urge or decrease the sensation. ''Tics are often worse with excitement or ''anxiety'' and better during calm, focused activities. Certain physical experiences can trigger or worsen tics, for example tight collars may trigger neck tics, or ''hearing'' another person sniff or throat-clear may trigger similar sounds. Tics do not go away during ''sleep'' but are often significantly diminished.' "
What is the course of Tourette syndrome?,"'Tics come and go over time, varying in type, frequency, location, and severity.  The first symptoms usually occur in the head and neck area and may progress to include muscles of the trunk and extremities. Motor tics generally precede the development of vocal tics and simple tics often precede complex tics.  Most patients experience peak tic severity before the mid-teen years with improvement for the majority of patients in the late teen years and early adulthood. Approximately 10 percent of those affected have a progressive or disabling course that lasts into adulthood.' "
Can people with Tourette syndrome control their tics?,"'Although the symptoms of Tourette syndrome are involuntary, some people can sometimes suppress, camouflage, or otherwise manage their tics in an effort to minimize their impact on functioning. However, people with Tourette syndrome often report a substantial buildup in tension when suppressing their tics to the point where they feel that the tic must be expressed. Tics in response to an environmental trigger can appear to be voluntary or purposeful but are not. ' "
What causes Tourette syndrome?,"'Although the cause of Tourette syndrome is unknown, current research points to abnormalities in certain brain regions (including the basal ganglia, frontal lobes, and cortex), the circuits that interconnect these regions, and the neurotransmitters (''dopamine'', serotonin, and norepinephrine) responsible for communication among nerve cells. Given the often complex presentation of Tourette syndrome, the cause of the disorder is likely to be equally complex.' "
What disorders are associated with Tourette syndrome?,"'Many with Tourette syndrome experience additional neurobehavioral problems including ''inattention''; ''hyperactivity'' and ''impulsivity'' (''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder''-''ADHD'') and related problems with reading, writing, and arithmetic; and obsessive-compulsive symptoms such as intrusive thoughts/worries and repetitive behaviors. For example, worries about dirt and germs may be associated with repetitive hand-washing, and concerns about bad things happening may be associated with ritualistic behaviors such as counting, repeating, or ordering and arranging.  People with Tourette syndrome have also reported problems with ''depression'' or ''anxiety'' disorders, as well as other difficulties with living, that may or may not be directly related to Tourette syndrome.  Given the range of potential complications, people with Tourette syndrome are best served by receiving medical care that provides a comprehensive treatment plan.' "
How is Tourette syndrome diagnosed?,"'Tourette syndrome is a diagnosis that doctors make after verifying that the patient has had both motor and vocal tics for at least 1 year.  The existence of other neurological or psychiatric conditions [these include childhood-onset involuntary movement disorders such as ''dystonia'', or psychiatric disorders characterized by repetitive behaviors/movements (for example, stereotypic behaviors in ''autism'' and compulsive behaviors in ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'' - ''OCD''] can also help doctors arrive at a diagnosis. Common tics are not often misdiagnosed by knowledgeable clinicians.  But atypical symptoms or atypical presentation (for example, onset of symptoms in adulthood) may require specific specialty expertise for diagnosis. There are no blood or laboratory tests needed for diagnosis, but neuroimaging studies, such as ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), ''computerized tomography'' (CT), and ''electroencephalogram'' (''EEG'') scans, or certain blood tests may be used to rule out other conditions that might be confused with Tourette syndrome.''It is not uncommon for patients to obtain a formal diagnosis of Tourette syndrome only after symptoms have been present for some time. The reasons for this are many. For families and physicians unfamiliar with Tourette syndrome, mild and even moderate tic symptoms may be considered inconsequential, part of a developmental phase, or the result of another condition. For example, parents may think that eye blinking is related to vision problems or that sniffing is related to seasonal ''allergies''. Many patients are self-diagnosed after they, their parents, other relatives, or friends read or hear about Tourette syndrome from others.' "
How is Tourette syndrome treated?,"'Because tic symptoms do not often cause impairment, the majority of people with Tourette syndrome require no medication for tic suppression. However, effective medications are available for those whose symptoms interfere with functioning. Neuroleptics are the most consistently useful medications for tic suppression; a number are available but some are more effective than others (for example, ''haloperidol'' and ''pimozide'').''Unfortunately, there is no one medication that is helpful to all people with Tourette syndrome, nor does any medication completely eliminate symptoms.  In addition, all medications have side effects. Most neuroleptic side effects can be managed by initiating treatment slowly and reducing the dose when side effects occur. The most common side effects of neuroleptics include sedation, ''weight gain'', and cognitive dulling.  Neurological side effects such as ''tremor'', dystonic reactions (twisting movements or postures), parkinsonian-like symptoms, and other dyskinetic (involuntary) movements are less common and are readily managed with dose reduction.''Discontinuing neuroleptics after long-term use must be done slowly to avoid rebound increases in tics and withdrawal dyskinesias. One form of withdrawal ''dyskinesia'' called ''tardive dyskinesia'' is a movement disorder distinct from Tourette syndrome that may result from the chronic use of neuroleptics. The risk of this side effect can be reduced by using lower doses of neuroleptics for shorter periods of time.''Other medications may also be useful for reducing tic severity, but most have not been as extensively studied or shown to be as consistently useful as neuroleptics.  Additional medications with demonstrated efficacy include alpha-adrenergic agonists such as ''clonidine'' and ''guanfacine''. These medications are used primarily for ''hypertension'' but are also used in the treatment of tics. The most common side effect from these medications that precludes their use is sedation.''Effective medications are also available to treat some of the associated neurobehavioral disorders that can occur in patients with Tourette syndrome.  Recent research shows that stimulant medications such as ''methylphenidate'' and ''dextroamphetamine'' can lessen ''ADHD symptoms'' in people with Tourette syndrome without causing tics to become more severe.  However, the product labeling for ''stimulants'' currently contraindicates the use of these ''drugs'' in children with tics/Tourette syndrome and those with a family history of tics. Scientists hope that future studies will include a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of stimulants in those with Tourette syndrome or a family history of Tourette syndrome and will clarify this issue. For obsessive-compulsive symptoms that significantly disrupt daily functioning, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (''clomipramine'', ''fluoxetine'', ''fluvoxamine'', ''paroxetine'', and ''sertraline'') have been proven effective in some patients.  ''Psychotherapy'' may also be helpful. Although psychological problems do not cause Tourette syndrome, such problems may result from Tourette syndrome. Psychotherapy can help the person with Tourette syndrome better cope with the disorder and deal with the secondary social and emotional problems that sometimes occur. More recently, specific behavioral treatments that include awareness training and competing response training, such as voluntarily moving in response to a premonitory urge, have shown effectiveness in small controlled trials. Larger and more definitive NIH-funded studies are underway.' "
Is Tourette syndrome inherited?,"'Evidence from twin and family studies suggests that Tourette syndrome is an ''inherited'' disorder. Although early family studies suggested an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (an autosomal dominant disorder is one in which only one copy of the defective gene, inherited from one parent, is necessary to produce the disorder), more recent studies suggest that the pattern of inheritance is much more complex. Although there may be a few genes with substantial effects, it is also possible that many genes with smaller effects and environmental factors may play a role in the development of Tourette syndrome. Genetic studies also suggest that some forms of ''ADHD'' and ''OCD'' are genetically related to Tourette syndrome, but there is less evidence for a genetic relationship between Tourette syndrome and other neurobehavioral problems that commonly co-occur with Tourette syndrome. It is important for families to understand that genetic predisposition may not necessarily result in full-blown Tourette syndrome; instead, it may express itself as a milder tic disorder or as obsessive-compulsive behaviors. It is also possible that the gene-carrying offspring will not develop any Tourette syndrome symptoms.''The sex of the person also plays an important role in Tourette syndrome gene expression. At-risk males are more likely to have tics and at-risk females are more likely to have obsessive-compulsive symptoms.''People with Tourette syndrome may have genetic risks for other neurobehavioral disorders such as ''depression'' or ''substance abuse''. ''Genetic counseling'' of individuals with Tourette syndrome should include a full review of all potentially hereditary conditions in the family.' "
What is the prognosis for Tourette syndrome?,"'Although there is no cure for Tourette syndrome, the condition in many individuals improves in the late teens and early 20s. As a result, some may actually become symptom-free or no longer need medication for tic suppression. Although the disorder is generally lifelong and chronic, it is not a degenerative condition. Individuals with Tourette syndrome have a normal life expectancy. Tourette syndrome does not impair intelligence. Although tic symptoms tend to decrease with age, it is possible that neurobehavioral disorders such as ''depression'', ''panic attacks'', ''mood swings'', and antisocial behaviors can persist and cause impairment in adult life. ' "
What is the best educational setting for children with Tourette syndrome?,"'Although students with Tourette syndrome often function well in the regular classroom, ''ADHD'', ''learning disabilities'"", obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and frequent tics can greatly interfere with academic performance or social adjustment. After a comprehensive assessment, students should be placed in an educational setting that meets their individual needs. Students may require tutoring, smaller or special classes, and in some cases special schools. All students with Tourette syndrome need a tolerant and compassionate setting that both encourages them to work to their full potential and is flexible enough to accommodate their special needs. This setting may include a private study area, exams outside the regular classroom, or even oral exams when the child's symptoms interfere with his or her ability to write. Untimed testing reduces ""'stress'' for students with Tourette syndrome.' "
What research is being done for Tourette syndrome?,"'Within the Federal government, the leading supporter of research on Tourette syndrome and other neurological disorders is the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and ''Stroke'' (NINDS). The NINDS, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is responsible for supporting and conducting research on the brain and central nervous system. ''NINDS sponsors research on Tourette syndrome both in its laboratories at the NIH and through grants to major medical institutions across the country. The National Institute of ''Mental Health'', the National Center for Research Resources, the National Institute of ''Child Health'' and Human Development, the National Institute on ''Drug Abuse'', and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders also support research of relevance to Tourette syndrome. And another component of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'', funds professional education programs as well as Tourette syndrome research. ''Knowledge about Tourette syndrome comes from studies across a number of medical and scientific disciplines, including genetics, neuroimaging, neuropathology, ''clinical trials'' (medication and non-medication), epidemiology, neurophysiology, neuroimmunology, and descriptive/diagnostic clinical science. ''Genetic studies.'' Currently, NIH-funded investigators are conducting a variety of large-scale genetic studies. Rapid advances in the technology of gene finding will allow for genome-wide screening approaches in Tourette syndrome, and finding a gene or genes for Tourette syndrome would be a major step toward understanding genetic risk factors. In addition, understanding the genetics of Tourette syndrome genes will strengthen clinical diagnosis, improve genetic counseling, lead to the clarification of pathophysiology, and provide clues for more effective therapies.''Neuroimaging studies. ''Within the past 5 years, advances in imaging technology and an increase in trained investigators have led to an increasing use of novel and powerful techniques to identify brain regions, circuitry, and neurochemical factors important in Tourette syndrome and related conditions.''Neuropathology:''  Within the past 5 years, there has been an increase in the number and quality of donated postmortem brains from Tourette syndrome patients available for research purposes.  This increase, coupled with advances in neuropathological techniques, has led to initial findings with implications for neuroimaging studies and animal models of Tourette syndrome. ''Clinical trials:'' A number of clinical trials in Tourette syndrome have recently been completed or are currently underway.  These include studies of stimulant treatment of ADHD in Tourette syndrome and behavioral treatments for reducing tic severity in children and adults. Smaller trials of novel approaches to treatment such as dopamine agonist and GABAergic medications also show promise. ''Epidemiology and clinical science.'' Careful epidemiological studies now estimate the prevalence of Tourette syndrome to be substantially higher than previously thought with a wider range of clinical severity. Furthermore, clinical studies are providing new findings regarding Tourette syndrome and co-existing conditions. These include subtyping studies of Tourette syndrome and OCD, an examination of the link between ADHD and learning problems in children with Tourette syndrome, a new appreciation of sensory tics, and the role of co-existing disorders in rage attacks. One of the most important and controversial areas of Tourette syndrome science involves the relationship between Tourette syndrome and autoimmune ''brain injury'' associated with group A beta-hemolytic ''streptococcal infections'' or other infectious processes. There are a number of epidemiological and clinical investigations currently underway in this intriguing area.' "

Preeclampsia Facts*,"'*''Preeclampsia'' facts medically edited by: Melissa Conrad Stöppler, MD' High blood pressure during pregnancy can be dangerous for the mother and baby. Effects of high blood pressure during pregnancy range from mild to severe. Preeclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy) generally begins after the 20th week of pregnancy and is related to increased blood pressure and protein in the mother's urine. Approximately 6% to 8% of women in the U.S. experience high blood pressure during pregnancy. Risk factors for preeclampsia include chronic high blood pressure before becoming pregnant; preeclampsia in previous pregnancies; pregnancy occurring under the age of 20 or over the age of 40, multiple gestation; and previous conditions such as lupus, scleroderma, diabetes, kidney disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Symptoms of preeclampsia include 
	persistent headaches, blurred vision, abdominal pain, and sensitivity to light. There is no single test to diagnose preeclampsia. If you have high blood pressure and are thinking of becoming pregnant; keep your blood pressure under control with lifestyle changes; discuss how high blood pressure may affect you and your baby with your doctor; if you take blood pressure medications; discuss how these medications may affect your baby.
	 While you are pregnant avoid alcohol and 
	tobacco, make sure you receive regular prenatal medical care, and discuss any OTC medications you are taking with your doctor. There is no proven way to prevent preeclampsia."
What Is High Blood Pressure?,"""Blood pressure is the amount of force exerted by the blood against the walls of the arteries. A person's blood pressure is considered high when the readings are greater than 140 mm Hg systolic (the top number in the blood pressure reading) or 90 mm Hg diastolic (the bottom number). In general, high blood pressure, or ""'hypertension'', contributes to the development of coronary ''heart disease'', ''stroke'', ''heart failure'' and kidney disease.' "
What Are the Effects of High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy?,"'Although many pregnant women with high blood pressure have healthy ''babies'' without serious problems, high blood pressure can be dangerous for both the mother and the fetus. Women with pre-existing, or chronic, high blood pressure are more likely to have certain complications during pregnancy than those with normal blood pressure. However, some women develop high blood pressure while they are pregnant (often called gestational ''hypertension'').''The effects of high blood pressure range from mild to severe. High blood pressure can harm the mother\'s kidneys and other organs, and it can cause low birth weight and early delivery. In the most serious cases, the mother develops preeclampsia - or ""toxemia of pregnancy""--which can threaten the lives of both the mother and the fetus.' "
What Is Preeclampsia?,"""Preeclampsia is a condition that typically starts after the 20th week of pregnancy and is related to increased blood pressure and protein in the mother's urine (as a result of kidney problems). Preeclampsia affects the placenta, and it can affect the mother's kidney, ""'liver'', and brain. When preeclampsia causes ''seizures'', the condition is known as ''eclampsia''--the second leading cause of maternal death in the U.S. Preeclampsia is also a leading cause of fetal complications, which include low birth weight, premature birth, and ''stillbirth''.''There is no proven way to prevent preeclampsia. Most women who develop signs of preeclampsia, however, are closely monitored to lessen or avoid related problems. The only way to ""cure"" preeclampsia is to deliver the baby.'  "
How Common Are High Blood Pressure and Preeclampsia in Pregnancy?,"'High blood pressure problems occur in 6 percent to 8 percent of all pregnancies in the U.S., about 70 percent of which are first-time pregnancies. In 1998, more than 146,320 cases of preeclampsia alone were diagnosed.''Although the proportion of pregnancies with gestational ''hypertension'' and ''eclampsia'' has remained about the same in the U.S. over the past decade, the rate of preeclampsia has increased by nearly one-third. This increase is due in part to a rise in the numbers of older mothers and of multiple births, where preeclampsia occurs more frequently. For example, in 1998 birth rates among women ages 30 to 44 and the number of births to women ages 45 and older were at the highest levels in 3 decades, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Furthermore, between 1980 and 1998, rates of twin births increased about 50 percent overall and 1,000 percent among women ages 45 to 49; rates of triplet and other higher-order multiple births jumped more than 400 percent overall, and 1,000 percent among women in their 40s.' "
Who Is More Likely to Develop Preeclampsia?," Women with chronic hypertension (high blood pressure before becoming pregnant). 
 Women who developed high blood pressure or preeclampsia during a previous pregnancy, especially if these conditions occurred early in the pregnancy. 
 Women who are obese prior to pregnancy. 
 Pregnant women under the age of 20 or over the age of 40. 
 Women who are pregnant with more than one baby. 
 Women with diabetes, kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or scleroderma. 

	"
What Are the Symptoms of Preeclampsia and How Is It Detected?,"'Unfortunately, there is no single test to predict or diagnose preeclampsia. Key signs are increased blood pressure and ''protein in the urine'' (''proteinuria''). Other symptoms that seem to occur with preeclampsia include persistent ''headaches'', blurred vision or sensitivity to light, and ''abdominal pain''.''All of these sensations can be caused by other disorders; they can also occur in healthy pregnancies. Regular visits with your doctor help him or her to track your blood pressure and level of protein in your urine, to order and analyze blood tests that detect signs of preeclampsia, and to monitor ''fetal development'' more closely.' "
How Can Women with High Blood Pressure Prevent Problems During Pregnancy?,"'If you are thinking about having a baby and you have high blood pressure, talk first to your doctor or nurse. Taking steps to control your blood pressure before and during pregnancy-and getting regular ''prenatal care'""-go a long way toward ensuring your well-being and your baby's health. ""'Before becoming pregnant: ''While you are pregnant: '  Be sure your blood pressure is under control. Lifestyle changes such as limiting your salt intake, participating in regular physical activity, and losing weight if you are overweight can be helpful.  
 Discuss with your doctor how hypertension might affect you and your baby during pregnancy, and what you can do to prevent or lessen problems.  
 If you take medicines for your blood pressure, ask your doctor whether you should change the amount you take or stop taking them during pregnancy. Experts currently recommend avoiding 
	angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 
	Angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists during pregnancy; other blood pressure medications may be OK for you to use. Do not, however, stop or change your medicines unless your doctor tells you to do so. 
 	 Obtain regular prenatal medical care.  Avoid alcohol and tobacco.   Talk to your doctor about any over-the-counter medications you are taking or are thinking about taking. 
	"
Does Hypertension or Preeclampsia During Pregnancy Cause Long-Term Heart and Blood Vessel Problems?,"""The effects of high blood pressure during pregnancy vary depending on the disorder and other factors. According to the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP), preeclampsia does not in general increase a woman's risk for developing chronic hypertension or other ""'heart''-related problems. The NHBPEP also reports that in women with normal blood pressure who develop preeclampsia after the 20th week of their first pregnancy, short-term complications-including increased blood pressure-usually go away within about 6 weeks after delivery. ''Some women, however, may be more likely to develop high blood pressure or other ''heart disease'' later in life. More research is needed to determine the long-term health effects of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and to develop better methods for identifying, diagnosing, and treating women at risk for these conditions. ''Even though high blood pressure and related disorders during pregnancy can be serious, most women with high blood pressure and those who develop preeclampsia have successful pregnancies. Obtaining early and regular prenatal care is the most important thing you can do for you and your baby.' "
What is toxic shock syndrome?,"'Toxic shock syndrome is a severe illness associated with group A ''Streptococcus'' (''GAS'' or ''Streptococcus pyogenes''); this bacterium produces a toxin termed TSS toxin-1 (TSST-, or phage-group-1 streptococcal toxic shock syndrome). TSS was first described in 1978 in children, but subsequent reports identified TSS outbreaks in women who use tampons. Although first thought to be additionally associated with ''menstruation'', over the past years, less than half of TTS cases have been ''menstruation''-related. Although most cases of TTS occur in women who menstruate, about 25% of infections occur in men. TSS is also associated with ''Staphylococcus'' infections; some ''strains'' of these bacteria produce exotoxins very similar to TSST-1.'  "
How do you get toxic shock syndrome?,"'The cause of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is one of several closely related exotoxins secreted by bacteria that are infecting the person. The toxins (also termed superantigens) activate T cells of the immune system to produce chemicals known as cytokines that subsequently cause shock and tissue damage.''The superantigens have a unique way of interacting with the immune system. Although there are several closely related exotoxins, about 80% of individuals with TSS have an illness caused by TSST-1 or a similar exotoxin. Other exotoxins such as those produced by enterococci A, C, D, E, and H cause most of the remaining 20% of infections.''M protein, a filamentous protein on the cell membrane of group A ''Streptococcus'' bacteria enhances the likelihood of the bacterial strain being more likely to cause disease. Bacterial strains that lack M protein are less lethal because M protein can protect bacteria from host immune defenses. In addition, M protein apparently enhances cell damage and inflammation caused by exotoxins.' "
What are risk factors for toxic shock syndrome?,"'Risk factors for TSS include a history of using high-absorbency tampons, surgical wounds, history of using a ''diaphragm'' or ''contraceptive sponge'', having a localized ''deep skin infection'', abortion, ''burns'', and immunosuppression (for example, as seen with ''diabetes'', chronic lung or ''heart disease'', or in elderly patients).''Not recognizing TTS symptoms while using a tampon can be a serious mistake. For example, Sara Manitoski, a 16-year-old who was on an overnight school trip, complained of ''stomach cramps'' before she went to bed. The following morning, she was found unresponsive. She ultimately died, and the ''autopsy'' revealed that she died from TTS.' "
What are toxic shock syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'TSS symptoms and signs a resemble those found in other infections; however, the most common symptoms of TSS are as follows:''Skin shedding may occur on the palms and soles of the ''feet'' about one or two weeks after the initial infection begins.''Some doctors classify TSS cases by stages -- others do not. However, early symptoms such as a high fever and a falling ''blood pressure'' (shock-like symptoms) may occur before later stages of organ damage appear. Early symptoms are ''flu-like'' and can be confused with those of other diseases, like ''norovirus'' or other viral and bacterial infections, especially in young women.'  Fever higher than 38.9 C (102 F) Low blood pressure (about <90 systolic); lightheadedness Decreased kidney function Disturbances in blood clotting (platelets less than or equal to 100,000/mm3) Liver involvement (twice the upper limit of normal for liver enzyme measurements) Acute respiratory distress Vomiting A sunburn-like red rash that's flat and/or shedding of the skin (erythroderma) Damage and death of soft tissues, such as necrotizing fasciitis, myositis, or gangrene due to flesh-eating bacterial infections Fatigue Headache Muscle aches"
How is toxic shock syndrome diagnosed?,"'In general, after the history and physical, if the patient has ''low blood pressure'' and multiorgan involvement characterized by two of the above listed symptoms of organ dysfunction (renal, lung, liver, skin, or blood), the clinical diagnosis of TSS is made, according to CDC criteria. A confirmation of the diagnosis is done by isolation of one of the causative bacteria; the bacteria should be identified as capable of producing exotoxin that either is, or functions like, TSST-1.' "
What is the treatment for toxic shock syndrome?,"'The treatment for TSS varies from patient to patient; however, the following treatments are fairly common. Patients with TSS usually will be treated with two or more of the following treatments:' Intravenous fluids to treat shock IV antibiotics Deep surgical cleaning of any infected wounds Cardiac medications to help treat low blood pressure Oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation as needed Blood products if needed Dialysis for patients with kidney failure Hospitalization in an intensive-care unit"
What is the prognosis of toxic shock syndrome?,"'Patients with TSS who are diagnosed early and given appropriate treatment often have a good prognosis. Early treatment can help prevent life-threatening complications such as ''renal failure'', respiratory failure, and coagulation disorders. However, the mortality (death) rate is about 5%-15%, and patients who develop complications have a poorer prognosis than those who do not. Patients who develop TSS are at risk for reinfection.' "
How can I prevent toxic shock syndrome?,"'It is possible to reduce the chances of developing TSS. Menstruating females should minimize use of items like tampons, diaphragms, and sponges. Women should change tampons frequently and avoid super-absorbent tampons. For example, polyester, carboxymethylcellulose, and polyacrylate rayon, which increase tampon absorbency, have been removed from tampons because they were associated with increased TSS toxin production. Anyone diagnosed with TSS has a higher risk of reinfection. Women diagnosed with TSS should avoid tampon use in the future. Your ob-gyn doctor may provide additional recommendations. Early treatment of wounds, especially deep wounds, can help prevent TSS.' "
What is an autopsy?,"'An autopsy (also known as a post-mortem examination or necropsy) is the examination of the body of a dead person and is performed primarily to determine the cause of death, to identify or characterize the extent of disease states that the person may have had, or to determine whether a particular medical or surgical treatment has been effective. Autopsies are performed by pathologists, medical doctors who have received specialty training in the diagnosis of diseases by the examination of body fluids and tissues. In academic institutions, autopsies sometimes are also requested for teaching and research purposes. Forensic autopsies have legal implications and are performed to determine if death was an accident, homicide, ''suicide'', or a natural event. The word autopsy is derived from the Greek word autopsia: ""to see with one\'s own eyes.""' "
Who determines whether an autopsy is performed?,"'A medical examiner can order an autopsy without the consent of the next-of-kin. Deaths that are investigated by the medical examiner or coroner include all suspicious deaths, and, depending upon the jurisdiction, may include deaths of persons not being treated by a physician for a known medical condition, deaths of those who have been under medical care for less than 24 hours, or deaths that occurred during operations or other medical procedures.''In all other cases, consent must be obtained from the next-of-kin before an autopsy is performed, even at academic institutions or hospitals. The next-of-kin also has the right to limit the scope of the autopsy (for example, excluding the brain from evaluation or limiting the procedure to examination of the abdomen).' "
How is an autopsy performed?,"'The extent of an autopsy can vary from the examination of a single organ such as the ''heart'' or brain, to a very extensive examination. Examination of the chest, abdomen, and brain is probably considered by most pathologists as the standard scope of the autopsy.''The autopsy begins with a complete external examination. The weight and height of the body are recorded, and identifying marks such as ''scars'' and tattoos also are recorded.''The internal examination begins with the creation of a Y or U- shaped incision from both shoulders joining over the sternum and continuing down to the pubic bone. The skin and underlying tissues are then separated to expose the rib cage and abdominal ''cavity''. The front of the rib cage is removed to expose the neck and chest organs. This opening allows the trachea (windpipe), thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, ''esophagus'', heart, thoracic ''aorta'' and ''lungs'' to be removed. Following removal of the neck and chest organs, the abdominal organs are cut (dissected) free. These include the ''intestines'', ''liver'', gallbladder and bile duct system, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, abdominal aorta, and reproductive organs.''To remove the brain, an incision is made in the back of the skull from one ear to the other. The ''scalp'' is cut and separated from the underlying skull and pulled forward. The top of the skull is removed using a vibrating saw. The entire brain is then gently lifted out of the cranial vault. The spinal cord may also be taken by removing the anterior or posterior portion of the spinal column.''The organs are first examined by the pathologist to note any changes visible with the naked eye. Examples of diseases that may produce changes readily recognizable in the organs include ''atherosclerosis'', ''cirrhosis'' of the liver, and ''coronary artery disease'' in the heart. ''After the organs are removed from the body, they usually are separated from each other and further dissected to reveal any abnormalities, such as tumors, on the inside. Small samples are typically taken from all organs to be made into slide preparations for examination under a microscope. At the end of an autopsy, the incisions made in the body are sewn closed. The organs may be returned to the body or may be retained for teaching, research, and diagnostic purposes. Performance of an autopsy does not interfere with an open casket funeral service, as none of the incisions made in order to accomplish the autopsy are apparent after embalming and dressing of the body by the mortician.' "
What other special studies may be done as part of the autopsy?,"'Pictures of findings may be taken for future reference. Special studies may include cultures to identify infectious agents, chemical analysis for the measurement of drug levels or metabolic abnormalities, or genetic studies. Tissue may be frozen for future diagnostic or research purposes. Organs may be preserved and stored in formalin for later examination, sampling for microscopy, presentation at conferences, or archiving for the training of medical students.' "
What is the autopsy report?,"""After all studies are completed, a detailed report is prepared that describes the autopsy procedure and microscopic findings, gives a list of medical diagnoses, and a summary of the case. The report emphasizes the relationship or correlation between clinical findings (the doctor's examination, laboratory tests, radiology findings, etc.) and pathologic findings (those made from the autopsy)."" "
Why is the autopsy rate declining?,"'Beginning in the 1950s, hospital autopsy rates started falling from an average of around 50% of all deaths to 10% in the late 1990s. Currently, the rates are even lower at non-academic hospitals. In 1970, the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Hospitals dropped the requirement that a hospital needed an autopsy rate of 20% to be accredited.''Family factors:'' Certainly the relationship between patients and their doctors has changed dramatically over the past 50 years due to factors such as specialization, managed care, and the disappearance of the ""house call."" Physicians no longer are ""family doctors"" and do not have the same rapport with patients and their families as in past years. This change in the basic doctor-patient relationship may make it increasingly difficult to obtain consent for an autopsy.''Concerns over disfigurement of the remains or delays in funeral arrangements may prevent a vast majority of families from consenting to an autopsy. In reality, however, the visual examination of the body and the removal of tissues and organs for microscopic examination can be completed in a few hours. Furthermore, there are no visible external changes that would preclude an open-casket funeral service.''In the majority of cases and certainly at academic medical centers, there is currently no charge to the family and frequently, no compensation for its performance. More recently, though, some institutions have started to charge and private autopsies at the request of family members that are performed outside of the hospital may cost several thousand dollars.''Clinician factors: ''Most physicians are generally uncomfortable requesting an autopsy because it is not an easy or pleasant task. If, in addition, a physician feels that a family questions the care that their relative was given, the physician may be reluctant to request an autopsy that might prove that the care was indeed incorrect.''Many individuals in medicine feel that modern technology has made the autopsy outdated or obsolete. With modern imaging studies and laboratory tests, it is thought that the autopsy is unlikely to reveal any conditions that were not detected clinically. The accuracy of the clinical diagnosis has been the subject of numerous research studies. These studies have consistently shown that in 20% to 40% of autopsied patients, there were important, treatable conditions that were detected at autopsy that were not diagnosed clinically. This consistent and significant discrepancy between clinical and pathologic diagnoses is probably the most compelling argument for continued efforts to revive the autopsy as the ""gold standard"" in evaluating the quality of medical care.''Pathologist factors: ''Some doctors express dissatisfaction with the quality of an autopsy if the pathologist does not provide answers regarding the case. Unfortunately, an autopsy does not guarantee that the cause of death, for example a heart ''arrhythmia'', will be identified.'""Autopsy pathology is a vanishing subspecialty, which, for the most part, has been relegated to a secondary position. At the turn of the century, most of the pathologist's activities revolved around the autopsy. Since that time, laboratory medicine and surgical pathology (examining tissue biopsies from living patients) have become the major activities of practicing pathologists.""'In addition, the autopsy is not one of the favorite activities among the majority of pathologists. For many pathologists, an autopsy is an extra burden with no compensation during a busy day.' "
What are the benefits of autopsies?,"'Benefits for families:'"" For families, the autopsy has both tangible and psychological benefits. Uncertainty regarding the cause of an individual's death can delay payment of insurance benefits. The autopsy can also uncover genetic or environmental (for example, a bacterium or fungus) causes of disease that could affect other family members. Psychologically, the autopsy provides closure by identifying or confirming the cause of death. The autopsy can demonstrate to the family that the care provided was appropriate, thereby alleviating guilt among family members and offering reassurance regarding the quality of medical care. Lastly, the autopsy is a mechanism that enables the family to participate in medical education and research.""'Benefits for the clinician and hospital:'' The procedure can confirm the accuracy of the clinical diagnoses and the appropriateness of medical care. The autopsy findings can be utilized to educate physicians, nurses, residents, and students, thereby contributing to an improved quality of care.''Benefits to society:'' Many of the benefits of the autopsy are experienced by society as a whole. The autopsy aids in the evaluation of new diagnostic tests, the assessment of new therapeutic interventions (''drugs'', devices, surgical techniques), and the investigation of environmental and occupational diseases. Autopsy data are useful in establishing valid mortality statistics. Data derived from death certificates in the absence of autopsy data have repeatedly been shown to be inaccurate. New medical knowledge on existing diseases that is derived from autopsy-based research is clearly important for everyone. Remarkably, new diseases continue to emerge which can only be fully investigated by autopsy.' "
Who pays for autopsies?,"""Presently, there is no direct funding to hospitals or doctors for autopsies. As part of the federal government's Medicare funding to hospitals, reimbursement for autopsies is theoretically included in fixed payments that hospitals receive. Thus, the federal government contends that it is paying for autopsies. Since these funds are not specifically earmarked for autopsies, they may not reach the pathology department or pathologist. Managed care organizations consider the autopsy to be built into their hospital contracts. However, these organizations have stated that they are willing to reimburse for autopsies if and when they are convinced of their value. Sometimes in hospital autopsies performed at the request of physicians, the autopsy is not billed to the patient's family, but they should check with the hospital performing the service. This is different from autopsies the family requests of private pathologists, which may lead to charges billed to the deceased's next-of-kin.""'In our litigation-oriented society, a growing proportion of private-pay autopsies are motivated by distrust, anger, and a desire to sue the potentially responsible physician(s) and hospital. Several groups of pathologists and business persons throughout the country are marketing their autopsy services through direct mail, newspapers, funeral homes, and online. Whether the quality and objectivity of these private autopsies will match those of general hospitals and academic medical centers remains to be determined.' "
What is the history of the autopsy?,"'The earliest anatomists and pathologists could be considered ancient hunters, butchers, and cooks who had to recognize organs and determine if they were suitably edible. In ancient Babylon, perhaps as early as 3500 BC, autopsies on animals were performed not for the study of disease, but rather for the practice of predicting the future by communicating with divine forces. The intestines and liver were believed to contain messages from divine spirits.'""Galen (131-200 A.D.), a disciple of Hippocrates practicing in ancient Greece, performed surgical dismantling (dissection) of animals and humans. He determined that Hippocrates' theory that disease was due to four circulating humours (""'phlegm'', blood, yellow bile, and black bile) was correct. Galen was a highly respected, powerful, and dogmatic individual who dominated the medical thinking of his time and for hundreds of years to follow. It is said that the four humour doctrine paralyzed medical science for about 1400 years.''In general, before 1700 there was a negative attitude regarding dissection of the ''human body''. Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and medieval Europeans performed dissections for religious reasons or to learn anatomy, but this was not done in any systematic fashion. There were, however, some notable exceptions. In the late 1200s the law faculty dominated the University of Bologna and would order autopsies to be performed to help solve legal problems. Thus, some of the earliest autopsies were medicolegal cases. In the late 1400s in Padua and Bologna, Italy, the sites of the world\'s first medical schools, Pope Sixtus the IV issued an edict permitting dissection of the human body by medical students. Before such edicts from religious leaders, it was considered a crime to dissect the human body and criminal prosecutions for ""body snatching"" by students of anatomy date back to the early 1300s.''By the 1500s, the autopsy was generally accepted by the Catholic Church, marking the way for an accepted systematic approach for the study of human pathology. While a number of ""giants"" around this time, such as Vesalius (1514-1564), Pare (1510-1590), Lancisi (1654- 1720), and Boerhaave (1668-1738) advanced the autopsy, it is Giovanni Bathista Morgagni (1682-1771) who has been considered the first great autopsist. During his 60 years of observations, Morgagni insisted upon correlation of pathological findings with clinical symptoms, marking the first time that autopsies made major contributions to the understanding of disease in medical science.'""Some historians say that the power of the autopsy in medical education peaked during the 1800s. In the beginning of that century the Allgemeine Krankenhaus in Vienna was considered the premiere medical center of the Western World, in large part because of the stature of its Pathology Institute which was headed by Karl Rokitansky (1804-1878). Almost every patient who died was taken to the Rokitansky Institute, which still exists in Vienna, for autopsy. Rokitansky is said to have supervised 70,000 autopsies, and personally performed over 30,000, averaging two a day, seven days a week, for 45 years. Rokitansky stressed a systematic, almost ritualistic, approach to the autopsy with every patient receiving the same detailed examination. For the sake of objectivity, Rokitansky, unlike Morgagni, did not care to know the clinical history of the patients. Because of this style and his disinclination to apply microscopy in a routine fashion, many of Rokitansky's theories about diseases proved to be incorrect.""'Rudolph Virchow (1821-1902), an eminent German statesman and pathologist, was a younger contemporary and competitor of Rokitansky. Unlike Rokitansky, he grew up with the microscope, and was most influential in the systematic application of microscopy to study disease. Virchow advanced the doctrine which held that cellular pathology was the basis of disease, finally laying to rest the humoural theory of Hippocrates and Galen. In many ways, Virchow could be considered the first molecular biologist. Under Virchow, Berlin replaced Vienna as the premier center of medical education.''Many clinicians, upon returning from study in Berlin, became leaders in North American medicine. The most notable of these physicians was the legendary Sir William Osler, who worked in Canada and the US. Osler was arguably the most respected and revered North American physician of his time. He studied with Rokitansky and Virchow and relied heavily on autopsy studies for his own education. Osler not only performed autopsies himself and taught others from autopsies, but also left detailed instructions for his own autopsy. In speaking of himself, Osler told a friend: ""I\'ve been watching this case for 2 months and I\'m sorry I shall not see the postmortem."" As expected, the autopsy showed that all of Osler\'s diagnoses were correct.''In 1910, Abraham Flexner reported the sorry state of medical education in the U. S. at that time. The Cabot report issued from the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1920, based on approximately 3000 autopsies performed, revealed astonishing diagnostic inaccuracies on the part of clinicians. Resulting medical reforms included the placement of autopsy pathology as a central, integral component of medical education.' "
Should the autopsy be revived?,"'Government agencies that regulate the accreditation of hospitals and ''nursing'' homes are deeply concerned about the decline in autopsy rates. For example, surveys have indicated that less than 1% of nursing home patients who die are autopsied. The U.S. general accounting office, which pays for some nursing home services, recently attempted to prove that particular nursing homes were substandard. Such efforts were thwarted by the lack of hard evidence. The allegations could not be proven because the patients in question were not autopsied and the actual ''causes of death'' could not, therefore, be confirmed.''Some information can only be acquired during an autopsy. The information autopsies can provide benefits society, the medical profession, and families. Many physicians believe that autopsy should be revived. Whether or not it will be revived remains to be seen.' "
What is ciguatera poisoning?,"'Ciguatera is a type of ''food poisoning''. The ciguatera toxin may be found in large reef fish, most commonly barracuda, grouper, red snapper, eel, amberjack, sea bass, and Spanish mackerel. These fish live in coral reef waters between latitudes of 35 degrees south to 35 degrees north, corresponding to the area located between the Tropic of ''Cancer'' and the Tropic of Capricorn. These geographic lines ring the earth north and south of the equator and make up the tropics. These areas include the Caribbean Sea, Hawaii, and coastal Central America.''Ciguatera toxin tends to accumulate in predator fish, such as the Barracuda and other carnivorous reef fish because they eat other fish that consume toxin-producing algae (dinoflagellates) that live in coral reef waters.''Ciguatera toxin is harmless to fish but poisonous to humans. The toxin is odorless and tasteless, and it is heat-resistant, so cooking does not destroy the toxin. Eating ciguatera-contaminated tropical or subtropical fish poisons the person who eats it.'  "
What are the symptoms of ciguatera poisoning?,"'Symptoms of ciguatera poisoning generally begin six to eight hours after eating the contaminated fish.''Symptoms include:''Hot and ''cold'' sensation may be reversed.''Severe cases of ciguatera poisoning may result in tearing of the eyes, ''chills'', skin ''rash'', ''itching'', ''shortness of breath'', ''drooling'', and ''paralysis''. Death due to heart or respiratory failure occurs in rare cases.'   nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, numbness, tingling, abdominal pain, dizziness, and vertigo."
What is the treatment for ciguatera poisoning?,"'If you or someone you know has ingested a fish that you suspect might be contaminated with ciguatera toxin, and you or they have signs or symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, pain, trouble breathing, seizure,  confusion, or abnormal skin color, call either an ambulance or the National Poison Control Center (1-800-222-1222) for guidance. '' ''The poison control center will instruct you what to do.'   The National 
Poison Control Center phone number is 1-800-222-1222. This number is routed to 
the poison control center that serves your area. Place the telephone number 
(along with police, fire, and 911 or equivalent) near your home phones.  Do 
not induce vomiting or give syrup of Ipecac.
Ipecac was formerly used to 
induce vomiting in poisoned patients where there was a chance to get the toxin 
out of the body. Several advisory bodies such as the American Association of 
		Poison Control Centers and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended 
that Ipecac NOT be used and that it should not even be kept in the household.

(Benadryl) may help relieve itching. Give 25-50 mg every 6 hours.  Alcohol, 
fish, nuts, and nut oils should be avoided after exposure to ciguatera poisoning 
because they may trigger recurrent symptoms. "
When should I see a doctor for ciguatera poisoning?," Severe cases of ciguatera poisoning require hospitalization for intravenous 
fluids.  If you think you may have ciguatera poisoning, seek immediate 
medical attention.  A doctor should be consulted in every case about 
treatment for ciguatera poisoning, including available medications. "
What is toxoplasmosis?,"'Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a single-celled protozoan parasite called ''Toxoplasma gondii'', which usually affects warm-blooded animals, including humans. The infection is most commonly acquired from contact with cats and their feces or with raw or undercooked meat.''The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) estimates that more than 60 million people in the United States may carry the ''Toxoplasma gondii'"" parasite, and it infects up to one-third of the world's population, but very few have symptoms because a healthy immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness."" "
What is the cause of toxoplasmosis?,"'There are only a few ways to acquire the ''Toxoplasma gondii ''parasite:''Cats are the most common host for ''Toxoplasma gondii''. Oocysts, one of the life cycle stages of ''T. gondii'', are shed in cat feces, which can transmit the infection when ingested orally. Warm-blooded animals, including humans, pigs, cows, goats, and deer, can serve as an intermediate host in which tissue ''cysts'' (containing bradyzoites) develop. Infection can also occur due to accidental ingestion of these tissue cysts when undercooked or raw meat is eaten. ' Contact with cats or cat feces Eating raw or undercooked meat Drinking raw milk from an infected goat (Goats can be an intermediate host for the parasite.) Organ transplantation or blood transfusion from an infected person"
What are risk factors for acquiring toxo?,"'The following risk factors and situations potentially expose a person to the ''Toxoplasma gondii'' parasite and increase the risk of acquiring toxoplasmosis infection:''If a woman is ''pregnant'' when she is infected with toxo, the infection can be transmitted to the baby with sometimes catastrophic consequences.'  Touching your hands to your mouth after gardening, cleaning a cat's litter box, or anything that came into contact with cat feces Eating raw or partly cooked meat, especially pork, lamb, or venison Using utensils or cutting boards that have not been properly cleaned after they have had contact with raw meat Drinking raw goat's milk Touching your hands to your mouth after contact with raw or undercooked meat Organ transplantation or transfusion (this is rare)"
What are the usual symptoms of toxoplasmosis?,"'Although people infected with toxoplasmosis are often unaware of having this disease, typical symptoms of toxo are flulike symptoms, including ''swollen lymph nodes'' and muscle aches and pains that last from a few days to several weeks. If your immune system is normal, you cannot get the infection again.'  "
Why do some people develop severe problems from toxo?,"'Few people with toxoplasmosis infection develop symptoms because the immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. However, anyone with a compromised immune system is at risk for serious and even life-threatening problems from toxo. Immunocompromised individuals include those undergoing ''chemotherapy'', people with ''HIV/AIDS'' or other immune disorders, and recent organ-transplant recipients.''In these people, an infection that occurred anytime during life can reactivate and cause the severe symptoms of toxoplasmosis such as damage to the eye, brain, or other organs.''Ocular'' toxoplasmosis, which damages the eyes, can lead to reduced vision, ''blurred vision'', ''pain'' (often with bright light), redness of the eye, and sometimes tearing, according to the CDC.' "
Can toxoplasmosis develop into a more serious illness in babies?,"'Yes, the immune system in infants is not fully mature until after birth. Congenital toxoplasmosis occurs when a fetus is infected.''The ''babies'' of women who were exposed to toxo within a few months of ''becoming pregnant'' or during pregnancy are at an increased risk for developing a severe case of toxo. Pregnant women who newly contract the toxoplasmosis parasite have a 20% chance of transmitting it to their unborn child, according to the Organization of Teratology Specialists. When the mother is infected in the ''first trimester'', there is a 10%-15% chance of passing the parasite on to her child. In the U.S., it is estimated that up to 4,000 babies are born with congenital toxoplasmosis annually. Women who were first exposed to toxo more than six months before becoming pregnant are not likely to pass the infection to their children.''Most newborns have no symptoms, but a small percentage may be born with ''birth defects'' such as congenital eye or ''brain damage''. Unfortunately, the signs and symptoms of the disease often appear a few months after birth.''Some signs of congenital toxoplasmosis may be present at birth, such as ''jaundice'', skin ''rash'', and ''enlarged lymph nodes''.' "
"What is meant by a baby developing ""a more severe case of toxo""?","'Children born with toxoplasmosis can be afflicted with birth defects, including intellectual disabilities, convulsions, ''spasticity'', ''cerebral palsy'"", deafness, and severely impaired vision. The infant's head may be abnormally small (""'microcephaly'') or abnormally large due to increased pressure on the brain (''hydrocephalus'').' "
What tests do health care providers use to diagnose toxo in the lab?,"'A toxoplasmosis blood test checks for the presence of ''Toxoplasma gondii'' in the blood. The results can determine if the patient has had toxo and whether the infection is recent (""acute"") or not.' "
Is it possible to prevent toxoplasmosis?,"'Since ''Toxoplasma gondii'"" infection usually causes mild to no symptoms, and a healthy immune system prevents any remaining parasites in the body from causing further symptoms, most people don't need to worry about getting this disease. Currently, there is no ""'vaccine'' for toxoplasmosis in humans.''However, if you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant, there are several steps you should take to prevent exposure to toxoplasmosis.' If you have a weakened immune system, get a blood test for toxoplasmosis. If your test is positive, your doctor can tell you if and when you need to take medicine to prevent the infection from reactivating. If you are planning on becoming pregnant, talk to a doctor about being tested for toxo. If the test is positive, there is no need to worry about passing the infection to your baby (since you should have immunity against the parasite). If you are already pregnant, you should discuss your risk of toxoplasmosis with your doctor who may order a blood sample for testing. Wear gloves when you garden or do anything outdoors that involves handling soil since cats often use gardens and sandboxes as litter boxes. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water after outdoor activities, especially before you eat or prepare food. Have someone else handle raw meat for you. If this is not possible, wear clean latex or nitrile gloves and thoroughly wash with soap and hot water any cutting boards, sinks, knives, and other utensils that might have touched the raw meat. Wash your hands well with soap and warm water afterward. Cook all meat thoroughly, especially pork or veal. Take note of the recommendations listed below regarding cats."
Am I able to keep my cat?,"'Yes, but if you have a weakened immune system or are pregnant, there are some steps to take to avoid being exposed to toxo, according to the Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine.'""Most importantly, you can help prevent your cats from getting infected with toxo. Feed them dry or canned cat food and keep them indoors. Cats can become infected by eating or being fed raw or undercooked meat that is infected with the parasite, or by eating infected prey such as birds or rodents. Any cat that is allowed access to outdoors should be kept off beds, pillows, or other furniture that you also use. Don't bring a new cat into your house that might have been an outdoor cat or might have been fed raw meat. Avoid handling stray cats and kittens. Have your cat tested for the parasite. Your vet can answer any other questions you may have regarding your cat and the risk for toxoplasmosis.""""Have someone who is healthy and not pregnant change your cat's litter box. If this is not possible, wear gloves and clean the litter box daily (the parasite found in cat feces needs a few days after being passed to become infectious). Wash your hands well with soap and warm water afterward."" "
"Once infected with toxo, is my cat always able to spread the infection to me?","""No, cats can only spread toxo in their feces for a few weeks after they are first infected with the parasite. Like humans, cats rarely have symptoms when first infected, so most people don't know if their cat has been exposed to toxo. Most infected cats appear healthy. There are no good tests available to determine if your cat is passing toxo in its feces."" "
What is the treatment for toxoplasmosis?,"'Once the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is confirmed, you and your doctor should discuss whether treatment is necessary. In an otherwise healthy person who is not pregnant, treatment is not needed. Symptoms will usually go away within a few weeks.''For pregnant women or people who have weakened immune systems, ''drugs'' are available to treat the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis. Doctors prescribe drugs in combination, most commonly ''pyrimethamine'' plus ''sulfadiazine'' or trisulfapyrimidines. Pregnant women may also use spiramycin. ' "
What is the prognosis for toxoplasmosis?,"'The majority of people who get toxoplasmosis who have a healthy immune response will have no significant long-term effects.''An infected fetus or infant has a variable prognosis, depending on the severity of the effects of the disease. The earlier the fetus is infected, the worse the prognosis. A woman carrying a severely affected fetus may experience a spontaneous abortion (''miscarriage''), and newborns may develop significant physical or mental problems.''Patients with compromised immune systems have a variable prognosis, depending on their response to treatment. Patients with ''HIV'' or long-term immunocompromised states will need to continue treatment for life. ' "
What is thyroid peroxidase?,"'Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is an enzyme made in the thyroid gland that is important in the production of ''thyroid hormone''.

What does a positive thyroid peroxidase test mean?," Most people with chronic thyroiditis display a positive TPO test. The test is also positive in lesser numbers of people with other thyroid diseases. Other autoimmune disorders that may cause a positive TPOAb test include:Sjogren's syndrome,lupus,rheumatoid arthritis, andpernicious anemia.

What is endotracheal intubation?,"'Endotracheal intubation is a procedure by which a tube is inserted through the mouth down into the trachea (the large ''airway'' from the mouth to the ''lungs''). Before surgery, this is often done under deep sedation. In emergency situations, the patient is often unconscious at the time of this procedure.' "
What kind of tube is used?,'The tube that is used today is usually a flexible ''plastic'' tube. It is called an endotracheal tube because it is slipped within the trachea.' 
How do they put the tube down into the trachea?,"""The doctor often inserts the tube with the help of a laryngoscope, an instrument that permits the doctor to see the upper portion of the trachea, just below the vocal cords. During the procedure the laryngoscope is used to hold the tongue aside while inserting the tube into the trachea. It is important that the head be positioned in the appropriate manner to allow for proper visualization. Pressure is often applied to the thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple) to help with visualization and prevent possible aspiration of stomach contents."" "
What is the purpose of endotracheal intubation?,"'The endotracheal tube serves as an open passage through the upper airway. The purpose of endotracheal intubation is to permit air to pass freely to and from the lungs in order to ventilate the lungs. Endotracheal tubes can be connected to ventilator machines to provide artificial ''respiration''. This can help when a patient is unconscious and by maintaining a patent airway, especially during surgery. It is often used when patients are critically ill and cannot maintain adequate respiratory function to meet their needs. The endotracheal tube facilitates the use of a mechanical ventilator in these critical situations.'  "
Is endotracheal intubation used for COVID-19 coronavirus patients?,"'Endotracheal intubation is the approved way of providing ''breathing'' support to ''COVID-19'"" coronavirus disease patients as of this article's update in early April, 2020.\xa0""'Non-invasive mechanical ventilation\xa0like ''CPAP'' (continuous positive airway pressure) machines used for ''sleep apnea'' are not good for ''COVID-19'"" patients, according to clinical guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists.

This means a better chance of\xa0fighting off the virus, but ventilators can't cure COVID-19."" "
What are the complications of endotracheal intubation?,"'If the tube is inadvertently placed in the ''esophagus'' (right behind the trachea), adequate respirations will not occur. ''Brain damage'', ''cardiac arrest'', and death can occur. Aspiration of stomach contents can result in ''pneumonia'' and ''ARDS''. Placement of the tube too deep can result in only one lung being ventilated and can result in a ''pneumothorax'' as well as inadequate ventilation. During endotracheal tube placement, damage can also occur to the ''teeth'', the soft tissues in the back of the throat, as well as the vocal cords.''This procedure should be performed by a physician with experience in intubation. In the vast majority of cases of intubation, no significant complications occur.'  "
What is a tracheostomy?,'A tracheostomy is a surgically created opening in the neck leading directly to the trachea (the ''breathing'' tube). It is maintained open with a hollow tube called a tracheostomy tube.' 
What are the reasons for a tracheostomy procedure?,"'A tracheostomy is usually done for one of several reasons:'   to bypass an obstructed upper airway (an object obstructing the upper airway will prevent oxygen from the mouth to reach the lungs); to clean and remove secretions from the airway; prolonged mechanical ventilation (breathing machine); and to more easily, and usually more safely, deliver oxygen to the lungs."
What are the risks and complications of a tracheostomy procedure?,"'It is important to understand that a tracheostomy, as with all surgeries, involves potential complications and possible injury from both known and unforeseen causes. Because individuals vary in their tissue circulation and healing processes, as well as anesthetic reactions, ultimately there can be no guarantee made as to the results or potential complications.''Tracheostomies are usually performed during emergency situations or on very ill patients. This patient population is, therefore, at higher risk for a complication during and after the procedure''The following complications have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. It is listed here for information only in order to provide a greater awareness and knowledge concerning the tracheostomy procedure.'""Many of the types of patients who undergo a tracheostomy are seriously ill and have multiple organ-system problems. The doctors will decide on the ideal timing for the tracheostomy based on the patient's status and underlying medical conditions.""   Airway obstruction and aspiration of secretions (rare). Bleeding. In very rare situations, the need for blood products or a blood transfusion. Damage to the larynx (voice box) or airway with resultant permanent change in voice (rare). Need for further and more aggressive surgery Infection Air trapping in the surrounding tissues or chest. In rare situations, a chest tube may be required Scarring of the airway or erosion of the tube into the surrounding structures (rare). Need for a permanent tracheostomy. This is most likely the result of the disease process which made the tracheostomy necessary, and not from the actual procedure itself. Impaired swallowing and vocal function Scarring of the neck"
What happens during a tracheostomy procedure?,"'In most situations, the surgery is performed in the intensive care unit or in the operating room. In either location, the patient is continuously monitored by pulse oximeter (oxygen saturation) and cardiac rhythm (''EKG''). The anesthesiologists usually use a mixture of an intravenous medication and a local anesthetic in order to make the procedure comfortable for the patient.''The surgeon makes an incision low in the neck. The trachea is identified in the middle and an opening is created to allow for the new breathing passage (tracheostomy tube) to be inserted below the voice box (larynx). Newer techniques utilizing special instruments have made it possible to perform this procedure via a percutaneous approach (a less invasive approach using a piercing method rather than an open surgical incision).'  "
What is the recovery care like after a tracheostomy?,"'The surgeons will monitor the healing for several days after the tracheostomy. Usually, the initial tube that was placed at the time of surgery will be changed to a new tube sometime between 10 and 14 days following surgery, depending on the specific circumstances. Subsequent tube changes are usually managed by the treating physician or ''nursing'' staff.''Speech will be difficult until the time comes for a special tube to be placed which may allow talking by allowing the flow of air up to the vocal cords. Any time a patient requires mechanical ventilation, air is prevented from leaking around the tube by a balloon. Therefore, while the patient is on a mechanical ventilator, he/she will be unable to talk. Once the doctors are able to decrease the-size of the tube, speaking may be possible. At the appropriate time, instructions will be given. Oral feeding may also be difficult until a smaller tube is placed.''If the tracheostomy tube will be necessary for a long period of time, the patient and family will be instructed on home care. This will include suctioning of the trachea, and changing and cleaning the tube. When the time comes you will be provided with ample information, instruction, and practice. Often, home healthcare will be provided, or the patient will be transferred to an intermediate health care facility.''In some cases (especially when performed during an emergency or prolonged ''intubation'') the tracheostomy will not be a permanent situation. If the patient can tolerate breathing without the tracheostomy tube the surgical site can be closed, leaving a ''scar'' at the outside of the neck.' "
What is trachoma? Is trachoma contagious?,"'Trachoma is a ''contagious'' bacterial infection that affects the surface of the eyes. Over time, ''scar tissue'' or ulcers can form that lead to blindness. Currently around 1.9 million people worldwide are blind or visually impaired by trachoma, and it remains a public health problem in 44 countries. It spreads when bacteria in the secretions from the eyes of an affected individual extend to others either by person-to-person contact or by eye-seeking flies, particularly the ''Musca sorbens'' fly. It occurs most commonly in endemic communities with ''poor hygiene'' and lack of access to clean water. It is the leading infectious cause of preventable blindness in the world. Approximately 21 million people in the world have active trachoma. The majority of these are children between 3-6 years of age. The disease is found predominantly in dry, arid lands near the equator, with the largest number of cases in sub-Saharan Africa.' "
What are the five stages (types) of trachoma?,"'The World Health Organization created a grading system to classify the five stages of blinding trachoma, based on the clinical signs that are seen as the disease progresses.' Trachomatous inflammation -- follicular (TF): The first sign is the presence of follicles, which are small bumps formed by swollen lymph tissue on the back of the upper eyelid and sometimes extending to the top part of the eye. The presence of five or more follicles greater than 0.5 mm in size on the conjunctiva lining the back of the upper eyelid is considered grade TF. Trachomatous inflammation -- intense (TI): The next phase is swelling (inflammation) of the conjunctiva that obscures the view of the normal deeper blood vessels of the conjunctiva. Trachomatous scarring (TS): Bands of scar tissue form within the conjunctiva lining the inside of the upper eyelid. Trachomatous trichiasis (TT): The bands of scar tissue tighten, causing the lid margins to turn inward (entropion) and the eyelashes to rub against the eye (trichiasis). Over time, this rubbing results in abrasions of the cornea, the clear central covering of the front of the eye. Corneal opacity: Corneal abrasions can lead to infectious ulcers and ultimately opaque scarring that blocks light from entering the eye, leading to blindness."
What is the cause of trachoma?,"'The bacteria responsible for trachoma is ''Chlamydia trachomatis''. There are different types of ''Chlamydia'' trachomatis''. Types A, B, Ba, and C cause blinding trachoma. Other types (D to K) are associated with sexually transmitted ''chlamydia'' infection.''Living conditions with poor sanitation, unclean water supply, and lack of regular face washing allow the bacteria to infect and re-infect eyes of individuals living in trachoma-endemic areas.''The active form is most common in young children who spread it to those closest to them such as siblings, playmates, and caregivers. Among adults, women who care for children have a higher incidence of active disease.' "
What are trachoma symptoms and signs?,"'The symptoms include irritation of the eyes with tearing, ''pain'', ''light sensitivity'', and ''vision loss''. The signs include the presence of follicles, redness, scarring, and corneal opacity as described in the five stages listed above.' "
How do doctors diagnose trachoma?,"'Although there are tests to identify the bacteria, doctors primarily diagnose trachoma by examining the eyes and eyelids of the patient. Health care workers are trained in basic eye health examination techniques and can make the diagnosis by identifying the five stages of blinding trachoma with the aid of a light and simple magnifiers.' "
What is the treatment for trachoma? Is it possible to prevent trachoma?,"'The World Health Organization reported that the number of people at risk for trachoma has fallen from 1.5 billion in 2002 to just over 142 million in 2019.''The WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020 (GET2020) aims to completely eradicate the disease through implementation of the multifaceted SAFE strategy to prevent and treat trachoma:''The antibiotic treatment for active disease is a onetime use of ''azithromycin'' (''Zithromax'"") pills. However, reinfection is common if a person doesn't make improvements in hygiene and access to clean water.""'When trachoma has progressed to inward-turning of the lashes, surgery is necessary to correct the lid position.''If significant corneal scarring develops, corneal transplantation surgery is required to restore sight.''Various government agencies and international nongovernmental development organizations (INGDOs), such as the Carter Center Trachoma Control Program, work together to implement the SAFE strategy.'  S = surgery to correct in-turned eyelids and trichiasis A = antibiotics (azithromycin) to treat active infection F = facial cleanliness to reduce human transmission E = environmental improvement (such as access to clean water and hygiene measures to reduce the fly population) to reduce human transmission"
How long does trachoma last?,"'Some individuals who have trachoma infection of the eyes will have it only once and scarring will not necessarily occur. However, reinfections are common, and over many years, the untreated disease can progress through the five stages to blindness.' "
What is the prognosis for trachoma?,"'Community-based implementation of the SAFE strategy improved the prognosis for millions of at-risk individuals. If a doctor diagnoses trachoma and treats it early, before scarring of the eyelids and ''cornea'', the prognosis for preservation of vision is excellent.' "
What is prenatal ultrasound?,"'Like other ''ultrasound'' examinations, ''prenatal'' or fetal ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to obtain images of the fetus, placenta, and amniotic sac in a ''pregnant'' woman. The test does not involve ''radiation'' and is completely safe for both mother and baby. An ultrasound examination is also known as a ''sonogram''. The entire procedure can be performed in 30 minutes or less.\xa0Two types of ultrasound exams are used in ''pregnancy''.''Two types of ultrasound exams are used in pregnancy. The most common is a transabdominal ultrasound, in which the measuring instrument (transducer) is moved over the surface of the abdomen after a gel has been applied. Sometimes a full bladder is required to obtain better images, so you may be asked to drink several glasses of water before the test. There is no ''pain'"" or discomfort associated with the test, and it can be performed in the doctor's office.""""Transvaginal ultrasound uses a probe that is inserted directly into the vagina. It is performed in the doctor's office similar to a pelvic examination. This type of exam is most commonly used in the early weeks of pregnancy to rule out suspected problems or to assess the gestational age of the embryo. In early pregnancy this examination can provide more accurate information then a transabdominal examination.""  Transabdominal ultrasound Transvaginal ultrasound"
Why is prenatal ultrasound performed?,"'As mentioned above, transvaginal ultrasound is most often used in the early weeks of pregnancy to rule out problems or to determine how far along you are in the pregnancy. Most pregnant women receive a transabdominal ultrasound around the 20th week of pregnancy. This exam confirms that the baby is growing normally and that the placenta is attached normally. The heartbeat of the fetus is visible, and the movement of the fetus can be observed. Major ''birth defects'' can be visualized by this method, as well. In most cases, it is possible to determine the sex of the baby through an ultrasound exam at 20 weeks, but this method is not 100% accurate. You can tell the examiner whether or not you wish to know the gender of your baby at the time of the examination.''Ultrasound may also be performed earlier or later in the pregnancy for specific reasons that include:' Determination of multiple gestation Ensuring the health of the baby and 
monitoring its growth Determining the location of the 
placenta Estimation of gestational age and due 
date Assessing the expected size and weight 
of the baby Determining the amount of amniotic 
fluid Determining the position of the baby"
What are 3D and 4D ultrasound?,"'A 3D ultrasound provides a particularly clear image that resembles a photograph. A so-called 4D ultrasound provides this image in real time. Sometimes these ultrasound images are offered by non-medical providers in stores or other locations. Medical authorities, including The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Food and Drug Administration do not recommend using these services because the examiners may not have received proper training and could provide inaccurate information.' "
Are there risks associated with prenatal ultrasound?,"'As mentioned before, there is no radiation exposure during a prenatal ultrasound. Ultrasound exams have been used for many years, and studies have never shown any harms associated with the procedure, either on a short- or long-term basis.' "
What is transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM)?,"'Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM)'' is an advanced surgical procedure performed through the anus to remove polyps and early ''cancers'' of the rectum (end of the ''large intestine'' or anal area) using specially designed microsurgical instruments through the anus.\xa0''This technique avoids a major abdominal operation. The recovery time is greatly reduced for this procedure. In very rare cases, patients might require an artificial opening called ''stoma'', which is usually closed after the anal area is healed.''This procedure is usually performed under general anesthesia. TEM is performed through the patient’s anus. The surgeon precisely removes the polyp or small cancers, leaving the surrounding healthy tissue intact. In most cases, the healthy edges of the rectal lining are stitched together using dissolvable ''sutures''. These are either absorbed or expelled from the body naturally.\xa0''After the surgery, patients may need to stay in the hospital for one or two days. Most patients feel some discomfort, though rarely ''pain'', in the back passage.\xa0''After two days, patients may start on a ''liquid diet'' and gradually introduce solid foods. It is usually recommended that patients move around as soon as possible following the surgery. Patients may pass liquid stools for a few days.\xa0''Sometimes, it takes several weeks to get back to normal; in some cases, patients may have to adjust their diets.' "
What are the complications of transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM)?,"'Serious complications after transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) are rare.' Patients may have fever, pain and bleeding for a few days. They may be on intravenous liquids along with painkillers. Infection at the site of sutures. Patient are usually on antibiotics to prevent infection Intestine perforation Problems with artificial opening."
What is transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS)?,"'Transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) is a hybrid version of the transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM).' The surgeon usually uses standard laparoscopic instruments to remove a polyp or superficial lesion through the anus, without making an incision. The procedure is usually performed under general anesthesia. During TAMIS, the surgeon places a specialized laparoscopic surgery port into the anus. They pass the laparoscope and other needed instruments through the port to the rectum, where they remove the polyp. Once the lesion is removed, the surgeon sutures the hole in the rectum. This procedure allows surgeons to remove polyps that are too large or too flat to be removed through the other procedure.  The biggest drawback of TAMIS is that the lymph nodes cannot be assessed for cancer spread, so the procedure is only used for patients with very early-stage rectal cancer. Recovery is significantly better after TAMIS than that after other procedures."
Which procedure is considered for removing polyps and early cancers of the rectum?,"'Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) and transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) work on similar methods and principles. TAMIS is a safe and effective procedure for treating rectal cancers and can be performed without impairing anorectal functions. The major drawback of TEM is that it requires expensive, highly specialized equipment.\xa0''However, TAMIS offers several benefits over TEM because it requires minimal setup time, and the use of existing laparoscopic cameras and instruments offers a lower cost. Hence, TAMIS is usually considered to remove polyps or early cancers of the rectum.' "
What is aortic stenosis?,"'Sometimes, malfunction of the ''heart'' valves can lead to issues with blood flow and threaten the overall health of an individual.\xa0''Stenosis, more specifically ''aortic stenosis'' (AS), is narrowing of the ''aortic valve'' (one of the important heart valves) opening. It can be caused by age, genetic predisposition, ''radiation'' and/or buildup on the leaflets of calcium, ''cholesterol'' (fat), etc.\xa0'""This results in stiff valve leaflets that don't move easily or open fully. This reduces the pumping ability of the heart to push blood through the aortic valve to the body. Regurgitation happens when the valve has become damaged or worn out and the blood leaks backward. AS can sometimes lead to ""'heart failure'' or even sudden death.''Patients with AS exhibit the following symptoms:\xa0' Shortness of breath    Dizziness or fainting Chest pain Feeling tired or fatigued Swelling in the legs"
What is transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)?,"'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), also called transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), is a surgical procedure to artificially replace a narrowed heart valve called the aortic valve (which fails to open properly due to aortic valve stenosis). TAVR is a minimally invasive procedure that repairs the narrowed aortic valve without major surgery.\xa0''This procedure does not require stopping the heart or opening the chest ''cavity'"". The artificial valves are constructed from a combination of a metal mesh and animal tissue. Artificial valves are delivered via a thin wire (catheter) and expanded in place over the existing valve. Once in place, the valve immediately begins functioning. TAVR can improve survival in people who can't undergo major surgery."" "
What happens during a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedure?,"'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is usually done under general anesthesia. The patient is also given intravenous medication to prevent ''blood clots'', and their condition is monitored throughout the procedure.\xa0' The doctor may access the patient’s heart through a blood vessel in the leg or through a tiny incision in the chest. The doctor may sometimes use other approaches to access the heart.  A catheter (hollow tube) is inserted through the access point. The doctor uses advanced imaging techniques to guide the catheter through the blood vessels, to the heart and into the aortic valve. Once the new valve is positioned, a balloon on the catheter’s tip is inflated to expand the replacement valve into the appropriate position. Some valves can expand without the use of a balloon. When the doctor is certain that the valve is securely in place, the catheter is removed. The opening is sealed with stitches, and the patient may be monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU)."
What are the risks involved in a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedure?,"'All medical procedures come with some type of risk. The risks of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may include the following:' Bleeding Blood vessel complications Problems with the replacement valve such as the valve slipping out of place or leaking Stroke Arrhythmias (heart rhythm problems) and the need for pacemaker placement Kidney disease Heart attack Infection Death Anesthesia complications such as headache, drowsiness, and sometimes vomiting"
How much time will it take to recover after the TAVR procedure?,"'Usually, patients are discharged within two days after the procedure. Patients may be on painkillers, antibiotics, and anti-''blood clot'' medications for a week or 10 days. Patients can enroll in a cardiac rehabilitation program after 10 days. Patients recover within a month after the procedure. Research shows the procedure has improved health and quality of life within 30 days after the procedure.' "
Electrical nerve stimulation history,"'For several thousand years, people have recognized that electrical stimulation can have an impact on ''pain''. Hippocrates, the father of medicine, is said to have used electric fish to cause numbness, and a report of ''gout'' being “cured” by accidental contact with a fish called an electric ray dates back to the first century. Later reports also described ''pain'' resolution that occurred when similar types of “electric” fish were placed on afflicted body parts.'""It wasn't until the 18th century when a more formal device to deliver electricity to decrease pain was created. Although initially developed in Europe, Benjamin Franklin is credited with reforming the original electric condenser, which was used to ""'shock'' patients in an effort to treat various ailments.\xa0' "
What is a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit?,"'Today, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation units, or TENS units, are commonly used to treat many types of pain, including chronic back and ''neck pain''. Unlike the early devices, where the amount of electricity delivered might vary, TENS units supply a controlled electrical current to stimulate nerve endings through surface electrodes, which are placed over the affected region.'  "
How does transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation work?,"'The rationale for using a TENS unit for pain control is based on the inability of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves to multi-task -- that is, impulses that are being carried along a pathway within the nervous system effectively block that pathway from transmitting other signals. In essence, flooding a pathway with low-level stimulation keeps pain signals from reaching the brain.''TENS units are reported to work rapidly, although it can take some adjustment to find the correct level of stimulation. Additionally, TENS units are portable, which can improve the mobility of a patient experiencing ''chronic pain''. However, not all types of pain respond to this method of treatment and any effect tends to be short-lived; pain quickly recurs once the stimulator is removed.' "
Who is a good candidate for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation?,"""Although this therapy isn't for everyone, individuals looking for a relatively inexpensive, well-tolerated treatment option with few side effects may find a TENS unit a good option to explore.""  "
What is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation?,"'Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation'' (TENS) is a therapy that provides short-term ''pain'' relief using low-voltage electric current. It is noninvasive, inexpensive and can even be self-administered. It is one of the most popular forms of electric therapy for ''pain'' relief.' "
How does transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation work?,"'The TENS device delivers electrical impulses through the skin to the nerves. This reduces the ability of the nerves to send pain signals from an injured area to the brain, relaxes the muscles, and provides temporary pain relief.' "
What are the types of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation?,"'There are three methods by which TENS maybe applied:''Conventional TENS is the most commonly used method. The pain relief is almost immediate, but for a short duration. Some patients may not tolerate the higher intensities. These levels are only for those who do not respond to conventional TENS.' Conventional TENS – high frequency/low intensity stimulation Acupuncture-like TENS – low frequency/high intensity Pulsed or intense TENS – the nerve stimulation comes in short bursts"
How is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation performed?,"'A patient undergoing TENS needs no preparation before the procedure. It can be done at an outpatient facility or at home by the patients themselves.''The TENS sessions can be as long and as often as needed depending upon the method used.' The TENS unit is a small battery-operated device that delivers low voltage electric pulses. It has electrodes with sticky pads, which are placed on the patient’s skin over the affected area. The stimulation settings can be adjusted to give effective pain relief without discomfort."
What conditions does transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation treat?,"'TENS is useful for ''chronic pain'' relief in patients with the following:''Musculoskeletal pain'' from conditions like''TENS has been used to relieve pain in patients with certain forms of ''chest pain'', and for ''incontinence''. There are reports of its use in assisting ''stroke'' patients to regain motor functions and to control ''nausea'' in patients undergoing ''chemotherapy''.' Nerve pain or neuralgia such as postherpetic neuralgia trigeminal neuralgia pain from pinched nerve or radiculopathy complex regional pain syndrome phantom pain rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis bursitis tendinitis Menstrual pain Diabetic neuropathy from nerve damage due to diabetes Post-surgery pain Posttraumatic pain Chronic headaches"
What are the side effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation?,"'TENS has few or no side effects on most people. In some patients it may cause a few side effects:''Skin reactions can often be avoided by keeping the gel pads sanitized and following good ''skin care''. The other reactions are uncommon and can generally be relieved with ''over-the-counter'' medicines.''TENS should be used with caution on patients with skin ''allergies'' or diseases. It should not be used on a patient who' Skin reactions where the electrodes are attached including burning or irritation allergic reaction contact dermatitis Nausea and dizziness Muscle spasms Headache has a pacemaker or other heart problems, is pregnant, or has epilepsy."
Is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation safe?,"'TENS is, in general, safe for most people. The electric impulses might cause a prickling sensation that might be uncomfortable for some. Some may be ''allergic'' to the electrode pads.' "
Can a TENS unit cause nerve damage?,"'TENS unit is not known to cause any nerve damage. A backfire in the TENS unit might provoke an overreaction in the nerve causing some pain or discomfort, but the nerve itself is unlikely to be damaged. There is no conclusive evidence, but some research suggests chronic electrical stimulation might damage the nerve structure and disturb its function.' "
Is TENS effective for pain?,"'Overall TENS is effective for pain relief, which may be instant and prolonged. In some, it may take several sessions to see results. It should also be noted that TENS offers only short-term pain relief and is not a cure for pain.''Clinical experience shows that TENS is effective for most ''chronic pain'"" and some acute pain. The efficacy of TENS appears to be variable depending on the individuals and the kind of conditions treated. Though many patients experience relief with TENS, no clear scientific evidence shows that it's as reliable a method of pain reduction as painkilling ""'drugs''. Research is ongoing.' "
What Is Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'Sometimes brain ''seizures'' begin in a vital area of the brain -- for example, in areas that control movement, feeling, language, or memory. When this is the case, a relatively new ''epilepsy treatment'' called multiple subpial transection (MST) may be an option. MST stops the ''seizure'' impulses by cutting nerve fibers in the outer layers of the brain (''gray matter''), sparing the vital functions concentrated in the deeper layers of brain tissue (white matter).' "
Who Is a Candidate for Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'Most people with ''epilepsy'' can control their ''seizures'' with medication. However, about 20% of people with ''epilepsy'' do not improve with ''drugs''. In some cases, surgery to remove the part of the brain causing the seizures may be recommended.''MST may be an option for people who do not respond to medication and whose seizures begin in areas of the brain that cannot be safely removed. In addition, there must be a reasonable chance that the person will benefit from surgery. MST may be done alone or with the removal of a section of brain tissue (resection). MST also may be used as a treatment for children with ''Landau-Kleffner syndrome'' (LKS), a rare childhood brain disorder which causes seizures and affects the parts of the brain that control speech and comprehension.' "
What Happens Before Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'Candidates for MST undergo an extensive pre-surgery evaluation -- including ''seizure'' monitoring, electroencephalography (''EEG''), ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI''), and positron emission tomography (PET). These tests help to pinpoint the area in the brain where the seizures occur and determine if surgery is feasible.'""Another test to assess electrical activity in the brain is EEG-video monitoring, in which video cameras are used to record seizures as they occur, while the EEG monitors the brain's activity. In some cases, invasive monitoring -- in which electrodes are placed inside the skull over a specific area of the brain -- is also used to further identify the tissue responsible for seizures."" "
What Happens During Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'MST requires exposing an area of the brain using a procedure called a craniotomy. (""Crani"" refers to the skull and ""otomy"" means ""to cut into."") After the patient is put to ''sleep'' with anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision (cut) in the ''scalp'', removes a piece of bone and pulls back a section of the dura, the tough membrane that covers the brain. This creates a ""window"" in which the surgeon inserts his or her surgical instruments. The surgeon utilizes information gathered during pre-surgical brain imaging to help identify the area of abnormal brain tissue and avoid areas of the brain responsible for vital functions.''Using a surgical microscope to produce a magnified view of the brain, the surgeon makes a series of parallel, shallow ''cuts'' (transections) in gray matter, just below the pia mater (subpial), the delicate membrane that surrounds the brain (it lies beneath the dura). The cuts are made over the entire area identified as the source of the seizures. After the transactions are made, the dura and bone are fixed back into place, and the scalp is closed using ''stitches'' or staples.' "
What Happens After Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'After MST, the patient generally stays in an intensive care unit for 24 to 48 hours and in a regular hospital room for three to four days. Most people who have MST will be able to return to their normal activities, including work or school, in six to eight weeks after surgery. Most patients will continue to take anti-seizure medication. Once seizure control is established, medications may be reduced or eliminated.' "
How Effective Is Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'MST results in satisfactory improvement in seizure control in about 70% of patients, although the procedure is still relatively new, and no long-term outcome data are available. Children with LKS or other forms of ''epilepsy'' not controlled by medication may have improved intellectual and psychosocial functioning following MST.' "
What Are the Side Effects of Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'The following side effects may occur after MST, although they generally go away on their own over several weeks:' Scalp numbness. Nausea. Feeling tired or depressed. Headaches. Difficulty speaking, remembering, or finding words."
What Risks Are Associated With Multiple Subpial Transection?,"'The risks associated with MST include:''WebMD Medical Reference' Risks associated with surgery, including infection, bleeding, and an allergic reaction to anesthesia. Failure to relieve seizures. Swelling in the brain. Damage to healthy brain tissue."
What is a blood transfusion?,"""A blood transfusion is the transfer of blood or blood products from one person (donor) into another person's bloodstream (recipient). This is usually done as a lifesaving maneuver to replace blood cells or blood products lost through severe bleeding, during surgery when blood loss occurs or to increase the blood count in an ""'anemic'' patient. The following material is provided to all patients and/or their family members regarding blood transfusions and the use of blood products. Although in most situations the likelihood of a blood transfusion associated with surgery is uncommon, at times patients may require blood products. You are encouraged to discuss your particular need for transfusion as well as the risks of transfusion with your doctor.''Your options may be limited by time and health factors, so it is important to begin carrying out your decision as soon as possible. For example, if friends or family members are donating blood for a patient (directed donors); their blood should be drawn several days prior to the anticipated need to allow adequate time for testing and labeling. The exact protocols are hospital and donor site specific.'""The safest blood product is your own, so if a transfusion is likely, this is your lowest risk choice. Unfortunately, this option is usually only practical when preparing for elective surgery. In most other instances, the person cannot donate their own blood due to the acute nature of the need for blood. Although you have the right to refuse a blood transfusion, this decision may have life-threatening consequences. If you are a parent deciding for your child, you as the parent or guardian must understand that in a life-threatening situation your doctors will act in your child's best interest to insure your child's health and wellbeing in accordance with standards of medical care regardless of religious beliefs. Please carefully review this material and decide with your doctor which option(s) you prefer, understanding that your doctor will always act in the best interest of his or her patient.""'To assure a safe transfusion make sure your healthcare provider who starts the transfusion verifies your name and matches it to the blood that is going to be transfused. Besides your name, a second personal identifier usually used is your birthday. This assures the blood is given to the correct patient.''If during the transfusion you have symptoms of ''shortness of breath'', ''itching'', ''fever'' or ''chills'' or just not feeling well, alert the person transfusing the blood immediately.''Blood can be provided from two sources: '' autologous blood'' (using your own blood) or '' donor blood'"" (using someone else's blood).""  "
Using your own blood (autologous blood)," Pre-operative donation: donating your own blood before surgery. The blood bank draws your blood and stores it until you need it during or after surgery. This option is only for non-emergency (elective) surgery. It has the advantage of eliminating or minimizing the need for someone else's blood during and after surgery. The disadvantage is that it requires advanced planning which may delay surgery. Some medical conditions may prevent the pre-operative donation of blood products. Intra-operative autologous transfusion: recycling your blood during surgery. Blood lost during surgery is filtered, and put back into your body during surgery. This can be done in emergency and elective surgeries. It has the advantage of eliminating or minimizing the need for someone else's blood during surgery. Large amounts of blood can be recycled. This process cannot be used if cancer or infection is present. Post-operative autologous transfusion: recycling your blood after surgery. Blood lost after surgery is collected, filtered and returned to your body. This can be done in emergency and elective surgeries. It has the advantage of eliminating or minimizing the need for someone else's blood during surgery. This process can't be used in patients where cancer or infection is present. Hemodilution: donating your own blood during surgery. Immediately before surgery, some of your blood is taken and replaced with IV fluids. After surgery, your blood is filtered and returned to you. This is done only for elective surgeries. This process dilutes your own blood so you lose less concentrated blood during surgery. It has the advantage of eliminating or minimizing the need for someone else's blood during surgery. The disadvantage of this process is that only a limited amount of blood can be removed, and certain medical conditions may prevent the use of this technique. Apheresis: donating your own platelets and plasma. Before surgery, your platelets and plasma, which help stop bleeding, are withdrawn, filtered, and returned to you when you need it later. This can be done only for elective surgeries. This process may eliminate the need for donor platelets and plasma, especially in high blood-loss procedures. The disadvantage of this process is that some medical conditions may prevent apheresis, however, it has limited applications."
Donor blood (blood from another person),"'All donor blood is tested for safety making its risks very small, but no screening program is perfect and risks, such as contraction of the ''hepatitis'' virus or other infectious diseases still exist.''Volunteer blood:'' blood collected from the community blood supply (blood banks). This has the advantage of being readily available and can be life-saving when your own blood is not available. The disadvantage is that there is a risk of disease transmission, such as ''hepatitis'', and ''allergic'' reactions.''Designated donor blood: ''blood is collected from the donors you select. You can select people with your own ''blood type'' who you feel are safe donors. Like volunteer blood, there is still a risk of disease transmission, such as hepatitis and ''AIDS'', and allergic reactions. This process usually requires several days for advanced donation. It may not necessarily be safer than volunteer donor blood.' "
What is a blood bank?,"'Blood banks collect, test, and store blood. They carefully screen all donated blood for possible infectious agents, such as ''viruses'', that could make you sick.'""Blood bank staff also screen each blood donation to find out whether it's ""'type A'"", B, AB, or O and whether it's Rh-positive or Rh-negative. Getting a blood type that doesn't work with your own blood type will make you very sick. That's why blood banks are very careful when they test the blood.""'To prepare blood for a transfusion, some blood banks remove white blood cells. This process is called white cell or leukocyte (LU-ko-site) reduction. Although rare, some people are allergic to white blood cells in donated blood. Removing these cells makes allergic reactions less likely.'""Not all transfusions use blood donated from a stranger. If you're going to have surgery, you may need a blood transfusion because of blood loss during the operation. If it's surgery that you're able to schedule months in advance, your doctor may ask whether you would like to use your own blood, rather than donated blood.""'If you choose to use your own blood, you will need to have blood drawn one or more times prior to the surgery. A blood bank will store your blood for your use.' "
What are the different types of blood?,"'Almost all cells, including red blood cells, have molecules on their surface that have important roles to play in interactions with cells of the immune system. There are multiple sites on each cell for the molecules, and at each site, one of several related molecules may reside. Each site has only a limited number of different molecules that can reside there; each site has its own, unique molecules. Each molecule that can reside at any one site is referred to (defined) as a blood type, and the entire group of related molecules that can occupy a single site is referred to as a blood group.''A blood group is an ''inherited'' feature. For example, two series of ''blood types'' constitute a blood group system known as the Rh or the ABO systems.'""Because blood types are responsible for the interactions between cells such as red blood cells and the immune system, it is important that the blood types of the donor and the recipient of red blood cells match. If the donor and recipient's blood types are not matched, the recipient's immune system will destroy the donor's cells.""'There are four blood types:'""Every person has one of the above four blood types. In addition, each person's blood is either:""""For example, if a person has type A blood, it's either type A positive or type A negative."" A, B, AB, or O. Rh-positive, or Rh-negative. Type O negative blood is safe for just about everyone. People with type O negative blood are referred to as universal donors; and type O negative blood is used for emergencies in which there is no time to test a person's blood type. Individuals who have type AB positive blood are referred to as universal recipients. This means that they can receive any type of blood. People who have Rh-positive blood can receive Rh-positive or Rh-negative blood. If a person has Rh-negative blood, they should only receive Rh-negative blood. Rh-negative blood is used for emergencies when there is not time to test a person's Rh type."
What are the types of blood transfusions?,"'Blood is transfused either as whole blood (with all its parts) or, more frequently as individual parts. The type of blood transfusion you need depends on your situation.''Red blood cells are the most commonly transfused components of the blood. These cells carry oxygen from the ''lungs'"" to your body's organs and tissues. They also help your body get rid of carbon dioxide and other waste products.""""You may need a transfusion of red blood cells if you've lost blood due to an injury or surgery. You also may need this type of transfusion if you have severe ""'anemia'' (uh-NEE-me-uh) due to disease or blood loss.''Anemia'"" is a condition in which your blood has a lower than a normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don't have enough ""'hemoglobin'' (HEE-muh-glow-bin).''Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color. This protein carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.''Platelets and clotting factors help stop bleeding, including ''internal bleeding'"" that you can't see. Some illnesses may cause your body to not make enough platelets or clotting factors. You may need regular transfusions of these blood products to stay healthy.""'For example, if you have ''hemophilia'"" (heem-o-FILL-ee-ah), you may need a special clotting factor to replace the clotting factor you're lacking. ""'Hemophilia'' is a rare, inherited ''bleeding disorder'"" in which your blood doesn't clot normally.""'If you have ''hemophilia'', you may bleed for a longer time than others may after an injury or accident. You also may bleed internally, especially in the joints (knees, ankles, and elbows).'""Plasma is the liquid part of your blood. It's mainly water, but also contains proteins, clotting factors, hormones, ""'vitamins'', ''cholesterol'', ''sugar'', sodium, potassium, calcium, and more.''If you have been badly burned or have ''liver'' failure or a severe infection, you may need a plasma transfusion.'  "
Who needs a blood transfusion?,"'Blood transfusions are very common. Each year, almost 5 million Americans need blood transfusions. This procedure is used for people of all ages.''Many people who have surgery need blood transfusions because they lose blood during their operations. For example, about one-third of all ''heart'' surgery patients have a transfusion.''Some people who have serious injuries - such as from car crashes, war, or natural disasters - need blood transfusions to replace blood lost during the injury.''Some people need blood or parts of blood because of illnesses. You may need a blood transfusion if you have:' A severe infection or liver disease that stops your body from properly making blood or some parts of blood. An illness that causes anemia, such as kidney disease or cancer. Medicines or radiation used to treat a medical condition also can cause anemia. There are many types of anemia, including aplastic, Fanconi, hemolytic, iron-deficiency, pernicious, and sickle cell anemias and thalassemia (thal-a-SE-me-a). A bleeding disorder, such as hemophilia or thrombocytopenia (THROM-bo-si-to-PE-ne-ah)."
What to expect before a blood transfusion,"'Before a blood transfusion, a technician tests your blood to find out what blood type you have (that is, A, B, AB, or O and Rh-positive or Rh-negative). He or she pricks your finger with a needle to get a few drops of blood or draws blood from one of your veins.'""The blood type used in your transfusion must work with your blood type. If it doesn't, antibodies (proteins) in your blood attack the new blood and make you sick.""'Some people have allergic reactions even when the blood given does work with their own blood type. To prevent this, your doctor may prescribe a medicine to stop allergic reactions.''If you have ''allergies'' or have had an ''allergic reaction'"" during a past transfusion, your doctor will make every effort to make sure you're safe.""""Most people don't need to change their diets or activities before or after a blood transfusion. Your doctor will let you know whether you need to make any lifestyle changes prior to the procedure."" "
What to expect during a blood transfusion,"""Blood transfusions take place in either a doctor's office or a hospital. Sometimes they're done at a person's home, but this is less common. Blood transfusions also are done during surgery and in emergency rooms.""'A needle is used to insert an intravenous (IV) line into one of your blood vessels. Through this line, you receive healthy blood. The procedure usually takes 1 to 4 hours. The time depends on how much blood you need and what part of the blood you receive.''During the blood transfusion, a nurse carefully watches you, especially for the first 15 minutes. This is when allergic reactions are most likely to occur. The nurse continues to watch you during the rest of the procedure as well.' "
What to expect after a blood transfusion,"'After a blood transfusion, your vital signs are checked (such as your temperature, ''blood pressure'', and heart rate). The intravenous (IV) line is taken out. You may have some ''bruising'' or soreness for a few days at the site where the IV was inserted.''You may need blood tests that show how your body is reacting to the transfusion. Your doctor will let you know about signs and symptoms to watch for and report.' "
"Allergic reactions, infections, fever, and iron overload risks and complications","'Most blood transfusions go very smoothly. However, mild problems and, very rarely, serious problems can occur.''Some people have allergic reactions to the blood given during transfusions. This can happen even when the blood given is the right blood type.''Allergic reactions can be mild or severe. Symptoms can include:''A nurse or doctor will stop the transfusion at the first signs of an allergic reaction. The health care team determines how mild or severe the reaction is, what treatments are needed, and whether the transfusion can safely be restarted.''Some infectious agents, such as ''HIV'', can survive in blood and infect the person receiving the blood transfusion. To keep blood safe, blood banks carefully screen donated blood.''The risk of catching a virus from a blood transfusion is very low.'""You may get a sudden fever during or within a day of your blood transfusion. This is usually your body's normal response to white blood cells in the donated blood. ""'Over-the-counter'' fever medicine usually will treat the fever.''Some blood banks remove white blood cells from whole blood or different parts of the blood. This makes it less likely that you will have a reaction after the transfusion.''Getting many blood transfusions can cause too much iron to build up in your blood (''iron overload''). People who have a blood disorder like thalassemia, which requires multiple transfusions, are at risk for ''iron overload''. Iron overload can damage your liver, heart, and other parts of your body.''If you have iron overload (''hemochromatosis''), you may need iron chelation (ke-LAY-shun) therapy. For this therapy, medicine is given through an injection or as a pill to remove the extra iron from your body.'   Anxiety Chest and/or back pain Trouble breathing Fever, chills, flushing, and clammy skin A quick pulse or low blood pressure Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) HIV. Your risk of getting HIV from a blood transfusion is lower than your risk of being killed by lightning. Only about 1 in 2 million donations might carry HIV and transmit HIV if given to a patient. Hepatitis B and C. The risk of having a donation that carries hepatitis B is about 1 in 205,000. The risk for hepatitis C is 1 in 2 million. If you receive blood during a transfusion that contains hepatitis, you'll likely develop the virus. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). This disease is the human version of Mad Cow Disease. It's a very rare, yet fatal brain disorder. There is a possible risk of getting vCJD from a blood transfusion, although the risk is very low. Because of this, people who may have been exposed to vCJD aren't eligible blood donors."
"Lung injuries, hemolytic reactions, and immune hemolytic reaction risks and complications","""Although it's unlikely, blood transfusions can damage your lungs, making it hard to breathe. This usually occurs within about 6 hours of the procedure. Most people recover, however, 5% to 25% of people who develop lung injuries die from the injuries. These people usually were very ill before the transfusion.""""Doctors aren't completely sure why blood transfusions damage the lungs. Antibodies (proteins) that are more likely to be found in the plasma of women who have been ""'pregnant'"" may disrupt the normal way that lung cells work. Because of this risk, hospitals are starting to use men's and women's plasma differently.""""Acute immune hemolytic reaction is very serious, but also very rare. It occurs if the blood type you get during a transfusion doesn't match or work with your blood type. Your body attacks the new red blood cells, which then produce substances that harm your kidneys.""'The immune hemolytic reaction symptoms include:''The doctor will stop the transfusion at the first sign of this reaction.''This is a much slower version of acute immune hemolytic reaction. Your body destroys red blood cells so slowly that the problem can go unnoticed until your red blood cell level is very low.''Both acute and delayed hemolytic reactions are most common in patients who have had a previous transfusion.''Graft-versus-host disease'' (''GVHD'') is a condition in which white blood cells in the new blood attack your tissues. ''GVHD'' usually is fatal. People who have weakened immune systems are the most likely to get GVHD.''Symptoms start within a month of the blood transfusion. They include fever, ''rash'', and ''diarrhea'"". To protect against GVHD, people who have weakened immune systems should receive blood that has been treated so the white blood cells can't cause GVHD."" Chills Fever Nausea Chest or back pain Dark urine"
Are there alternatives to blood transfusions?,"""Researchers are trying to find ways to make blood. There's currently no manufactured alternative to human blood. However, researchers have developed medicines that may help do the job of some blood parts.""'For example, some people who have kidney problems can now take a medicine called ''erythropoietin'' that helps their bodies make more red blood cells. This means they may need fewer blood transfusions.''Surgeons try to reduce the amount of blood lost during surgery so that fewer patients need blood transfusions. Sometimes they can collect and reuse the blood for the patient.' "
What is a transient ischemic attack (TIA)?,"'The primary role of the brain is to send signals to the body for motor function and respond to receive signals received through the five senses (sight, ''hearing'', touch, smell, and taste). The brain processes information both through conscious thought, and unconsciously through the nervous systems that control basic bodily functions, like heart rate, ''breathing'', and temperature control.''When a portion of the brain loses its blood supply, it can become damaged and stop functioning. When a portion of the brain does not function, the part of the body that it controls also stops working. This is called a stroke or a ''cerebrovascular accident'' (CVA). If the brain is able to regain its blood supply quickly, then the CVA symptoms may resolve; this is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA is a stroke that resolves by itself. ' The brain is arranged so that the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body, and the left side of the brain controls the right of the body. Vision is located in the back of the brain (occiput), and balance and coordination are located at the bottom of the brain (cerebellum). Blood supply to the brain comes from the two carotid arteries that are located in the front of the neck, and the 
two vertebral arteries that run in the back of the neck through small canals in the bony spine (vertebrae).  All four arteries connect at a junction of blood vessels located in the base of the brain (called the Circle of Willis), and from there smaller arteries 
branch out to supply the brain with oxygen and nutrients."
"What are the 
causes of transient ischemic attack (TIA)?","'Loss of blood supply to portions of the brain may occur for a variety of reasons. A blood vessel can become blocked, and blood supply to a part of the brain is lost, or a blood vessel can leak blood into the brain (''brain hemorrhage''). Most commonly however, the blood vessel is blocked. The blockage can be caused by a ''blood clot'' that forms in the blood vessel (thrombosis) or it can be caused by a clot or debris that floats downstream (embolus).''Fatty plaque formation in the blood vessel wall is called atherosclerosis or ""hardening of the arteries."" Plaque can rupture and cause a small ''blood clot'' to form and occlude the blood vessel. Blockage can also occur when debris from narrowing of a carotid artery breaks off, and floats downstream to cause the occlusion. Sometimes, in people with an irregular heart beat called ''atrial fibrillation'', small blood clots can be formed within the heart and travel to the brain to cause the obstruction.''Brain hemorrhage or bleeding in the brain can be due to an ''aneurysm'', a weak spot in a blood vessel that ruptures and spills blood into the brain tissue, or it may be due to spontaneous bleeding caused by poorly controlled ''hypertension'' (''high blood pressure''). Such bleeding more commonly results in the irreversible damage of a stroke, and would not necessarily resolve to be classified as a TIA.'  "
What are the risk factors for transient ischemic attack (TIA)?,"'The risk factors for TIA or stroke are the same as those for other ''vascular disease'', similar to heart attack (''coronary artery disease'') or ''peripheral vascular disease'', which causes decreased blood flow to the legs. These risk factors include:''Moreover, any condition that results in stagnant blood flow and or clotting may result in a TIA due to embolization of a blood clot. Such conditions may include ''atrial fibrillation'', large ''heart attacks'', and severe ''weakness'' of the heart muscle (''cardiomyopathy'') .' family history smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes."
"What are the 
symptoms of transient ischemic attack (TIA)?","'The intensity and location of the blood limitation to the brain will determine what symptoms will occur as a result of a stroke or TIA. Many people experience ''confusion'', weakness, and lethargy. If the loss of blood supply is in an area supplied by the middle cerebral artery, a classic sign may include weakness or ''paralysis'' and numbness of one side of the body. The whole side may be affected, or just one limb. Often there is a facial droop. If the stroke is on the left side of the body where the speech centers are usually located, there may be difficulty understanding words or speaking. Partial ''vision loss'' may also be part of the constellation of symptoms.''Strokes'' involving the vertebral arteries decrease blood supply to the base of the brain and may cause a drop attack (a sudden fall while ''walking'' or standing, and then a quick recovery), an unexpected collapse, incoordination, or difficulty walking.''The important distinction between stroke and TIA is resolution of the symptoms. By definition, the symptoms of a TIA must completely resolve. And, while this most often occurs within the first few minutes after symptom onset, it may take up to 24 hours to have complete return to normal function.''A special type of TIA is amaurosis fugax. Transient ''blindness'' in one eye occurs because debris from a narrowed carotid artery clogs the artery (ophthalmic artery) that supplies blood to the retina of the eye.'  "
How is transient ischemic attack (TIA) diagnosed?,"'TIA is diagnosed by history and physical examination. Since most often the symptoms have resolved, the physician will need to complete a thorough history from the patient and family or friends who witnessed the event. The physical exam will include careful attention to the neurologic examination. This may include:''If the diagnosis of TIA is made, further urgent testing is usually recommended, including: '  Assess mental status to make certain the patient is alert and oriented. Check eye range of motion and facial movement to evaluate the cranial nerves (the short nerves that run from the brain to the face and neck). Listen to the neck with a stethoscope to detect abnormal sounds that may signal narrowing of the blood vessel (carotid bruits). Check for a regular heart rhythm to rule out the presence of atrial fibrillation. Examine the arms and legs for tone, power, and sensation. Check coordination and balance. Electrocardiogram (EKG) to confirm a regular heart rate Computerized tomography (CT scan) of the brain to assess bleeding Carotid ultrasound to assess for narrowing of the large blood vessels in the neck Some hospitals have CT angiogram available to evaluate the cerebral, carotid, and vertebral arteries. This test is the same as a CT of the head with the addition of intravenous dye into the blood vessels to the arteries. Routine blood tests may include a complete blood count (CBC) to assess for anemia 
(low red blood cell count) or too few platelets (thrombocytopenia). If the patient takes warfarin (Coumadin), a blood thinner, then an international normalized ratio (INR - a blood test that measures the degree of blood thinning) or prothrombin time (PT), may be performed to assess blood clotting measurements. If there is concern that the heart is the source of blood clot or debris, then an echocardiogram or sound wave tracing of the heart may be considered."
What is the treatment for a transient ischemic attack (TIA)?,"'Treatment for a transient ischemic attack is aimed at preventing a second stroke. Since there is no way of determining the severity of future episodes, and no guarantee that the symptoms will resolve, ''prevention'' of a future TIA or CVA is crucial. ''Treatment guidelines address a variety of targeted goals. ''Smoking'', excessive ''alcohol'', ''obesity'' and lack of physical activity are considered risks for future stroke. The following recommendations are now suggested: '  If the patient was not taking 
aspirin when the TIA occurred, it usually is started at a dose of 325 mg per day. If the patient was taking aspirin, another antiplatelet drug called dipyridamole may be added. Aggrenox is a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole. Headache is often a side effect. If the patient cannot tolerate aspirin because of allergy or stomach upset clopidogrel (Plavix) may be used.  Even if the patient does not have hypertension or high blood pressure, there may be benefit in taking anti-hypertensive medications. Two classes of drugs are recommended to be started at the same time, a diuretic and an 
ACE inhibitor. The goal for normal blood pressure is 120/80.  Guidelines recommend that a statin drug be started, even if cholesterol levels are normal. Simvastatin (Zocor) is the most commonly recommended medication, but new guidelines limit the amount prescribed per day because of the risk of liver side effects. Smoking: Counseling, smoking cessation aids like 
nicotine gum or medications like
varenicline (Chantix) should be considered. Environmental smoke should be avoided. Alcohol: Intake should be limited to two or fewer drinks a day for men and one or less for women. Obesity: Overweight people should try to lose weight using a combination of diet, exercise and counseling. The goal is a BMI of 18.5-24.9 and a waist line of 35 inches or less for women and 40 inches or less for men.  Exercise: 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily is recommended for those who are able. For 
people with disabilities, a tailored exercise program to their capabilities should be arranged. "
What is the prognosis for transient ischemic attack (TIA)?,"'A transient ischemic attack should be considered a major warning sign of an impending future stroke. Up to 15% of people will experience a stroke within three months of TIA. Since there is no way of predicting that stroke-like symptoms will resolve, the patient and family need to be educated should symptoms occur, they need to access medical care emergently'' activating the emergency medical services system and calling 911.''If a stroke occurs, there is a very short period of time where the thrombolytic (clot busting drugs like ''alteplase'' [TPA]), can be used to reverse a stroke. In most hospitals, the drug can only be given within 4 1/2 hours of onset of ''stroke symptoms''. In that time frame, the patient needs to get to the hospital, the diagnosis needs to be made, laboratory tests and head ''CT scans'"" need to be performed, neurologic consultation needs to occur, and the drug administered. The longer the delay, greater the risk that the drug won't work and that complications such as bleeding into the brain will occur.""'Specialized interventional radiologists can inject TPA directly into the clot that has blocked the blood vessel in the brain. This can extend the time frame to six hours or longer, but currently this treatment is not widely available.''TIAs should be considered the equivalent of ''angina'' of the brain. In ''heart disease'', angina is the heart ''pain'' that warns of potential heart attack. When heart muscle is damaged, it cannot be replaced or repaired. Similarly, brain tissue is at risk when there is decreased blood supply and it, too, cannot be replaced.'  "
What is TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt)?,'Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or (TIPS) is a shunt (tube) placed between the portal vein which carries blood from the ''intestines'' and intraabdominal organs to the ''liver'' and the hepatic vein which carries blood from the liver back to the vena cava and the ''heart''. '  
What is TIPS used for?,"'It is used primarily (but not exclusively) in patients with ''cirrhosis'' in which the ''scar tissue'' within the liver causes partial blockage of flow of blood passing through the liver from the portal vein to the hepatic vein. The blockage increases the pressure in the portal vein, which is called ''portal hypertension''. As a result of the increase in pressure, portal blood flows preferentially or shunts through the branches of the portal vein to veins coming from abdominal organs that normally drain toward the portal vein. These organs connect with veins that do not empty into the portal vein and thus bypass the liver. Thus, much of the flow of blood bypasses the liver. If these veins going to the other organs enlarge, they are referred to as variceal veins or varices. Unfortunately, one of the places varices form is in the stomach and lower ''esophagus'', and these varices have a tendency to bleed massively, frequently causing death from exsanguination. By providing an artificial path for blood traveling from the intestines, through, the liver, and back to the heart, the shunt placed during the TIPS procedure reduces the pressure in the portal vein, significantly decreasing the likelihood of varices bleeding.' "
How is TIPS performed?,"'There are several types of portosystemic shunts that are placed surgically, but TIPS is a non-surgical method of placing a portosystemic shunt. The shunt is passed down the jugular vein from the neck by a radiologist using X-ray guidance. The shunt then is inserted between the portal and hepatic veins within the liver.' "
What are the complications of TIPS?,"'There are two important complications of the TIPS procedure.  The first is ''hepatic encephalopathy'', a condition in which it is believed that toxic products from the intestines (for example, ammonia) that are normally removed from the blood by the liver remain in the blood and are delivered to the brain.  (The TIPS allows the toxin-containing blood to bypass the liver.)  The effects on the brain can vary from minor alterations in thinking to full ''coma''.''A second complication is ''heart failure'' due to the sudden increase in the amount of blood returning to the heart through the shunt.  The heart is unable to pump the returning blood fast enough, resulting in heart failure.''Finally, one complication may be caused by the shunt itself; problems such as infection and shunt occlusion, requiring placement of another shunt.'  "
What is a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)?,"'A ''transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt'' (TIPS) is an artificial connection that is created by a radiologist between two veins (hepatic vein and portal vein) in the ''liver''. These veins are connected by a small tube known as a ''stent''.''The TIPS procedure is performed in patients who have increased pressure in their portal vein (''portal hypertension''), which is usually due to scarring and hardening of the liver (liver ''cirrhosis'').' "
Why is the TIPS procedure done?,'A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure is used to treat the complications of portal ''hypertension'' that fail to respond to medicines. These complications are as follows:''The TIPS procedure is also performed in patients' Variceal bleeding (bleeding from any of the veins that normally drain the digestive organs into the liver) Severe ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdomen) Hepatic hydrothorax (fluid accumulation in the chest due to liver disease) After liver transplantation With hepatorenal syndrome (development of kidney failure with advanced chronic liver disease) With Budd-Chiari syndrome (a blockage in any of the hepatic veins)
How does a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) work?,"'Blood from all the veins of the ''digestive system'' drains into the superior and inferior mesenteric veins; these two vessels are then joined by a splenic vein to form the portal vein. Thus, the portal vein carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver. Then, there are hepatic veins that carry blood away from the liver back to the ''heart''.''Conditions such as liver ''cirrhosis'' increase the pressure in the portal veins, which puts back pressure in the veins of the digestive tract. This results in enlarged veins (engorged veins) that may lead to bleeding.''By creating a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), the blood flow from the enlarged veins of the digestive organs is redirected to the hepatic veins. This reduces the increased ''blood pressure'' in the portal veins and thus prevents subsequent complications.' "
How Is a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) Procedure Performed?," The doctor orders either ultrasonography (USG) report or computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen to check the status of the veins in the liver. The doctor instructs the patient to discontinue certain medicines for a few days before the procedure. The patient is asked not to eat or drink anything—except a few necessary medicines—for 8-12 hours before the procedure. The patient may be given a sedative medicine to make him relax during the procedure. The doctor inserts a flexible tube into the patient’s neck by making a small incision of ≤1 cm. On the end of this tube is a tiny balloon attached to a metal stent. Using a medical dye and an X-ray machine (fluoroscopy) that help in visualizing the internal structures, the doctor directs the tube into the portal vein. The balloon is inflated to fix the stent at an appropriate place in the vein. The patient may feel a little pain at this time. The doctor uses the stent to connect the portal vein to one of the three hepatic veins. The portal vein pressure is measured to check if it has been reduced with this procedure. The tube and balloon are then removed from the patient’s neck. After the procedure, the wound is cleaned and covered with a sterile bandage. The procedure is completed in about 60-90 minutes. The patient is monitored for a few hours. During this period, the patient’s head is kept elevated. Usually, they get discharged on the next day of the procedure.  If there is significant bleeding, the patient is shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and discharged after a few days."
What are the complications of the TIPS procedure?,'Possible risks associated with the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure are as follows:' Internal bleeding Injury to the liver and heart Infection of the stent Hepatic encephalopathy (an advanced liver disease that leads to brain damage/coma) Heart failure Allergic reaction to the dye Blockage in the stent
What is the recovery time for the TIPS procedure?," The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure is much safer than surgery, and its recovery period is fast. Most people recover well. The TIPS procedure improves the condition in about 80 to 90% of the patients with portal hypertension. Many people can resume their routine activities within 7-10 days. After a few weeks, the doctor will ask the patient for an ultrasonography (USG) report to check if the stent is working correctly."
How Does TMR Work?,"'TMR is a surgical procedure.  It is performed through a small incision in either the left side or the middle of the chest.  Frequently, it is performed along with coronary bypass surgery, occasionally alone.''Once the incision is made, the surgeon exposes the heart muscle.  A laser hand piece is then positioned on the area of the heart to be treated.  A special high-energy, computerized CO''2'' laser is used to create between 20 to 40 one-millimeter-wide channels (about the width of the head of a pin) in the ''left ventricle'' (left lower pumping chamber) of the heart.  The doctor determines how many channels to create during the procedure.  The outer areas of the channels close, but the inside of the channels remain open inside the heart to improve blood flow.''The CO''2'' Heart Laser uses a computer to direct laser beams to the appropriate area of the heart in between heartbeats, when the ventricle is filled with blood and the heart is relatively still.  This helps to prevent electrical disturbances (arrhythmias) in the heart.'""Doctors aren't sure how TMR improves blood flow to the heart.  Clinical evidence suggests blood flow is improved in two ways:""'TMR usually takes one to two hours.  The procedure may last longer if it is combined with other heart procedures.' The channels act as bloodlines.  When the ventricle pumps or squeezes oxygen-rich blood out of the heart, it sends blood through the channels, restoring blood flow to the heart muscle. 
 The procedure may promote angiogenesis, or the growth of new capillaries (small blood vessels) that help supply blood to the heart muscle. "
Who Is a Candidate For TMR?,"'TMR is a treatment option for individuals who:''TMR has shown positive clinical benefits for patients who may require one or two bypass grafts, yet also have other areas of the heart that are not able to be bypassed with direct bypass-surgery.  This is often seen in patients with ''diabetes''.  The surgeon will bypass the targeted blockages and use the CO''2'' Heart Laser on the heart muscle with diffuse disease to achieve more complete blood flow to the heart.''TMR is not suitable for patients whose:' Have severe angina, which limits their daily activities or causes them to wake from pain at night, despite medications. 
 Have pre-operative tests that show ischemia (decreased blood supply to the heart muscle). 
 Have a history of previous bypass surgery or angioplasty, and no further intervention is available. 
 Have been told by their doctor that there is nothing that can be further done to help their symptoms. Heart muscle is severely damaged due to heart attacks; the heart muscle is dead or scarred rather than affected by inadequate blood supply (ischemic). 
 Heart muscle has no areas of ischemia (inadequate blood supply)."
What Types of Tests Will I Need to Determine If I Am a Candidate?,"'Your doctor will first evaluate your medical condition and review your medical history.  Tests required before TMR include:''After reviewing your medical condition and history, along with your test results, your doctor will decide if you are a candidate for the TMR procedure.  If you are eligible, the doctor will discuss the benefits and risks.'  Cardiac catheterization , to visualize your coronary arteries and see if any blockages are present. 
 Other tests to determine blood flow to your heart muscle and the pumping ability of your heart, such as: 
 Echocardiogram

Does TMR Work?,"'In a study - published by ''The New England Journal of Medicine'' (1999), 72% of patients who had TMR experienced an improvement in angina symptoms after 12 months, compared to only 13% patients who were receiving medications for the treatment of their angina symptoms.  The study concluded that TMR patients had:''Research is currently underway to evaluate TMR patients for symptom relief and long-term outcomes.' Relief of chest pain  Improved quality of life 
 Improved blood flow to the heart 
 Decreased hospital admissions "
Is TMR Covered by Insurance?,'TMR is covered by most insurance companies.  Ask your insurance company if you have coverage for this procedure.' 
How Long Is the Hospital Stay?,'The hospital stay is about four to seven days.  The length of stay depends on your overall health and rate of recovery.  Your doctor and surgeon will evaluate you after the surgery and determine when you should return home.' 
Will I Have Improved Health After TMR?,"'After TMR, some patients feel immediate relief from angina symptoms, while others feel improvement over time.  Some patients do not have improved symptoms after TMR, but may have improved activity tolerance.  After TMR, you may still be required to take medications to help your heart and improve blood flow to the heart.  You will need to meet with a cardiologist for frequent follow-up visits so your progress after TMR can be evaluated.' "
How Active Can I be After TMR?,"'Your doctor will discuss specific activity guidelines that are appropriate for you after your procedure.  A supervised cardiac rehabilitation program is recommended to help guide your recovery and help you progress your activity level.''Reviewed by the doctors at  The Cleveland Clinic Heart Center.''Edited by Charlotte E.

Introduction to heart transplant,"'The idea of replacing a bad organ with a good one has been documented in ancient mythology. The first real organ transplants were probably skin grafts that may have been done in India as early as the second century B.C. The first ''heart'' transplant in any animal is credited to Vladimer Demikhov. Working in Moscow in 1946, Demikhov switched the hearts between two ''dogs''. The dogs survived the surgery. The first heart transplant in human beings was done in South Africa in 1967 by Dr. Christiaan Barnard; the patient only lived 18 days. Most of the research that led to successful heart transplantation took place in the United States at Stanford University under the leadership of Dr. Norman Shumway. Once Stanford started reporting better results, other centers started doing heart transplants. However, successful transplantation of a human heart was not ready for widespread clinical application until medications were developed to prevent the recipient from ""rejecting"" the donor heart. This happened in 1983 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug called ''cyclosporine'' (''Gengraf'', ''Neoral''). Before the advent of cyclosporine, overall results of heart transplant were not very good. ' "
What is a heart transplant?,"'Believe it or not, heart transplantation is a relatively simple operation for a cardiac surgeon. In fact, the procedure actually consists of three operations. ''The first operation'' is harvesting the heart from the donor. The donor is usually an unfortunate person who has suffered irreversible ''brain injury'', called ""brain death"". Very often these are patients who have had major ''trauma'' to the head, for example, in an automobile accident. The victim\'s organs, other than the brain, are working well with the help of medications and other ""life support"" that may include a respirator or other devices. A team of physicians, nurses, and technicians goes to the hospital of the donor to remove donated organs once brain death of the donor has been determined. The removed organs are transported on ice to keep them alive until they can be implanted. For the heart, this is optimally less than six hours. So, the organs are often flown by airplane or helicopter to the recipient\'s hospital. ''The second operation'"" is removing the recipient's damaged heart. Removing the damaged heart may be very easy or very difficult, depending on whether the recipient has had previous heart surgery (as is often the case). If there has been previous surgery, cutting through the ""'scar tissue'' may prolong and complicate removal of the heart. ''The third operation'' is probably the easiest; the implantation of the donor heart. Today, this operation basically involves the creation of only five lines of ''stitches'', or ""anastomoses"". These suture lines connect the large blood vessels entering and leaving the heart. Remarkably, if there are no complications, most patients who have had a heart transplant are home about one week after the surgery. The generosity of donors and their families makes organ transplant possible.' "
Who needs a heart transplant?,"'There are not enough donor hearts available for everyone who may need a hear transplant. Therefore, there is a careful selection process in place to assure that hearts are distributed fairly and to those who will benefit most from the donor heart. The heart is just a pump, although a complicated pump. Most patients require a transplant because their hearts can no longer pump well enough to supply blood with oxygen and nutrients to the organs of the body. A smaller number of patients have a good pump, but a bad ""electrical conduction system"" of the heart. This electrical system determines the rate, rhythm and sequence of contraction of the heart muscle. There are all kinds of problems that can occur with the conduction system, including complete interruption of cardiac function causing ''sudden cardiac death''.''While there are many people with ""end-stage"" ''heart disease'' with inadequate function of the heart, not all qualify for a heart transplant. All the other important organs in the body must be in pretty good shape. Transplants cannot be performed in patients with active infection, ''cancer'', or bad ''diabetes mellitus''; patients who smoke or abuse ''alcohol'"" are also not good candidates. It's not easy to be a transplant recipient. These patients need to change their lifestyle and take numerous medications (commonly more than 30 different medications). Hence, all potential transplants patients must undergo psychological testing to identify social and behavioral factors that could interfere with recovery, compliance with medications, and lifestyle changes required after transplantation.""""Moreover, needing a heart and being a suitable candidate are not enough. The potential donor heart must be compatible with the recipient's immune system to decrease the chance of problems with rejection. Finally, this precious resource, the donor organ, must be distributed fairly. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) is in charge of a system that is in place to assure equitable allocation of organs to individuals who will benefit the most from transplantation. These are usually the sickest patients.""  "
What are the results of a heart transplant?,"'When all potential problems are considered, the results of transplantation are remarkably good. Keep in mind that ''heart failure'' is a very serious and life-threatening disease. In patients with severe forms of heart failure that require transplantation, the one year mortality rate (that is the percent of patients who die in within one year) is 80%. Overall, five year survival in patients with any form of heart failure is less than 50%. Compare these outcomes with cardiac transplant. After heart transplant, five year survival averages about 50%-60%. One year survival averages about 85%-90%.' "
What are the complications of a heart transplant?,"'One might ask, ""Why is survival no better than it is after a heart transplant?"" As part of our defense mechanism to fight off infection and even ''cancer'', our bodies have an ""immune system"" to recognize and eliminate foreign tissues such as ''viruses'' and bacteria. Unfortunately, our immune system also attacks transplanted organs. This is what happens when organs are rejected; they are recognized as foreign by the body. Rejection can be controlled with powerful ""immunosuppressive"" medications. If there is not enough immunosuppression the organ can reject acutely. Even when it seems that there is no active rejection, there may be more subtle chronic rejection that consists of a growth of tissue, something like ''scar'' tissue, which causes blockage of the blood vessels of the heart. The blockage of the vessels is the process that ultimately causes the transplanted heart to fail. It is this chronic rejection that is the major limiting factor for the long-term success of heart transplantation.''Unfortunately, immunosuppression is a double-edged sword.  While immunosuppression blocks rejection, because it suppresses the immune system, transplant patients are more susceptible to infection and ''cancers'' of various types.  Among older transplantation patients, as survival has improved, more patients are eventually dying from cancers. ' "
How does a heart transplant patient know if he or she is rejecting the donor organ or developing an infection?,"'This is not an easy question to answer because many of the symptoms and signs of rejection and infection are the same.  These include:''The more specific symptoms and signs of infection will vary greatly depending upon the site of infection within the body.  ''Transplant patients who experience any of these findings need to seek medical attention immediately.''  The transplant physician will then do tests to determine whether the transplanted heart is functioning normally or not.  If there is no evidence of rejection, a thorough search for infection will be performed so that the patient can be treated appropriately.' weakness, fatigue,  malaise (feeling lousy),  fever, and  ""flu-like symptoms"", such as chills, headaches, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting. 
"
How is rejection of the organ diagnosed and monitored?,"'Currently, the gold standard for monitoring rejection is the endomyocardial biopsy. This is a simple operation for the experienced cardiologist and can be done as an outpatient procedure. First, a catheter is put into the jugular vein in the neck. From there, the catheter is advanced into the right side of the heart (''right ventricle'') using an x-ray method calledfluoroscopy for guidance. The catheter has a bioptome at its end, a set of two small cups which can be closed to pinch off and remove small samples of heart muscle. The tissue is processed and placed on glass slides to be reviewed under the microscope by a pathologist. Based on the findings, the pathologist can determine whether or not there is rejection. ''Immunosuppressive therapy is then adjusted, for example, increased if rejection is present. Investigators have tried to develop less invasive methods to monitor for rejection. There is a new high-tech analysis that can be done in a sample of blood that is very promising and much easier for the patient than the endomyocardial biopsy. This test looks at the expression of specific genes in cells in the blood. The amount of expression of key genes indicates whether or not rejection is occurring. While this method has not replaced the endomyocardial biopsy as the gold standard, it has decreased the frequency of biopsies for many patients.' "
Why aren't more heart transplants done?,"""It's not easy to qualify for a heart transplant. One has to have a very bad heart but an otherwise healthy body. However, the major limiting factor is the availability of donor hearts. For many reasons, individuals and families refuse to donate organs that could be life-saving to others. Sometimes, even when an organ is available, there is no good match. Other times, there is no way to get the heart to a suitable recipient in time for the organ to still be viable. Cost is another reason, although less frequent, why more heart transplants aren't done. The cost is always at least a few hundred thousand dollard. Not all insurers will pay for heart transplant. The longer the recipient lives, the more expensive the transplant. Of course, if the heart lasts longer, the benefit is also greater to the patient and to society."" "
What is the future of heart transplant?,"'There are several ways to help patients with end-stage ''heart disease'"". One is to get more donors for heart transplant. This will require teaching people the benefits of transplantation in hope of changing society's attitudes. Better methods of preserving organs and preventing and treating rejection are constantly being developed. In the end, however, there will never be enough donor hearts. Indeed, artificial hearts already exist but have a limited life-span. Patients with artificial hearts are at high risk of developing infection and ""'blood clots'' related to the device. Better devices are being developed all the time. What about the use of animal organs, also called xenotransplantation? These organs are too ""foreign"" and thus the problems with rejection are currently insurmountable. ' "
Is transradial cardiac catheterization painful?,"'Transradial ''cardiac catheterization'' is performed using local anesthesia, and may take an hour or more, depending on the procedure performed. The patient usually feels nothing more than a short stinging ''pain'' from the initial numbing injection. The patient will be administered painkillers and mild sedation before the procedure. There might be a certain amount of post-procedural soreness that can be resolved with painkillers.' "
How is a transradial cardiac catheterization performed?,"'A transradial cardiac catheterization is performed by a specially trained interventional cardiovascular physician. The catheterization may be performed through the left or right radial artery, though it is done mostly through the right side.''The patient may be required to''The anesthesiologist' Undergo blood tests Undergo cardiac radiography tests such as Chest X-ray echocardiography electrocardiography Avoid eating or drinking for eight hours prior to the procedure Inform the doctor of any allergies Inform the doctor if pregnant Check with the doctor before taking any regular medications Administers painkillers and sedation through an IV line Connects the patient to the electrocardiogram to monitor the heart’s electrical impulse Monitors the patient’s vital functions includingheart rateblood pressureoxygen levels heart rate blood pressure oxygen levels The cardiologistEvaluates the blood flow in the wrist and handInjects a local anesthetic in the wristAdministers medications to preventArterial spasmArterial blood clot (thrombosis)Makes a tiny incision in the skin on the wristPunctures the radial artery and inserts the catheter using a guidewireGently advances the catheter through the artery towards the heart using ultrasound images for guidanceInjects a dye to scan the blood vessels through fluoroscopyPerforms the necessary procedure to identify and treat the diseaseWithdraws the catheter back through the radial arteryApplies pressure on the insertion site to arrest bleeding, and places a bandage over it Evaluates the blood flow in the wrist and hand Injects a local anesthetic in the wrist Administers medications to preventArterial spasmArterial blood clot (thrombosis) Arterial spasm Arterial blood clot (thrombosis) Makes a tiny incision in the skin on the wrist Punctures the radial artery and inserts the catheter using a guidewire Gently advances the catheter through the artery towards the heart using ultrasound images for guidance Injects a dye to scan the blood vessels through fluoroscopy Performs the necessary procedure to identify and treat the disease Withdraws the catheter back through the radial artery Applies pressure on the insertion site to arrest bleeding, and places a bandage over it"
How long does it take to recover from a transradial heart catheterization?,"'The patient is usually kept under observation for a few hours after the procedure. The patient’s vital signs will be monitored until they are stable and anesthetic effects wear off. Most patients will be able to go home the same day or the next.''Most people can resume light activities in a week. However, heavy lifting and strenuous activities must be avoided. Patients must have regular checkups to assess cardiovascular health. Some patients with a weakened system due to ''cardiovascular disease'' may have to make permanent changes in lifestyle and food habits.' "
What are the risks and complications of a transradial cardiac catheterization?,"'Transradial cardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive procedure to diagnose and correct problems in a vital organ. The risks are low, considering it is usually a life-saving procedure.''Complications of transradial cardiac catheterization include' Radial artery spasm that can cause intense pain Radial artery block (occlusion) resulting in deficient blood supply to hand (hand ischemia) Allergic reaction to medications or dye material Injury toHeartLungBlood vesselsNervesLymphatic ductsNerves and blood vessels in the wrist Heart Lung Blood vessels Nerves Lymphatic ducts Nerves and blood vessels in the wrist Bleeding and infection at the catheter insertion site Blood clots which can cause a stroke Irregular heartbeat Complications from treatment procedures performed"
What is a transradial heart catheterization procedure?,"'Transradial ''cardiac catheterization'' is a minimally invasive procedure to diagnose and treat certain cardiovascular diseases. A thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted through the radial artery in the hand and into the ''heart'' and its blood vessels. ''Ultrasound'' scanning and continuous X-ray (fluoroscopy) are used for guidance during the procedure.''Traditionally, the primary route for cardiac catheterization has been the femoral vein in the groin (transfemoral). The catheters used in the earlier days were larger and needed a large blood vessel to go through. Advancement in technology has made transradial catheterization possible with thinner catheters that can go through smaller blood vessels.' "
Advantages of transradial approach over transfemoral," Improved patient comfort, since patients don’t have to lie flat for a long period after the procedure, as is the case with transfemoral approach. Less expensive and shorter hospital stay. Lower risk forBleeding at the catheter entry site, because the radial artery is small and superficial, and bleeding can be easily controlled with gentle pressure.Hematoma and blood collecting inside the layers of the vascular wall (pseudoaneurysm). Bleeding at the catheter entry site, because the radial artery is small and superficial, and bleeding can be easily controlled with gentle pressure. Hematoma and blood collecting inside the layers of the vascular wall (pseudoaneurysm). No risk of bleeding in the abdominal cavity (retroperitoneal hemorrhage). Beneficial for patients whoare elderlyhave back problems and find it difficult to lie flathave acute coronary syndrome and are on anti-platelet therapy to prevent blood clottinghave a major coronary artery blockage (ST-elevated myocardial infarction) are elderly have back problems and find it difficult to lie flat have acute coronary syndrome and are on anti-platelet therapy to prevent blood clotting have a major coronary artery blockage (ST-elevated myocardial infarction)"
Disadvantages of transradial approach, Technically more challenging and requires a high level of expertise to negotiate the loops in the radial artery and aortic arch. Increased procedural time resulting in increased radiation exposure from fluoroscopy. (The procedural time reduces with experience level of the surgeon).
What is a cardiac catheterization done for?,"'A transradial cardiac catheterization may be performed for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.''Therapeutic''A transradial approach is avoided' Location of narrowing (stenosis), or blocks in the coronary blood vessels (angiogram) Evaluation of the condition and functioning of heart valves Detection of congenital heart defects Measurement of pressure and oxygen levels in the heart (hemodynamic assessment) Assessment of the heart’s pumping function (ventriculogram) Extraction of tissue sample for biopsy Dilations of stenosed blood vessels and removing blocks (angioplasty) Placement of stent in the coronary arteries Correction of congenital defects Dilation of narrowed heart valves (balloon valvuloplasty) Repair and replacement of heart valves Treatment of irregular heartbeat with cardiac ablation (scarring heart tissue to stop abnormal electrical impulses) Closing off a part of the heart’s atrium (left atrial appendage) to prevent formation of clots in people who are at high risk for clots If the patient’s radial artery is too small to insert the catheter If transradial access is blocked for any reason In hemodialysis patients, in the hand in which they have a shunt for dialysis"
What is prenatal ultrasound?,"'Like other ''ultrasound'' examinations, ''prenatal'' or fetal ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to obtain images of the fetus, placenta, and amniotic sac in a ''pregnant'' woman. The test does not involve ''radiation'' and is completely safe for both mother and baby. An ultrasound examination is also known as a ''sonogram''. The entire procedure can be performed in 30 minutes or less.\xa0Two types of ultrasound exams are used in ''pregnancy''.''Two types of ultrasound exams are used in pregnancy. The most common is a transabdominal ultrasound, in which the measuring instrument (transducer) is moved over the surface of the abdomen after a gel has been applied. Sometimes a full bladder is required to obtain better images, so you may be asked to drink several glasses of water before the test. There is no ''pain'"" or discomfort associated with the test, and it can be performed in the doctor's office.""""Transvaginal ultrasound uses a probe that is inserted directly into the vagina. It is performed in the doctor's office similar to a pelvic examination. This type of exam is most commonly used in the early weeks of pregnancy to rule out suspected problems or to assess the gestational age of the embryo. In early pregnancy this examination can provide more accurate information then a transabdominal examination.""  Transabdominal ultrasound Transvaginal ultrasound"
Why is prenatal ultrasound performed?,"'As mentioned above, transvaginal ultrasound is most often used in the early weeks of pregnancy to rule out problems or to determine how far along you are in the pregnancy. Most pregnant women receive a transabdominal ultrasound around the 20th week of pregnancy. This exam confirms that the baby is growing normally and that the placenta is attached normally. The heartbeat of the fetus is visible, and the movement of the fetus can be observed. Major ''birth defects'' can be visualized by this method, as well. In most cases, it is possible to determine the sex of the baby through an ultrasound exam at 20 weeks, but this method is not 100% accurate. You can tell the examiner whether or not you wish to know the gender of your baby at the time of the examination.''Ultrasound may also be performed earlier or later in the pregnancy for specific reasons that include:' Determination of multiple gestation Ensuring the health of the baby and 
monitoring its growth Determining the location of the 
placenta Estimation of gestational age and due 
date Assessing the expected size and weight 
of the baby Determining the amount of amniotic 
fluid Determining the position of the baby"
What are 3D and 4D ultrasound?,"'A 3D ultrasound provides a particularly clear image that resembles a photograph. A so-called 4D ultrasound provides this image in real time. Sometimes these ultrasound images are offered by non-medical providers in stores or other locations. Medical authorities, including The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Food and Drug Administration do not recommend using these services because the examiners may not have received proper training and could provide inaccurate information.' "
Are there risks associated with prenatal ultrasound?,"'As mentioned before, there is no radiation exposure during a prenatal ultrasound. Ultrasound exams have been used for many years, and studies have never shown any harms associated with the procedure, either on a short- or long-term basis.' "
What is a Liver Biopsy?,"'A ''liver'' biopsy is a procedure in which a small needle is inserted into the liver to collect a tissue sample. This is performed as an office or outpatient procedure or during surgery. The tissue is then analyzed in a laboratory to help doctors diagnose a variety of disorders and diseases in the liver. A liver biopsy is most often performed to help identify the cause of:' Persistent abnormal liver blood tests (liver enzymes). Unexplained yellowing of the skin (jaundice). A liver abnormality found on ultrasound, CT scan, or nuclear scan. Unexplained enlargement of the liver."
Is Liver Biopsy Safe?,"'In most instances, there are no complications in obtaining a liver biopsy. However, rarely ''internal bleeding'' may occur, as well as a leak of bile from the liver or gallbladder.' "
How Do I Prepare for a Liver Biopsy?,"'When preparing for a liver biopsy, there are several things to keep in mind.''Do not discontinue any medication without first consulting with your primary or referring doctor.' Tell your doctor if you're pregnant, have a lung or heart condition, are allergic to any medications, or have bleeding problems. Tell your doctor if you are taking blood-thinning medications such as Coumadin, Plavix, or Persantine. Your doctor may prescribe an alternate method for thinning your blood before the procedure. For the week before the procedure, do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Motrin, Naprosyn, or Indocin) unless otherwise advised by your doctor."
What Happens on the Day of a Liver Biopsy?,"'Laboratory tests will be performed on the day of a liver biopsy or 2-3 days before the procedure, as directed by your doctor. These tests may include a blood count, a ''platelet count'"", and a measurement of your blood's ability to clot.""'Before the procedure:''During the procedure:''After the procedure:' A doctor will explain the biopsy procedure in detail, including possible complications and answer any questions you may have. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. You will lie on your back, with your right elbow out to the side and your right hand under your head. It is important that you remain as still as possible during the procedure. An ultrasound may be used to mark the location of your liver. You may receive a small dose of a sedative just prior to the procedure. The doctor cleans and numbs an area on your upper abdomen with a local anesthetic (pain-relieving medication). The doctor then makes a small incision on your upper abdomen and inserts a needle into this incision to take a small sample of liver tissue for analysis. The procedure takes about 5 minutes. You will stay in a recovery room for up to 4 hours for observation. You may feel minor discomfort or a dull pain in your shoulders or back. If necessary, a pain medication will be prescribed for you. Do not drive or operate machinery for at least eight hours after the procedure. Avoid taking aspirin, products containing aspirin, or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen, Advil, Naprosyn, Indocin, or Motrin) for one week after the procedure. You may takeacetaminophen (Tylenol) if needed. Do not perform vigorous physical activity for at least 24 hours after the biopsy. Your doctor will discuss the biopsy results with you several days after the procedure."
What other methods of liver biopsy are available?,"'Two other methods of liver biopsy may also be available: laparoscopic and transvenous.''During a laparoscopic biopsy'', a laparoscope (a thin lighted tube with a camera attached) is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. The laparoscope sends images of the liver to a monitor that the physician watches while using instruments to remove tissue samples from one or more parts of the liver. This type of biopsy may be used when tissue samples are needed from specific parts of the liver.'' A transvenous biopsy'' may be done when patients have blood-clotting problems or fluid in the abdomen. The physician inserts a tube called a catheter into a vein in the neck and guides it to the liver. A biopsy needle is placed into the catheter and then into the liver to obtain a sample.' "
Warning About Liver Biopsy,"'If you have a ''fever''; difficulty ''breathing''; ''chills''; ''dizziness''; or tenderness or severe pain at the site of a liver biopsy or in the chest, shoulder, or abdomen within 72 hours after the procedure, please call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.' "
Why should travelers see a physician before they leave on a trip?,"'Travelers'' should see a physician before leaving for a trip if''The goal of a pre-travel medical evaluation is to help travelers protect themselves against (1) common diseases that may be mild but that will disrupt their trip and (2) less common diseases that may be serious or even fatal. All travelers need to be up to date on routine ''vaccines'' they would normally get if they were not traveling.  For example, an annual ''influenza'' vaccination (''flu shot'') is recommended if traveling during influenza season. Travelers should also be up to date on ''tetanus'' ''vaccines''. If a ''tetanus'' booster is needed, a physician may elect to use the Tdap ''vaccine'' that also provides continuing protect against adult ''pertussis''. No immunizations are required for re-entry into the United States after travel. Some countries require you to provide an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis prior to allowing border entry from certain countries, even if you are only stopping there to change planes, whether you are traveling to your destination or coming home. '  they are going to developing countries, they are visiting sites that are not on the usual tourist routes or traveling to high altitudes, they have chronic diseases that could be affected by travel, they are visiting countries that require vaccinations before they allow travelers to enter the country."
"What diseases occur in travelers, and how can disease be prevented?","'Travelers can pick up infectious diseases from contaminated food or water, from ''insect bites'"", animal bites, or from other people. Immunizations, medications, and simple precautions can reduce or eliminate the risk of many of these travel-related infections. While infectious disease is the most common concern for travelers, it is important to remember that the most common cause of death in travelers is motor-vehicle accidents. Be sure to look both ways before crossing the street, review traffic laws (especially in countries where people drive on the opposite side of the road), don't get in a car with a driver who is drunk, and use seat belts and infant/child car seats if available both at home and when traveling.""'This review will cover infectious diseases commonly encountered by travelers or those for which vaccinations are recommended. For a more complete discussion of what may be need for travel to specific destinations and specific situations, please refer to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) ''Traveler'""'s Health web site (""'http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/'').' "
Traveler's diarrhea,"""Traveler's diarrhea""' is the most common medical complaint in travelers, occurring in up to 50% of travelers to developing countries.  It occurs when infectious organisms are inadvertently ingested by travelers, resulting in one to five days of ''loose stools''. The stools are often watery and may be accompanied by abdominal ''cramps'"". Although not fatal, traveler's ""'diarrhea'' can cause ''dehydration'', ''vomiting'', low-grade ''fever'"", and discomfort to the point that some travelers have to change their itineraries. It is important to note that traveler's ""'diarrhea'' is not associated with bloody stools, severe ''abdominal pain'', or high ''fever''. These symptoms are suggestive of more serious conditions and should prompt medical attention.'""Traveler's ""'diarrhea'' is spread when bacteria or other infectious agents such as ''viruses'"" are ingested. Traveler's diarrhea is most often spread through contaminated food or water, or by putting contaminated hands in the mouth. Even small amounts of contamination can cause infection. Although bacteria are the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea, there have been outbreaks of diarrhea on cruise ships caused by viruses known as noroviruses. Noroviruses spread readily from person to person.""'Travelers can get diarrhea in most areas of the world, but some countries pose a higher risk. High-risk areas include most of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Central and South America. Risk is increased if the traveler is adventurous with his or her ''diet'', eats foods from street vendors, or travels to areas off the usual tourist routes.'' Protective measures may help prevent or shorten the duration of traveler\'s diarrhea. All travelers should wash their hands often and understand basic food and water precautions (see ""What is safe to eat and drink while traveling?""). However, it has been shown that even well-informed travelers often choose to eat foods that pose an increased risk of traveler\'s diarrhea. Therefore, travelers at risk should carry in their first-aid kit an antimotility agent such as ''loperamide'' (''Imodium''; ''Kaopectate II''; Imodium A-D; ''Maalox Anti-Diarrheal'' Caplets; Pepto Diarrhea Cont) and start taking it if they get symptoms. Bismuth subsalicylate (''Pepto-Bismol'') is also helpful.'' Because bacteria are developing resistance to many antibiotics, many older antibiotics do not work, and those prescribed currently may not be effective in the future. Antibiotics also have risks of their own and do not protect against viruses or parasites; therefore, routine prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for most travelers. However, many physicians recommend that travelers carry along an antibiotic to take in case they get diarrhea. Fluoroquinolones, such as ''ciprofloxacin'', ''levofloxacin'', ''ofloxacin'', or ''norfloxacin'', are the most commonly prescribed antibiotic; ''azithromycin'' (''Zithromax'', ''Zmax'') or ''rifaximin'' (''Xifaxan'') are alternatives. If an antimotility agent (a drug that reduces gastrointestinal motility) and an antibiotic are started at the first sign of diarrhea, symptoms may be shortened to only a few hours instead of a few days.'' Physicians might prescribe daily antibiotics or daily bismuth subsalicylate to prevent diarrhea in people who are immunosuppressed, or when the purpose of a trip would be severely impacted if it were interrupted by diarrhea. This is not needed for most travelers, and bismuth subsalicylate may cause adverse effects in doses required for protection. ''Pregnant'' women and children need special advice because many of these ''drugs'' are not appropriate for them. Affected people should stay well hydrated with ''beverages'' that are sealed, treated with chlorine, boiled, or are otherwise known to be purified; in most cases, commercial sports ''drinks'"" are adequate, but very sugary drinks can worsen diarrhea. If antibiotics are prescribed, fill the prescription before travel; if you must buy drugs during a trip to an area of the world with few drug regulations, avoid counterfeits by using a licensed pharmacy, asking the pharmacist about the ingredients, and checking the packaging for poor print quality or odd appearance; drugs should be in the manufacturer's original packaging if at all possible.

Malaria,"'''Malaria'' is an infection caused by a protozoan that enters ''red blood cells'' and multiplies until the cells burst open. The broken cells release the young protozoa into the bloodstream where they infect more red blood cells. This release of young protozoa causes high ''fevers'' that can last for several hours, as well as ''anemia'' due to the destruction of ''red cells''. The fever of ''malaria'' often comes and goes, coinciding with when the infected red cells burst open. With some types of malaria, the protozoa can hide in the ''liver'' and cause episodes of fever over many years. In serious cases, malaria can cause the kidneys to shut down, can infect the brain (cerebral malaria), or cause death.'' Malaria is spread to people by mosquitoes. The mosquitoes bite between dusk and dawn. Malaria occurs in many tropical areas and a few areas that have a milder climate. Travelers to sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and Asia may be at risk for the disease. Some countries in Central America and the Caribbean also have malaria. Not every area of a country will be affected. The people who have lived all their lives in the area with malaria typically have some immunity, but travelers are at much higher risk for severe infection, especially with some types of malaria. Malaria is serious enough to see a doctor about possible preventive medication if your itinerary suggests you might be exposed. The CDC has a web page that tells where malaria occurs (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/). Many public-health departments and some private travel clinics provide pre-travel evaluations. CDC also offers a ""Find a Clinic"" web page to help you find one (''http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/find-clinic''). The American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene also has a list of clinics that specialize in travel medicine (''http://www.astmh.org/source/ClinicalDirectory/'').You should visit these clinics at least four to six weeks before you travel in case you need ''vaccines'', but especially with malaria it is better to go later than not at all to avoid traveling unprotected.''Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites (see ""What can I do to avoid ''insect bites''?"") and by taking preventive medications. Travelers who will be exposed to malaria should take medications starting before travel to the area and continuing for a time after they leave the area. Several different medicines are available. Some are taken only once a week, and others are taken daily. In some countries, malaria has become resistant to older medicines. Your physician or travel clinic will choose which medicine to use based on what countries you are visiting. Some medicines must be started two weeks before departure, so you should plan to go to the doctor or travel clinic well in advance.  It is very important to take every last dose of preventive medication that may be prescribed to take after you return home, especially with types of malaria that hide in the liver and can return months later.

Meningitis and encephalitis,"'There are several causes of meningitis, an infection of the lining and fluid around the brain and spinal cord. ''Encephalitis'' means that the brain tissue itself is also infected. There are serious types of meningitis and ''encephalitis'' that are associated with travel and can be prevented.''''Meningococcal meningitis'' is one of the most serious types associated with travel to certain areas. The cause is a bacterium called ''Neisseria meningitidis''. The disease can be quite severe or even fatal. The infection is spread from person to person by close contact through ''coughing'' or ''sneezing'' or other respiratory means.'' Meningococcal meningitis occurs at low rates throughout the world, including the United States. However, some countries have high rates of disease and pose a special risk to travelers. This includes many countries in the ""meningitis belt"" of sub-Saharan Africa. Saudi Arabia has experienced outbreaks when pilgrims travel to religious sites.'' There are two effective vaccines to prevent meningitis. The choice of vaccine depends on the age of the patient. The vaccines are synthetic (meaning that they do not contain live infectious agents). They should not be given to people who have previously had a neurological illness called Guillain-Barré syndrome. Meningitis immunizations are now routinely recommended for adolescents and college freshmen in the United States. It is also recommended for travelers who are going to areas that have high rates of infection. Vaccination is required for pilgrims to religious sites in Saudi Arabia, and proof of vaccination (preferably an International Certificate of Vaccination) will be required at the border. The vaccination is effective for three to five years (depending on which of the two vaccines is given), after which revaccination may be recommended for travelers who travel to areas with high rates of infection.'' There are several kinds of viral encephalitis that occur in various areas of the world, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, which are spread by mosquito bites. They are fortunately rare, and most viral encephalitis is prevented by avoiding mosquito bites (see the section on insect precautions). Japanese encephalitis virus is preventable by vaccine, and a doctor or travel clinic can advise if you will need it.'' Meningitis and encephalitis caused by parasites (amoebae) is also a concern for travelers. Harmless amoebae are common in freshwater and plumbing all over the world. ''Naegleria fowleri'' prefers hot springs, lakes, rivers, or any warm freshwater that is untreated for human use; it may grow in pipes and hot water tanks of homes and buildings as chlorine dissipates. If affected water with enough''Naegleria'' is inhaled, it may cause severe  ''meningoencephalitis''; death occurs in 97%-99% of cases. This type of meningitis is hard to diagnose, children are often affected, and effective treatment is still being studied. Prevention is very easy. If bathing in hot springs or bodies of fresh water with unknown chlorination during hot seasons, keep the head above water, hold the nose shut, or use nose clips. Avoid getting bath or hose water up the nose. If you rinse your sinuses, or practice religious nasal cleansing, tap water is safe if boiled for at least one minute and left to cool. Other options include using chemical disinfectants, filters with an absolute pore size 1 micron or less, and distilled or sterile water. Drinking affected water cannot transmit''Naegleria'', and it cannot live in saltwater. ' "
Yellow fever,"'Yellow fever'' virus is a rare cause of illness in U.S. travelers, but it can be serious, and some countries require proof of vaccination before border entry. It is caused by a virus that attacks the liver. Symptoms start within three to five days of infection. In many people, the disease is mild and goes away. About 15% of people will develop severe disease with liver failure, and up to half will die. ''Yellow fever'' is spread by the bite of a mosquito.'' Yellow fever occurs in areas of sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, and South America. Not all countries in these areas have yellow fever. Even within a country, some areas may have yellow fever while others do not.'' There is a very effective vaccine available to prevent yellow fever. It contains a live virus that has been modified (""attenuated"") to make it safer. Vaccine side effects are usually mild. Rarely (a few cases per million doses), the vaccine virus can spread and cause severe disease. Infants under 6 months old, and people with weak immune systems (for example, people with certain chronic diseases, and some people with ''HIV'' infection or ''cancer'') should not receive the live vaccine. These people should consult with a doctor before traveling to an area where yellow fever occurs. For people 60 or over and pregnant or ''breastfeeding'' women, a doctor should carefully review the risks and benefits of the vaccine.'""Vaccination is generally recommended for travelers who will be exposed to yellow fever with the above exceptions. The vaccine may be required for entry into some countries. Check the CDC web site to see if vaccination is required for your trip. If you get vaccinated, you should receive an International Certificate of Vaccination, signed and validated with the center's stamp where the vaccine was given. If you cannot be vaccinated, a medical waiver can be given. Take the certificate and any waivers with you on your trip. You may need it to enter your destination country or get back home. This certificate is valid for 10 years, and some countries are starting to accept it as valid for life. Yellow fever vaccine is only given at authorized U.S. yellow fever vaccine clinics, so you will need to check well in advance. CDC can help you find a place to get yellow fever vaccine (""'http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellow-fever-vaccination-clinics-search.aspx'').''The first line of defense against illness transmitted by insects is prevention of bites (see ""What can I do to avoid insect bites?"").' "
Hepatitis A,"'Hepatitis A'' is caused by a virus that infects the liver. People get sick two to six weeks after they get the virus. Symptoms include ''nausea'', yellowing of the skin and eyes (''jaundice''), ''dark urine'', pale stools, ''loss of appetite'', and ''fatigue''. The symptoms take two to six months to completely resolve. Unlike some other ''hepatitis'' viruses, ''hepatitis A'' does not cause chronic ''liver disease''. In other words, once the person gets better, he or she is completely cured. Some infected people (especially children) are asymptomatic, meaning that they do not develop symptoms. ''Hepatitis'' A is spread when human waste is mistakenly ingested. Even a small amount can cause disease, such as might occur by ''shaking hands'' with someone with contaminated hands and then touching the mouth. Food preparers have transmitted disease by mistakenly contaminating food. It is also possible to get hepatitis A through sexual contact or contaminated needles or blood. Hepatitis A occurs throughout the world but is more common in developing countries. ''There is an effective vaccine that is quite good at preventing hepatitis A. If you are traveling to a developing country, your doctor will probably recommend vaccination. In a few cases, if you will be traveling before the vaccine has time to take effect, your doctor might recommend a more temporary measure called gamma globulin instead of or in addition to the vaccine. Remember to follow food and water precautions (see ""What is safe to eat and drink while traveling?""). The vaccine also requires a second dose six to 12 months later for full protection (or two or three more doses if combined with ''hepatitis B vaccine''), so you will to follow up with your doctor after coming home. However, ''hepatitis A vaccine'' is protective for at least 25 years.' "
Typhoid fever,"'Typhoid fever'' is an infection caused by a bacterium called ''Salmonella typhi''. Most people who get sick develop a ''headache'', a very high fever (up to 103 F or 104 F), and ''fatigue''.   ''Nausea'', ''abdominal pain'', diarrhea, or ''constipation'' may also occur.''The disease spreads when infected human waste contaminates food or water or is otherwise ingested. Some people are able to carry the bacteria inside their body for a very long time (""carriers""), even after symptoms have disappeared. Carriers can get it again or spread it to other people. People who get sick may be given antibiotics by their doctor. In addition to the antibiotics, people should make sure they always wash their hands after toileting and before cooking, so that they don\'t spread the disease to anyone else. Some occupations require proof that you no longer carry any typhoid bacteria before you may go back to work; a doctor may perform several cultures of your ''stool'' before clearing you for work.''Typhoid fever occurs in many areas around the world, especially Asia, Africa, and South America. A vaccine is available to reduce the risk of getting typhoid, and it lasts several years. Ask a doctor or local public-health department about typhoid vaccination before you travel. Food and water precautions (see ""What is safe to eat and drink while traveling?"") also reduce the risk of disease. The saying ""''Boil'' it, cook it, peel it, or forget it!"" helps you remember how to prevent becoming sick with typhoid fever (and many other infections) while traveling. ' "
Polio,"'''Polio'' is a viral illness that can lead to severe neuromuscular problems. Polio is spread from person to person. Infected oral secretions and feces can cause disease. Many people have no symptoms, but some have neurological problems such as ''weakness'' and ''paralysis''. Symptoms are especially severe if they involve the ''breathing'' muscles. Some people are left with permanent neurological disabilities such as paralysis of limbs or breathing muscles.''Thanks to a global public-health campaign, many countries no longer have polio. A few countries in Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East still have outbreaks. The list of infected countries is constantly changing, as some countries successfully eliminate the infection and others become reinfected. If there is international spread from a country within 12 months, the World Health Organization (WHO) may declare a public-health emergency and issue updated vaccine requirements for travelers staying in those countries longer than four weeks. Proof of vaccination on an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis may be required before leaving. Check the CDC web site (http://cdc.gov/travel) for an update to see if your itinerary includes any of these countries.''The inactivated polio vaccine is recommended if the traveler is going to an area where polio is still occurring. Unless special circumstances arise as above, a single lifetime booster dose in adulthood is sufficient if the traveler has received the usual vaccine series in childhood. If the traveler has not been fully vaccinated in the past (has not received all doses at recommended times), more doses may be needed.' "
Cholera,"'''Cholera'' is an infection caused by bacteria (''Vibrio'' cholerae'') that look like curved rods when viewed under the microscope. The bacteria attach to the lining of the ''intestines'' and secrete a toxin. The cholera toxin can causes the cells in the intestines to pour out life-threatening amounts of fluid. The excess water loss can lead to watery diarrhea, so severe that it is difficult to keep the body hydrated.  The term ""rice water"" is often used to describe this diarrhea because of the appearance of small white flecks of ''mucus'' in liquid.''Cholera spreads when human waste contaminates water and food. Because it takes high numbers of bacteria to cause infection, the contamination usually has to be quite significant. For example, in areas of poor sanitation, cholera can be spread when the drinking water supply is contaminated by feces from people who are sick.'' Cholera is most common in areas that have poor sanitation, with faulty sewage systems or contaminated drinking water. Asia, Africa, and Latin America have been affected for several decades. Cholera can be prevented by using proper sanitation and sewage treatment. Boiling, filtering, or chlorinating water can help to prevent the spread of cholera. Treatment is mainly oral rehydration with simple ''electrolyte'' solutions. There is no vaccine for cholera that is approved in the United States. Following food and water precautions is the first line of defense (see ""What is safe to eat and drink while traveling?"").''Cholera is very rare in recreational travelers, but travelers providing humanitarian aid to underdeveloped areas, or areas were sanitation and water supply is disrupted by disaster, should be aware of the risk of cholera. Basic knowledge of hand hygiene, infection control measures, and correct sanitation procedures can avoid inadvertent spread of infections and keep aid workers healthy and able to help. ' "
What about diseases for which there is no vaccine or preventive medication?,"'There are several diseases of concern for travelers for which there is no vaccine or medicine to prevent infection. Among these are some viral infections, ''sexually transmitted diseases'', and parasitic infections. ''Many viral infections can be spread by biting insects such as ''ticks'' or mosquitoes. These include serious infections like hemorrhagic ''fevers'', viral infections that cause high fever, and bleeding. While epidemics have been rare, ''Ebola virus'' has spread in an unprecedented way in recent years, in certain areas of Africa and beyond. ''Ebola'' has been associated with eating wild-caught bats, monkeys, and other animals. Most travelers do not encounter these types of viral hemorrhagic fevers.''''Dengue fever'' occurs throughout the world in tropical areas. ''Symptoms of dengue'' fever are high fever, severe ''headache'' and ''joint pain'', and a drop in ''blood pressure''; occasionally, bleeding (hemorrhage) can occur in people who are reinfected. Chikungunya fever is native to Africa and Asia but has rapidly spread into the Caribbean in the same areas as dengue. Spread by the same mosquitoes, it causes high fever, severe joint ''pain'', and may be indistinguishable from dengue; fever resolves after a few days. Severe joint ''pain'' may last for several weeks, but it leaves no permanent joint damage. The key to preventing these infections is to follow insect precautions (see ""What can I do to avoid insect bites?"").'' Sexually transmitted diseases remain common and can be acquired anywhere in the world. ''HIV'' is a risk everywhere and remains incurable. ''Gonorrhea'', ''chlamydia'', and ''syphilis'' remain common. The only sure way to prevent disease is to abstain from sexual intercourse. Correct use of ''condoms'' will reduce risk as well as unintended ''pregnancy''. ''HPV'' vaccines now available will reduce the risk of acquiring infection with the ''human papillomavirus'' virus that causes ''genital warts'' and ''cervical cancer''.'' Parasites occur in most areas of the world but are especially common in tropical and subtropical regions. Some are spread by eating contaminated food (see ""What is safe to eat and drink while traveling?""), while others are spread by direct contact with infected water or soil. Most travelers do not get parasitic infections, but those who are going into rural areas of developing countries should ask their doctors about parasites they might encounter. '' Infectious-disease outbreaks occur periodically, and officials may recommend additional precautions. Examples have included outbreaks of bovine spongiform encephalitis (''mad cow disease'') or ''severe acute respiratory syndrome'' (''SARS''). Travelers should check the CDC web site to obtain health and risk information specific to their destination country. CDC also has specific advice for special groups and situations (''http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/common-travel-health-topics'').' "
What is safe to eat and drink while traveling?,"  The first line of defense against illness at home and abroad is good hand hygiene. Wash hands with soap and uncontaminated water. If water quality is unknown, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% ethanol often and before eating or drinking. In general, it is best not to drink tap water in a developing country. Boiled water and drinks made from boiled water (tea) are usually safe. Carbonated bottled water or sodas are usually safe. Uncarbonated bottled water may be safe, but even bottled water may be filled up from the local tap water source. Iodine tablets or commercially available water filters may be used to purify water when camping. Ice (including flavored shaved ice or popsicles) is not safe in areas where the water supply may be contaminated. Make ice from disinfected or bottled, sealed water. Alcohol (beer, wine) is usually safe. Fruits and vegetables washed in contaminated water may have a residue of bacteria. In general, wash in clean water and peel them yourself. Hot, well-cooked foods are usually safe. Avoid runny eggs. Avoid street vendor food. Avoid salsas and salads made with raw ingredients. Avoid unpasteurized dairy products. Spices do not kill bacteria. Food can be so spicy that it burns your mouth and still cause traveler's diarrhea or more serious diseases. Foods that put the traveler at high risk for infection include undercooked meat or seafood and bush meat (wild game such as bats, monkeys, other jungle game)."
What can I do to avoid insect bites?," Wear light, protective clothing. Use insect repellents that contain DEET (most popular brand-name insect repellents in the United States contain DEET), or picaridin, IR3535, and some oil of lemon eucalyptus and para-menthane-diol products. Reapply according to directions. When using sunscreen, apply sunscreen first and then repellent. If you are hiking, tuck your pant legs into your sock. Check yourself over for ticks at the end of the hike including all creases, navel, and scalp. Many species bite in the nymph stage and are very small. Removing them within 24 hours prevents most infections. Use mosquito nets or window screens if they are available. Products that contain permethrin (NIX, an insect repellent) are available to spray on your clothes or tent for added protection.
"
What should be in my travel first-aid kit or medicine kit?,"  Your kit should be packed in your carry-on luggage. Prescription medications that you take at home Medications that your doctor recommended to prevent travel-related illness, 
including malaria medications, if indicated Over-the-counter medicines to treat minor illnesses (heartburn, headache, head cold, mild diarrhea, motion sickness, travel sickness) Sunscreen, lotion to use to treat sunburn Insect repellents Alcohol based sanitizer with over 60% ethanol content Bandages, tape, thermometer, and tweezers Other items according to your itinerary. Adventure travelers who are far from medical help will need to consider additional items such as water purification tablets, commercial suture/syringe kits to be used by local health-care provider (ask your doctor for a letter on letterhead stationary prescribing its use), and other necessities. Condoms, especially if there is a chance you may have sex with new partners Women who get vaginal yeast infections should consider carrying along a treatment course (pills or vaginal products)
"
What are the medical concerns with jet lag?,"'Jet lag'' happens when travelers cross several time zones and disrupt their normal ''sleep''-wake cycle. ''To reduce the duration and the symptoms of jet lag, try to be outside when the sun is up. It may make for a very long (or short) first day, but it will help you adjust more quickly. Some travelers also try to change their ''sleep''-wake habits before they leave. ''Medicines are available that can promote sleep, but there are few studies on how well they work with jet lag. ''Zolpidem'' (''Ambien'') is a prescription sedative that promotes sleep. Another group of prescription drugs known as ''benzodiazepines'' also promotes sleep, but they may have more side effects, including temporary ''amnesia''. ''Melatonin'' is a natural hormone available as an herbal preparation in the United States. Doses of approximately 5 mg have been shown to induce sleep. Melatonin is available over the counter. ' "
What if I have a medical condition or a chronic disease?,"'Careful preparation will allow most travelers with medical conditions to have a safe and enjoyable trip. See your physician before traveling to be sure your understand how to manage your condition while traveling. In some cases, an ''exercise'' regimen may be recommended to get in shape before the trip. It is important to check with your health-insurance provider to determine what is covered in the destination country. ''Travelers with ''diabetes'' may need to adjust their ''insulin''-dosing schedule if they cross several time zones.  Frequent monitoring of blood ''sugar'' (glucose) by ''finger stick'' is usually recommended. Remember to carry insulin in your carry-on baggage (otherwise it will freeze in the cargo hold). An identification bracelet showing that you have ''diabetes'' is also recommended. Carry a source of ''sugar'' in case your blood glucose drops. Remember that ''exercise'' may cause blood sugar to dip, so always carry your supplies on hikes, etc. Finally, keep up with your fluids. Hydration can help avoid complications if your blood sugar jumps. ''Travelers with ''heart disease'' should carry a recent ''electrocardiogram'' and a list of all current medications. Medications should be kept in carry-on luggage. If you have a ''pacemaker'', you should know the name of the company that made it and how to contact someone if it stops working. Travelers with unstable ''heart disease'' (unstable ''angina'', severe ''heart failure'', recent ''heart attack'', or unstable ''heart'' rhythm) should delay travel until their condition is stable. ''Travelers who have problems with their immune system due to active ''cancer'', ''chemotherapy'', or ''AIDS'' may encounter special problems. In general, vaccines made from live organisms are usually avoided in people with significantly impaired immune systems. Even non-live travel-appropriate vaccines may not work as well as usual, but they are still beneficial and should be given. Consider delaying travel until the immune system is back to normal, if this is possible. Consultation with a disease specialist and a travel-medicine specialist before departure is strongly recommended. ''''Blood clots'' may pose a risk to certain travelers, especially on long flights or periods of immobility. Discuss your risk with your doctor, and consider wearing compression or support stockings on your trip.''Travelers with disabilities should know that accommodations will vary widely between and within countries. The Department of Transportation can assist with getting accommodations on airplanes (1-800-778-4838). Service animals such as guide ''dogs'' are subject to quarantine regulations and may not be allowed to enter some countries. ''A broad array of special situations and common ''travel health'' topics are addressed by CDC (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/common-travel-health-topics).' "
What if I'm traveling while pregnant?,"'Pregnant women should consult with their obstetrician before travel. If available, a consultation with a travel medicine clinic is also recommended. Live vaccines are usually avoided in pregnancy. An up to date ''flu'' shot is safe and important, because flu can be very serious in pregnancy, and flu circulates at different times throughout the world. Some medications must also be avoided. This may put pregnant women at higher risk for getting sick in a foreign country. Blood clots are also more likely during pregnancy, especially with prolonged immobility and air travel.''Pregnant women should also be aware that the quality of obstetrical care in foreign countries varies considerably. It is best to have the name of a reputable clinic or hospital on hand. Women in the ''third trimester'' should consider delaying travel until after delivery. Check with your health-insurance provider in advance to determine what is covered in the destination country. You may want to purchase medical travel insurance with evacuation services (See ""Travel Health Insurance & Medical Evacuation Insurance"").''Diarrhea, some types of hepatitis, and malaria can be especially severe in pregnant women. Follow food, water, and insect precautions. Avoid areas with malaria if at all possible, and take medications as directed. ' "
What about traveling with children?,"'Children should be up to date on all routine vaccinations including those for ''mumps'', ''measles'', ''rubella'', polio, ''hepatitis B'', tetanus, ''diphtheria'', and ''varicella'' (''chickenpox''/''shingles'').  Some vaccinations and medications are not recommended for children. This means that the risk or severity of certain diseases is increased in children.''Diarrhea is more common in children because so much ends up in their mouths. Children can quickly become dehydrated. Make sure that your child drinks plenty of fluids. Consider adding an oral rehydration solution to your medical kit.''Children are attracted to animals and are more likely to get bitten. Bite wounds may become infected or transmit ''rabies''. Keep children away from animals.''Newborns and infants are at special risk because they are easily dehydrated and many vaccines and medications are contraindicated in this age group. Breastfeeding will help reduce the risk of diarrhea. There are limited options for malaria prevention in infants. Around the world, malaria remains one of the major ''causes of death'' in children. ' "
Travel health insurance & medical evacuation insurance,"'Most health insurance policies have very limited coverage outside the home country, and your portion of the cost may be much more than it would be at home. Some may not cover travel-related care at all, or not cover emergencies related to high-risk activities. You may also be more comfortable with familiar health care in familiar surroundings, and being seriously ill away from home and family may can add an unanticipated and heavy financial burden, as well as psychological ''stress''. Furthermore, most care will require up front cash or credit payment or not accept health insurance.'' If you have a chronic disease, immune deficiency, or are pregnant in the third trimester, it may be especially beneficial, but anyone traveling outside the continental U.S. may wish to consider purchasing short-term travel health or medical evacuation insurance. This type of coverage is usually inexpensive compared to the cost of an unexpected health emergency. Most out of country health emergencies are related to motor-vehicle accidents and ''trauma'', rather than health issues.''The U.S. Department of State can provide information on health care and medical emergencies when traveling abroad (http://www. travel.state.gov).'

What is travelers' diarrhea?,"""Travelers' diarrhea is defined by most experts as three or more unformed stools in a 24 hour time period, passed by a person who is traveling. Travelers' diarrhea is commonly accompanied by abdominal cramps, ""'nausea'', and ''bloating''. Travelers\' diarrhea is a general term and does not specify any cause. Travelers\' from temperate regions of the world frequently experience diarrhea four days to two weeks after arriving in certain other areas of the world. Other terms used to describe this illness include ""Montezuma\'s Revenge,"" the ""Aztec Two Step,"" and ""Turista"" in Mexico, the ""Delhi Belly"" in India, and the ""Hong Kong Dog"" in the Far East.' "
How common is travelers' diarrhea?,"'Twenty percent to 50 percent of international travelers may develop diarrhea depending on the region of the world they visit. Diarrhea is the most common illness of travelers, affecting 10 million people each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In general, travelers at risk for diarrhea commonly come from industrialized nations and travel to high-risk areas that are primarily within developing or less industrialized nations of the world, including Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Areas of lesser risk include China and some Caribbean nations. Travel to areas of the United States, Canada, Northern Europe, and Australia pose the lowest risk to travelers.'""Men and women are at equal risk for developing travelers' diarrhea. Younger individuals are more commonly afflicted, perhaps because of more adventurous eating habits. People with disorders that compromise their immune system (such as ""'HIV'', ''cancer'', ''chemotherapy'', steroid use), people with ''diabetes'', and people with underlying abdominal disorders (''irritable bowel syndrome'', ''colitis'"") are more susceptible to travelers' diarrhea. People taking acid blockers for their stomachs (for example, ""'famotidine'' [''Pepcid''], ''cimetidine'' [''Tagamet''], ''omeprazole'' [''Prilosec''], ''esomeprazole'' [''Nexium'""]) also have a higher susceptibility to travelers' diarrhea because they have less stomach acid to protect them from the bacteria that cause the condition."" "
What causes travelers' diarrhea?,"""Travelers' diarrhea usually is contracted by the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Contrary to common belief, food - not water - is the primary cause. The CDC estimates up to 80% of cases of travelers' diarrhea are caused by bacteria. The most common bacterium that causes travelers' diarrhea is enterotoxigenic ""'E. coli'','' one of six classes of enterovirulent ''E. coli''.''Most ''E. coli'' are harmless. However, there are six unique classes of ''E. coli'' that can cause inflammation of the stomach and bowels (''gastroenteritis'') and are termed enterovirulent. They are virulent (extremely noxious) to the intestine (or, in Greek, the enteron).''Collectively, these six classes of enterovirulent ''E. coli'' are referred to as the ''EEC'' group (enterovirulent ''E. coli''). Each class of EEC is distinct and different from the others.'""Other bacterial species implicated in travelers' diarrhea include""' Campylobacter jejuni'', ''Shigella'', and '' ''Salmonella''. Viruses (including ''Rotavirus'"", Norwalk virus and other enteric viruses) less commonly are causes of travelers' diarrhea. Parasitic infections are an uncommon cause with the exception of ""' ''Giardia lamblia'', which should be suspected in individuals traveling to Russia or to mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. ''Cryptosporidum'', another parasite, also has been implicated as a common cause of diarrhea in visitors to St. Petersburg, Russia and elsewhere.' Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) invades (passes into) the intestinal wall to produce severe diarrhea. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) is a type of EHEC, E.coli 0157:H7 that can cause bloody diarrhea and the hemolytic uremic syndrome (anemia and kidney failure). Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is the one that causes most of travelers' diarrhea, and produces a toxin that acts on the intestinal lining. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) can cause diarrhea outbreaks in newborn nurseries. Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) invade the epithelial cells causing diarrhea with mucus and blood. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAggEC) can cause acute and chronic (long lasting) diarrhea in children."
What are the symptoms of travelers' diarrhea?,"""The symptoms of travelers' diarrhea vary. Generally, diarrhea occurs within the first week of travel and lasts up to three to four days. Affected individuals on average pass up to five loose or watery bowel movements per day, which may be associated with cramps. On occasion, individuals may experience ""'fever'' or bloody stools. The diarrhea may be accompanied by ''abdominal pain'' and cramping, bloating, or increase in stomach or intestinal noises or gurgling (borborygmi).' "
How is travelers' diarrhea diagnosed?,"""The presumptive diagnosis of travelers' diarrhea is based solely on the development of diarrhea when visiting a part of the world where this condition is common among travelers.  The diarrhea usually is mild, self-limited, and resolves spontaneously. Symptoms usually can be controlled with over-the-counter medications  (see below.)  Only when the diarrhea is severe or complicated, and possibly when antibiotics are contemplated, should attempts be made to identify the exact organism responsible for the diarrhea so that the correct drug therapy can be selected.  Identification may be difficult or impossible in undeveloped countries because of the lack of medical laboratories. When laboratories are available, the ""'stool'' can be examined for parasites and cultured for bacteria. Identification of the pathogen results in the definitive diagnosis.' "
How is travelers' diarrhea treated?,"""Although prophylactic antibiotics (antibiotics taken before the person is exposed to the pathogen) are effective in preventing travelers' diarrhea, they generally are not recommended. The side effects of antibiotics, including ""'photosensitivity'' (sensitivity to the sun that results in injury to the skin) and additional diarrhea can be major problems. Antibiotic prophylaxis can be considered in individuals with underlying medical diseases in whom diarrhea is more likely to occur or who may be profoundly affected by the diarrhea. This group includes people with previous stomach surgery, active ''inflammatory bowel disease'', underlying immunodeficiency conditions, and other serious medical disorders. In these situations ''drugs'' of the quinolone class (''ciprofloxacin'' [''Cipro'', ''Cipro XR'', Proquin XR], ''levofloxacin'' [''Levaquin'']) have been shown to be effective.''Bismuth subsalicylate (''Pepto-Bismol'') in liquid or pill form also has been shown to be effective in preventing diarrhea in up to 65% of travelers although Pepto-Bismol may cause ''black stools'' and, rarely, ''ringing in the ears''. People ''allergic'' to ''aspirin'' should avoid Pepto-Bismol.''When treating afflicted individuals, drugs that alleviate symptoms as well as antibiotics play a role. With moderate symptoms, the addition of Pepto-Bismol alone may suffice. Alternatively, anti-diarrheal agents such as ''diphenoxylate and atropine'' (''Lomotil'') or ''loperamide'' (''Imodium'') can be given. With severe disease, characterized by frequent diarrhea or ''dehydration'', or complicated by the passage of bloody stools, Lomotil or Imodium should not be used and you should consult your doctor.''Oral fluids are a mainstay of therapy since they are important to prevent ''dehydration''. Tips for staying hydrated are:''Children and the elderly are more susceptible to dehydration. If a person feels light-headed or woozy, feels a rapid pulse or their mouth and lips are dry, they should consult a physician. If a child is listless, not eating or drinking and does not make wet diapers or urinate within a few hours, they also should be seen quickly by a doctor.'   Small, frequent sips of clear liquids (those you can see through) are the best way to stay hydrated. Avoid alcoholic, caffeinated, or sugary drinks, if possible. Over-the-counter rehydration products made for children such as Pedialyte and Rehydralyte are expensive but good to use if available. Sports drinks such as Gatorade and PowerAde are fine for adults if they are diluted with water because at full strength they contain too much sugar, which can worsen diarrhea. Try to drink at least as much or more fluid than you think is coming out or lost with the watery diarrhea. For mild to moderate dehydration, oral rehydration salts (ORS) may be recommended. These are available in pharmacies in most developing countries. Severe hydration usually requires emergent intravenous rehydration (IV). If the affected individual cannot hold down fluids, or is losing fluids faster than they can take them in, seek medical care immediately, because some patients will require IV hydration."
What is the prognosis for travelers' diarrhea?,"""The prognosis for travelers' diarrhea is usually good. Most cases resolve within 2 days without treatment. The CDC estimates 90% of cases resolve within one week, and 98% resolve within one month. Travelers' diarrhea is rarely fatal.  "" "
How can travelers' diarrhea be prevented?,"'Since food is the major source of infection, close attention to ''diet'"" is of foremost importance in the prevention of travelers' diarrhea. Foods should be well-cooked and served warm. Raw vegetables, uncooked meat or seafood, and other foods maintained at room temperature should be avoided. Dairy products, tap water and ice (including frozen drinks not made from filtered water) are also high-risk foods. Carbonated ""'beverages'', beer and wine, hot coffee and tea, fruits that can be peeled, and canned products generally are safe. The risk for developing diarrhea increases when eating at ''restaurants'"" and when purchasing food from street vendors.  Also, frequent hand washing with soap and clean water will decrease the likelihood of the bacteria's spread, especially to other people that the person may be traveling with. ""'Antibiotics can be effective in preventing travelers\' diarrhea, but are not recommended for most people due to possible side effects (see ""How is Travelers\' Diarrhea Treated?""). ''Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) also can be effective in preventing diarrhea in travelers although Pepto-Bismol may cause ''black stools'' and, rarely, ''ringing in the ears''. People allergic to aspirin should avoid Pepto-Bismol. Studies have not shown bismuth subsalicylate to be safe for use longer than three weeks. ''Probiotics'' such as ''Lactobacillus'' '""have shown inconclusive results in prevention of travelers' diarrhea."" "
What is Treacher Collins syndrome?,'Treacher Collins is a condition that affects the development of bones and other tissues in the face.' 
What are the signs and symptoms of Treacher Collins syndrome?,"'The signs and symptoms of this disorder vary greatly, ranging from almost unnoticeable to severe. Most individuals have:'""Some people with this condition are also born with an opening in the roof of the mouth called a cleft palate. In severe cases, underdevelopment of the facial bones may restrict an affected infant's airway, causing potentially life-threatening respiratory problems.""   underdeveloped facial bones, particularly the cheek bones, and A very small jaw and chin (micrognathia)."
What are the characteristics of Treacher Collins syndrome?," People with TCS often have eyes that slant downward, sparse eyelashes, and a notch in the lower eyelids called an eyelid coloboma. Some individuals have additional eye abnormalities that can lead to vision loss. It also characterized by absent, small, or unusually formed ears. Hearing loss occurs in about half of all individuals with the problem; hearing loss is caused by defects of the three small bones in the middle ear, which transmit sound, or by underdevelopment of the ear canal. People with Treacher Collins usually have normal intelligence."
How common is this syndrome?,"'Treacher Collins affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 people.' "
How do you get Treacher Collins (Causes)?,"'When Treacher Collins results from mutations in the TCOF1 or POLR1D gene, it is considered an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. About 60 percent of these cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In the remaining autosomal dominant cases, a person with TCS inherits the altered gene from an affected parent.''When TCS is caused by mutations in the POLR1C gene, the condition has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.' "
What genes are related to this syndrome?,"'Mutations in the TCOF1, POLR1C, or POLR1D gene can cause Treacher Collins. TCOF1 gene mutations are the most common cause of the disorder, accounting for 81 to 93 percent of all cases. POLR1C and POLR1D gene mutations cause an additional 2 percent of cases. In individuals without an identified mutation in one of these genes, the genetic cause of the condition is unknown.''The proteins produced from the TCOF1, POLR1C, and POLR1D genes all appear to play important roles in the early development of bones and other tissues of the face. These proteins are involved in the production of a molecule called ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a chemical cousin of DNA. Ribosomal RNA helps assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into new proteins, which is essential for the normal functioning and survival of cells. Mutations in the TCOF1, POLR1C, or POLR1D gene reduce the production of rRNA. Researchers speculate that a decrease in the amount of rRNA may trigger the self-destruction (apoptosis) of certain cells involved in the development of facial bones and tissues. The abnormal cell death could lead to the specific problems with facial development found in TCS. However, it is unclear why the effects of a reduction in rRNA are limited to facial development.' "
What are the treatment and management guidelines for this syndrome?,"'There is currently no cure for TCS. Treatment is tailored to the specific needs of each child or adult. Ideally, treatment is managed by a multidisciplinary team of craniofacial specialists.''Newborns may need special positioning or ''tracheostomy'' to manage the airway. Hearing loss may be treated with bone conduction amplification, speech therapy, and/or educational intervention.''There are some possible treatments that are being investigated. Researchers are looking for ways to inhibit a protein called p53, which helps the body to kill off unwanted cells. In people with TCS, p53 is abnormally activated, leading to the loss of specific cells and ultimately causing features of TCS. It has been proposed that inhibiting the production of p53 (or blocking its activation) may help to treat affected people. However, more research is needed to determine if this type of treatment is effective and safe.''Researchers are also studying the use of stems cells found in fat tissue to be used alongside surgery in people with TCS and other craniofacial disorders. Early studies have shown that surgical outcomes may be improved using these ''stem cells'' to help stimulate the regrowth of affected areas. However, this therapy is still experimental and controversial.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for a person with Treacher Collins syndrome?,"'Usually, people with TCS grow to become functioning adults with normal intelligence. With proper management, life expectancy is approximatelythe same as in the general population. In some cases, the prognosis depends on the specific symptoms and severity in the affected person. For example, very severe cases of TCS can cause perinatal death because of a compromised airway.' "

Exercise Stress Test Introduction,'A ''stress'' test can be used to test for ''heart disease''. ''Stress'' tests are tests performed by a doctor and/or trained technician to determine the amount of stress that your ''heart'' can manage before developing either an abnormal rhythm or evidence of ischemia (not enough blood flow to the heart muscle). The most commonly performed stress test is the ''exercise'' stress test.' 
What Is an Exercise Stress Test?,"'The ''exercise'' stress test -- also called a stress test, exercise ''electrocardiogram'', treadmill test, graded exercise test, or stress ''ECG'' -- is a test used to provide information about how the heart responds to exertion. It usually involves ''walking'' on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike at increasing levels of difficulty, while your electrocardiogram, heart rate, and ''blood pressure'' are monitored.' "
Why Do I Need a Stress Test?,'Your doctor uses the stress test to:' Determine if there is adequate blood flow to your heart during increasing levels of activity. Evaluate the effectiveness of your heart medications to control angina and ischemia. Determine the likelihood of having coronary heart disease and the need for further evaluation. Check the effectiveness of procedures done to improve blood flow within the heart vessels in people with coronary heart disease. Identify abnormal heart rhythms. Help you develop a safe exercise program.
What Types of Stress Tests Are There?,"'There are many different types of stress tests, including:''Preparation for these types of stress tests will vary from preparation for the exercise stress test. Ask your doctor about any specific instructions.' Dobutamine or Adenosine Stress Test: This test is used in people who are unable to exercise. A drug is given to make the heart respond as if the person were exercising. This way the doctor can still determine how the heart responds to stress, but no exercise is required. Stress echocardiogram: An 
echocardiogram (often called ""echo"") is a graphic outline of the heart's movement. A stress echo can accurately visualize the motion of the heart's walls and pumping action when the heart is stressed; it may reveal a lack of blood flow that isn't always apparent on other heart tests. Nuclear stress test: This test helps to determine which parts of the heart are healthy and function normally and which are not. A very small and harmless amount of radioactive substance is injected into the patient. Then the doctor uses a special camera to identify the rays emitted from the substance within the body; this produces clear pictures of the heart tissue on a monitor. These pictures are done both at rest and after exercise. Using this technique, a less than normal amount of thallium will be seen in those areas of the heart that have a decreased blood supply."
How Should I Prepare for the Exercise Stress Test?," Do not eat or drink anything except water for four hours before the test. Do not drink or eat foods containing caffeine for 12 hours before the test. Caffeine will interfere with the results of your test. Do not take the following heart medications on the day of your test unless your doctor tells you otherwise, or if the medication is needed to treat chest discomfort the day of the test: Isosorbide dinitrate (for example, Isordil, Dilatrate SR); Isosorbide mononitrate (for example, ISMO, Imdur, Monoket); Nitroglycerin (for example, Deponit, Nitrostat, Nitro-bid). Your doctor may also ask you to stop taking other heart medications on the day of your test. If you have any questions about your medications, ask your doctor. Do not discontinue any medication without first talking with your doctor. If you use an inhaler for your breathing, please bring it to the test."
What If I have Diabetes?," If you take insulin to control your blood sugar, ask your doctor what amount of your medication you should take the day of the test. Often, you will take only half of your usual morning dose and eat a light meal 4 hours before the test. If you take pills to control your blood sugar, do not take your medication until after the test is complete. Do not take your diabetes medication and skip a meal before the test. If you own a glucose monitor, bring it with you to check your blood sugar levels before and after your exercise stress test. If you think that your blood sugar is low, tell the lab personnel immediately. Plan to eat and take your blood sugar medication following your stress test."
What Should I Wear the Day of the Test?,"'On the day of your stress test, wear soft-soled shoes suitable for walking and comfortable clothes. Do not bring valuables.' "
What Happens During the Exercise Stress Test?,"'First, during a stress test, a technician will gently clean 10 small areas on your chest and place electrodes (small, flat, sticky patches) on these areas. The electrodes are attached to an electrocardiograph monitor (ECG or ''EKG'"") that charts your heart's electrical activity during the test.""'Before you start exercising, the technician will perform an EKG, to measure your heart rate at rest and will take your blood pressure.''You will begin to exercise by walking on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bicycle. The rate of exercise, or degree of difficulty will gradually increase. You will be asked to exercise until you feel exhausted.''At regular intervals, the lab personnel will ask how you are feeling. Please tell them if you feel chest, arm or ''jaw pain'' or discomfort, short of breath, dizzy, lightheaded, or any other unusual symptoms. It is normal for your heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and ''perspiration'' to increase during the test. The lab personnel will watch for any symptoms or changes on the ECG monitor that suggest the test should be stopped.''After the test you will walk or pedal slowly for a couple of minutes to cool down. Your heart rate, blood pressure and ECG will continue to be monitored until the levels begin returning to normal.''Although the appointment lasts about 60 minutes, the actual exercise time is usually between seven and 12 minutes.''Ask your doctor if you have any questions about the exercise stress test.'

"Do you have Asthma, Diabetes or Chronic Heart Disease?","'If so, you are at high risk of serious illness if you get the flu. In past flu seasons, as many as 80 percent of adults hospitalized from flu complications had a long-term health condition; as did about 50 percent of hospitalized children.''Asthma'', ''diabetes'' and chronic ''heart disease'' were the most common of these. This fact sheet provides information about treating influenza in high risk people with prescription influenza antiviral drugs. Treatment with an antiviral drug can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus a very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay.' "
Why am I at greater risk of serious flu complications?,"'Your medical condition makes it more likely that you will get complications from the flu, like ''pneumonia''. The flu also can make long-term health problems worse, even if they are well managed. People with asthma or chronic ''congestive heart failure'' may experience worsening of these conditions. ''Diabetes'' (type 1 and 2) can make the immune system less able to fight the flu. Also, illness can raise ''blood sugar'' levels.' "
Can the flu be treated?,"'Yes. There are prescription medications called ""antiviral drugs"" that can be used to treat influenza illness. Antiviral drugs fight influenza ''viruses'' in your body. They are different from antibiotics, which fight against ''bacterial infections''.' "
What should I do if I think I have the flu?,"'If you get the flu, antiviral drugs are a treatment option. Check with your doctor promptly if you have a high risk condition and you get ''flu symptoms''. Symptoms can include ''fever'', ''cough'', ''sore throat'', runny or stuffy nose, body ''aches'', ''headache'', ''chills'' and ''fatigue''. Your doctor may prescribe antiviral drugs to treat your flu illness.' "
Should I still get a flu vaccine?,"'Yes. Antiviral drugs are not a substitute for getting a ''flu vaccine''. While not 100% effective, a flu vaccine is the first and best way to prevent influenza. Antiviral drugs are a second line of defense to treat the flu if you get sick.' "
What are the benefits of antiviral drugs?," When used for treatment, antiviral drugs can lessen symptoms and shorten the time you are sick by
1 or 2 days. Antiviral drugs also can prevent serious flu-related complications (like pneumonia). This is especially important for people with a high-risk health condition like asthma, diabetes or chronic heart disease."
What are the possible side effects of antiviral drugs?,"'Some side effects have been associated with the use of influenza antiviral drugs, including ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', ''dizziness'', runny or stuffy nose, cough,''diarrhea'', ''headache'' and some behavioral side effects. These are uncommon. Your doctor can give you more information about these drugs or you can check the Centers for Disease Control and ''Prevention'' (CDC) or the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) websites.' "
When should antiviral drugs be taken for treatment?,"""Studies show that flu antiviral drugs work best for treatment when they are started within 2 days of gettingsick. However, starting them later can still be helpful, especially if the sick person has a high-risk healthcondition (see list below) or is very sick from the flu. Follow your doctor's instructions for taking this drug."" "
What antiviral drugs are recommended?,"'There are two antiviral drugs recommended by the CDC and approved by the FDA for flu treatment.These are oseltamivir (brand name Tamiflu®) and zanamivir (brand name Relenza®). Tamiflu® comes as apill or liquid, and Relenza® is an inhaled powder. (Relenza should NOT be used in anyone with breathingproblems, like asthma or ''COPD'', for example.) These drugs have been in use since 1999. There are nogeneric flu antiviral drugs.' "
How long should antiviral drugs be taken?,"'To treat flu, Tamiflu® and Relenza® are usually taken for 5 days, although people hospitalized with the flumay need the medicine for longer than 5 days.' "
Can children and pregnant women take antiviral drugs?,'Yes. Children and pregnant women can take antiviral drugs.' 
Who should take antiviral drugs?,"""It's very important that antiviral drugs be used early to treat the flu in:"" People who are very sick with the flu (for example, people who are in the hospital). People who are sick with the flu and have a high-risk health condition like asthma, diabetes or chronic
heart disease. (See below for full list of high risk conditions)."
What are the health and age factors that are known to increase a person's risk of getting serious complications from the flu?,"'''Other people at high risk from the flu:'' ' Asthma Blood disorders (such as sickle cell disease) Chronic lung disease (such as chronic obstructive

Surgery for anal cancer,"'Historically, all but the smallest anal ''cancers'' were treated with a radical surgery called abdominoperineal or AP resection, leading to a permanent end ''colostomy''. About 70% of patients survived more than 5 years in limited studies of this approach. This is no longer the primary ''anal cancer'' treatment of choice. ''Chemotherapy'' and ''radiation'' without radical surgery are now favored.''A limited resection of small stage I cancers can be curative for these small cancers of the anal margin or perianal skin when the anal sphincter is not involved. Radical resection today is reserved for some cases of residual or recurrent ''cancer'' in the anal canal after non-operative treatment. Other nonsurgical approaches (involving chemotherapy with a radiation boost or radioactive seed applications) may be used to avoid colostomy in those circumstances.' "
Radiation therapy for anal cancer,"'Radiation therapy'' alone for localized ''anal cancer'' may confer a greater than a 70% likelihood of 5-year survival. The high doses (high-energy) of radiation used (over 60 Gy [Gy is a unit of energy absorbed from ionizing radiation or 1 joule/Kg of matter.]) can lead to significant tissue damage and scarring, sometimes necessitating colostomy surgery for control and repair. This radiation treatment approach is not favored today. However, intensity-modulated radiation therapy where the radiation is shaped to treat only the ''cancer'' area is the most common type of radiation treatment for anal ''cancer''. In addition, proton therapy is being tested and may provide even better outcomes for some patients.' "
Combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy for anal cancer,"'Today the optimal primary therapy for stage I, II, IIIA, and IIIB anal cancers that are too large for potentially curative local resection is the combination of lower doses of radiation therapy (45 to 60 Gy) combined with the chemotherapy medicines, 5-FU and mitomycin C. The combination treatment results in 5-year colostomy free survival of over 75% of stage I, 65% of stage II, and 40% to 50% of stage 3 anal cancer cases. Anal cancers that are located in an area where they cannot be resected may benefit from combination therapy.''Salvage chemotherapy with an alternative regimen of the medicines 5-FU and cisplatin combined with a radiation boost can be used for follow-up of residual or recurrent local disease to avoid radical surgery. Radioactive seed implants can be used to establish local control for residual or recurrent disease to avoid radical surgery.' "
What are treatment options for stage IV anal cancer or metastasis?,"'Today there is no standard chemotherapy with curative potential for metastatic disease. Local symptom control, referred to as palliative care, is extremely important.''Rare patients with stage IV disease have truly localized metastatic disease for which surgery to remove the ''metastasis'' could theoretically be curative. This option should be considered in those unusual cases. The disease is rare enough that there are no studies specifically supporting or refuting this approach.''Patients with stage IV disease are excellent candidates for clinical ''research trials'' if they are well enough and give truly informed consent. A clinical trial is a research study investigating new approaches to treatment which may benefit the patient and help develop treatments for those patients who develop this disease in the future.''Thus, for most patients with stage IV disease the treatment options include:' Palliative surgery Palliative radiation therapy Palliative combined chemotherapy and radiation Clinical trials"
Is it possible to prevent anal cancer?,"'About 90% of anal ''squamous cell carcinoma'' occurs in patients with detectable evidence of ''human papillomavirus'' (''HPV'') infection.''Preventive steps of demonstrable benefit include:' Receive HPV vaccination Avoidance of high risk behaviors which increase the risk of or facilitate the acquisition of HPV infection such as having multiple sexual partners and engaging in receptive anal intercourse Perform anal pap testing in patients with a past history of carcinomas of the cervix (cervical cancer), vagina, or vulva (These increase the risk of anal cancer three-fold. Detection and treatment of precancerous lesions can reduce the risk that these patients will require treatment for anal cancer in the future.) Stop smoking, since smoking increases the risk of anal cancer Avoid high risk behaviors for the acquisition of HIV disease (Chronic immunosuppression in men who have sex with men increases the risk of anal cancer 30-fold.) Carefully monitor transplant recipients on immunosuppressant drugs with anal pap smears as discussed (Transplant recipients have a three-fold increased risk of anal cancer.)"
Where can one find information about clinical trials or research for anal cancer?,'There is ongoing research in the treatment of anal cancer. Visit ''ClinicalTrials.gov'' for information on clinical trials and patient eligibility.' 
What is cirrhosis of the liver?,"'Liver'' ''cirrhosis'' results from disease or chemical-induced injuries to the liver over a sustained period. As the injuries kill liver cells, your body attempts to rebuild the damage. In the process, the existing cells are inflamed and ''scar tissue'' results, compromising the structure of the liver and hampering its function. Your liver may become cirrhotic in response to a disease or toxins, such as alcohol. Sometimes cirrhosis results from a liver processing disorder or an autoimmune disorder that prompts the body’s defense mechanisms to attack the liver tissue. Treatment exists to slow the scarring and improve function, but in general, the scarring of liver cirrhosis is permanent.' "
What is the treatment for liver cirrhosis?,"'Treatment of cirrhosis is highly variable depending on the severity of the liver dysfunction and includes:' Preventing further damage to the liver Treating the complications of cirrhosis Preventing liver cancer or detecting it early Liver transplant Consuming a balanced diet and a multivitamin daily. Patients with PBC with impaired absorption of fat-soluble vitamins may need additional vitamins D and K. Avoiding drugs (including alcohol) that cause liver damage. All people with cirrhosis should avoid alcohol. Most of those with alcohol-induced cirrhosis experience an improvement in liver function with abstinence from alcohol. Even people with chronic hepatitis B and C can substantially reduce liver damage and slow the progression towards cirrhosis with abstinence from alcohol. Avoiding nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen or naproxen). Patients with cirrhosis can experience worsening of liver and kidney function with NSAIDs. Eradicating hepatitis C virus by using anti-viral medications. Not all patients with cirrhosis due to chronic viral hepatitis are candidates for drug treatment. Some patients may experience serious deterioration in liver function and/or intolerable side effects during treatment. Decisions to treat viral hepatitis have to be individualized, after consulting with doctors experienced in treating liver diseases (hepatologists). Removing blood from patients with hemochromatosis to reduce the levels of iron and prevent further damage to the liver. In Wilson disease, medications can be used to increase the excretion of copper in the urine to reduce the levels of copper in the body and prevent further damage to the liver. Suppressing the immune system with drugs such as prednisone and azathioprine (Imuran) to decrease inflammation of the liver in autoimmune hepatitis. Treating patients with PBC with a bile acid preparation, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), also called ursodiol (Actigall). Results of an analysis that combined the results from several clinical trials showed that UDCA increased survival among PBC patients during 4 years of therapy. The development of portal hypertension also was reduced by UDCA. Despite producing clear benefits, UDCA treatment primarily slows progression and does not cure PBC. Other medications such as colchicine (Colcrys) and methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall) also may have benefit in subsets of patients with PBC. Immunizing people with cirrhosis against infection with hepatitis A and B to prevent a serious deterioration in liver function. There are currently no vaccines available for immunizing against hepatitis C."
What type of doctor treats liver cirrhosis?,"'Hepatology is the study of ''liver disease'"", and a liver specialist or hepatologist will likely be part of your medical team in treating liver cirrhosis. Hepatology is a subspecialty of gastroenterology (GI doctor). The liver is the body's largest internal organ, and the study of hepatology includes the study of acute and chronic hepatitis, viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, genetic and metabolic liver diseases and their complications, liver ""'cancer'', liver transplantation, drug metabolism (which depends largely upon the liver), and immunology as it pertains to the liver.'

Facts you should know about hot flashes,"   Hot flashes are feelings of warmth that spread over the body and last from 30 seconds to a few minutes. Hot flashes may be accompanied by redness of the skin, known as flushing, and excessive sweating. Hot flashes are a characteristic symptom of the menopausal transition (perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopause) in women, but may occasionally result from other medical conditions. About 70% of women will experience hot flashes at some point in the menopausal transition. Hot flashes in men, young women, or during pregnancy may be due to medical conditions that interfere with the body’s ability regulate temperature. Hot flashes may be treated by hormone therapy or other medications if necessary. Natural home remedies for hot flashes have been proposed and may provide relief for some women; the effectiveness of other alternative treatments has not been adequately scientifically evaluated."
What are hot flashes?,"'A hot flash is a sensation of heat that begins in the head and neck regions. Hot flashes are a common symptom experienced by women prior to, and during the early stages of the menopausal transition. However, not all women approaching the ''menopause'' will develop hot flashes.' "
How long do hot flashes last?,"'Hot flashes are typically brief, lasting from about 30 seconds to a few minutes.'""The question of how long during a woman's lifetime that hot flashes last is a different one. Traditionally, it was believed that women only experienced hot flashes for a few years. More recent data suggest that many women may experience hot flashes for longer time periods. In a study from the University of Pennsylvania, the mean duration of hot flashes was 4.9 years, but up to a third of women continued to have hot flashes for up to 10 years. In the Study of Women Across the Nation (SWAN), women had hot flashes for an average of 7.4 years total and for an average of 4.5 years after the ""'last menstrual period''.' "
What causes hot flashes?,"'The complex hormonal changes that accompany the ''aging'' process, in particular the declining levels of estrogen as a woman approaches ''menopause'', are thought to be the underlying cause of hot flashes. A disorder in thermoregulation (methods the body uses to control and regulate body temperature) is responsible for the heat sensation, but the exact way in which the changing hormone levels affect thermoregulation is not fully understood.''Hot flashes are considered to be a characteristic symptom of the menopausal transition. They also occur in men and in circumstances other than the ''perimenopause'' in women (such as young women or during pregnancy) as a result of certain uncommon medical conditions that affect the process of thermoregulation. For example, the ''carcinoid syndrome'', which results from a type of endocrine ''tumor'' that secretes large amounts of the hormone serotonin can cause hot flashes. Hot flashes can also develop as a side effect of some medications and sometimes occur with severe infections or ''cancers'' that may be associated with ''fevers'' and/or ''night sweats''.'  "
What are signs and symptoms of hot flashes?,"'The timing of the onset of hot flashes in women approaching menopause is variable.'   Hot flashes are typically brief, lasting from about 30 seconds to a few minutes. Redness of the skin, known as flushing, may accompany hot flashes. Excessive perspiration (sweating) can also occur; when hot flashes occur during sleep they may be accompanied by night sweats. Feelings of anxiety may accompany hot flashes. Occasionally, palpitations (feelings of a racing heart beat) may occur during hot flashes. While not all women will experience hot flashes, many normally menstruating women will begin experiencing hot flashes even several years prior to the cessation of menstrual periods. It is impossible to predict if a woman will experience hot flashes, and if she does, when they will begin. About 40% to 85% of women experience hot flashes at some point in the menopausal transition."
How do medical professionals diagnose the cause of hot flashes?,"'Hot flashes are a symptom, not a medical condition. Taking a thorough medical history, the health-care professional will usually be able to determine whether a woman is having hot flashes. The patient will be asked to describe the hot flashes, including how often and when they occur, and if there are other associated symptoms. A physical examination together with the medical history can help determine the cause of the hot flashes and direct further testing if necessary.''Blood tests may be performed if the diagnosis is unclear, either to measure hormone levels or to look for signs of other conditions (such as infection) that could be responsible for the hot flashes.' "
What are the treatments for hot flashes?,"'There are a variety of treatments for hot flashes such as:''Some of these have not been tested by clinical studies, nor are they approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).'   hormone therapy, bioidentical hormone therapy, other drug treatments, complementary and alternative treatments, phytoestrogens, black cohosh, and alternative therapies."
Hormone therapy for hot flashes,"'Traditionally, hot flashes have been treated with either oral or transdermal (such as a patch) forms of estrogen. Hormone therapy (HT) or ''postmenopausal'' hormone therapy (PHT), formerly referred to as ''hormone replacement therapy'' (''HRT''), consists of ''estrogens'' alone or a combination of estrogens and ''progesterone'' (progestin). All available prescription estrogen medications, whether oral or transdermal, are effective in reducing the frequency of hot flashes and their severity. Research indicates that these medications decrease the frequency of hot flashes.''However, long-term studies (the NIH-sponsored '""Women's Health""' Initiative, or WHI) of women receiving combined hormone therapy with both estrogen and progesterone were halted when it was discovered that these women had an increased risk for ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''breast cancer'' when compared with women who did not receive hormone therapy. Later studies of women taking estrogen therapy alone showed that estrogen was associated with an increased risk for ''stroke'', but not for heart attack or ''breast cancer''. Estrogen therapy alone, however, is associated with an increased risk of developing ''endometrial cancer'' (''cancer'' of the lining of the uterus) in postmenopausal women who have not had their uterus surgically removed.''More recently, it has been noted that the negative effects associated with hormone therapy were described in older women who were years beyond menopause, and some researchers have suggested that these negative outcomes might be lessened or prevented if hormone therapy was given to younger women (prior to or around the age of menopause) instead of women years beyond menopause.'""The decision in regard to starting or continuing hormone therapy, therefore, is an individual one in which the patient and doctor must take into account the inherent risks and benefits of the treatment along with each woman's own medical history. It is currently recommended that if hormone therapy is used, it should be used at the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible time."" "
Bioidentical hormone therapy for hot flashes,"'There has been increasing interest in recent years in the use of so-called ""bioidentical"" hormone therapy for perimenopausal women. Bioidentical hormone preparations are medications that contain hormones that have the same chemical formula as those made naturally in the body. The hormones are created in a laboratory by altering compounds derived from naturally-occurring plant products. Some of these so-called bioidentical hormone preparations are U.S. FDA-approved and manufactured by drug companies, while others are made at special pharmacies called compounding pharmacies, which make the preparations on a case-by-case basis for each patient. These individual preparations are not regulated by the FDA, because compounded products are not standardized.''Advocates of bioidentical hormone therapy argue that the products, applied as creams or gels, are absorbed into the body in their active form without the need for ""first pass"" metabolism in the ''liver'', and that their use may avoid potentially dangerous side effects of synthetic hormones used in conventional hormone therapy. However, studies to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of these products have not been carried out.' "
Other prescription drug treatments for hot flashes," The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications have been shown be effective in reducing menopausal hot flashes. These drugs are generally used in the treatment of depression and anxiety as well as other condition. Paroxetine (Brisdelle) is an SSRI approved to treat moderate to severe hot flashes associated with menopause. Clonidine (Catapres) is an anti-hypertensive drug that can relieve hot flashes in some women. Clonidine is taken either by pill or skin patch and decreases blood pressure. Side effects of clonidine can include dry mouth, constipation, drowsiness, or difficulty sleeping. Gabapentin (Neurontin), a drug primarily used for the treatment of seizures, has also been effective in treating hot flashes. Megestrol acetate (Megace) is a progestin that is sometimes prescribed over a short-term to help relieve hot flashes, but this drug is not usually recommended as a first-line treatment for hot flashes. Serious side effects can occur if the medication is abruptly discontinued. Megestrol may have the side effect of weight gain. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) is another progestin drug and is administered by injection to treat hot flashes. It may lead to weight gain as well as bone loss."
What natural and home remedies treat hot flashes?,"'Some women report that ''exercise'' programs or relaxation methods have helped to control hot flashes, but controlled studies have failed to show a benefit of these practices in relieving the symptoms of hot flashes. Maintaining a cool ''sleep'' environment and the use of cotton bedclothes can help ease some of the discomfort associated with hot flashes and associated night sweats.''Many women turn to alternative therapies, including herbal products, ''vitamins'', plant estrogens, and other substances, for the treatment of hot flashes. Doctors can be reluctant to recommend alternative treatments because these nonprescription products are not regulated by the FDA (like prescription medications), and their ingredients and strength can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. For products that are not regulated by the FDA, testing and proof of safety is not required for marketing of these products. Long-term, scientifically controlled studies for these products are either lacking or have not proved the safely and effectiveness of many of the so-called natural or alternative remedies.''Some alternative treatments, however, have been evaluated in well-designed ''clinical trials''. Alternative treatments that have been scientifically studied with some research include phytoestrogens (plant estrogens, isoflavones), black cohosh, and ''vitamin E''.'  "
Black cohosh for hot flashes,"'Black cohosh is an herbal preparation that is becoming more and more popular in the U.S., and the North American Menopause Society does support the short-term use of black cohosh for treating menopausal symptoms, for a period of up to six months (because of its relatively low incidence of side effects when used over the short-term).''Some studies have shown that black cohosh can reduce hot flashes, but most of the studies have not been considered to be rigorous enough in their design to firmly prove any benefit. There also have not been scientific studies done to establish the long-term benefits and safety of this product. Research is ongoing to further determine the effectiveness and safety of black cohosh.' "
Soy and other plant sources for menopause symptoms,"'Isoflavones are chemical compounds found in ''soy'' and other plants (such as chick peas and lentils) that are phytoestrogens, or plant-derived estrogens. They have a chemical structure that is similar to the estrogens naturally produced by the body, but their effectiveness as an estrogen has been determined to be much lower than true estrogens.''Some studies have shown that these compounds may help relieve hot flashes and other ''symptoms of menopause''. In particular, women who have had ''breast cancer'' and do not want to take hormone therapy (HT) with estrogen sometimes use soy products for relief of menopausal symptoms. However, some phytoestrogens can actually have anti-estrogenic properties in certain situations, and the overall risks of these preparations have not yet been determined.''There is also a perception among many women that plant estrogens are ""natural"" and therefore safer than hormone therapy, but this has never been proven scientifically. Further research is needed to fully characterize the safety and potential risks of phytoestrogens.' "
"Other vitamins, herbs, and supplements","'There are many other ''supplements'' and substances that have been used as treatments for symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, including:''For more information, please read our ''Alternative Treatments for Hot Flashes'' article.''Scientific studies to prove the safety and effectiveness of these products in relieving hot flashes have not been adequately performed.' vitamin E, licorice, evening primrose oil, dong quai, chasteberry, and wild yam."
Which type of doctor treats hot flashes?,"'Many women will consult their gynecologist for the management of hot flashes associated with approaching menopause. Hot flashes are also treated by primary care providers, including internists and family practitioners. Hot flashes related to uncommon conditions, serious infections, or cancers are treated by the specialists treating the underlying condition.' "
Is it possible to prevent hot flashes?,"'While the development of hot flashes cannot be prevented, the treatment methods as described in the above section may be able to reduce their incidence and severity.' "
What is intertrigo?,"'Intertrigo'' is painful and ''itchy'' ''skin inflammation'' that occurs between skin folds, such as in the groin, buttocks, or between fat folds. Sometimes, bacteria can infect this irritated skin, worsening inflammation. Losing weight and applying various topical remedies – especially before gym workouts, jogging, or other exercises – can reduce the effects of ''intertrigo''.' "
What are home remedies and treatment for intertrigo?,"'Treatment of uncomplicated ''intertrigo'' primarily involves changing those environmental factors that have predisposed the patient to the condition. Areas of involvement are covered with a mild topical steroid like 1% hydrocortisone cream, which is available without a prescription, and then covered with zinc oxide paste or ointment (''Desitin'').' "
What kind of doctor treats intertrigo?,"'Intertrigo'' can be diagnosed by most doctors purely on the basis of its appearance -- a red ''rash'' affecting one or more intertriginous areas. If the condition does not respond to conventional treatments, then a referral should be made to a dermatologist.' "
What is anemia?,"'Anemia'' describes a condition in which you have a ''low red blood cell count'' and low ''hemoglobin'' levels. This is a serious condition as ''red blood cells'' and hemoglobin carry oxygen to all your cells, allowing them to burn energy. If you’re ''anemic'', you’ll likely feel fatigued and short of breath, lacking physical stamina. You may develop heart problems and appear pale. ''Anemia'' is often a symptom or consequence of some other disease or condition, so treatment varies widely depending on the root cause.' "
What is the treatment for anemia?,"'The treatment of the anemia varies greatly. First, the underlying cause of the anemia needs to be identified and corrected. For example, anemia as a result of blood loss from a ''stomach ulcer'' should begin with medications to heal the ulcer. Similarly, surgery is often necessary to remove a ''colon cancer'' that is causing chronic blood loss and anemia.''Sometimes ''iron supplements'' will also be needed to correct ''iron deficiency''. In severe anemia, blood transfusions may be necessary. Vitamin B12 injections will be necessary for patients suffering from ''pernicious anemia'', a name for ''vitamin B-12'' deficiency.''In certain patients with bone marrow disease (or bone marrow damage from ''chemotherapy'') or patients with ''kidney failure'', ''epoetin alfa'' (''Procrit'', ''Epogen'') may be used to stimulate bone marrow in red blood cell production.''If a medication is thought to be the culprit for anemia, then it should be discontinued under the direction of the prescribing doctor.' "
What specialty of doctor treats anemia?,'Anemia may be treated by internal or family medicine specialists as well as specialists in disorders of the blood (hematologists).' 
What are boils?,"'Boils result from a localized skin infection. They start as a hard, tender lump that reddens. Eventually, the lump becomes filled with whitish or yellow pus, which comprises millions of dead white blood cells the body has deployed to fight the infection, bacteria, and proteins. The boil or abscess may burst and drain by itself or may need surgical drainage (referred to as an incision and drainage or I&D).' "
What are home remedies for boils?,"'Home treatment is an option for most simple boils. Ideally, treatment should begin as soon as a boil is noticed since early treatment may prevent later complications.''The primary home remedy for most boils is heat application, usually with hot or warm water soaks or warm compresses. It may be necessary to apply them 20 minutes at a time for three to four times daily. Heat application increases the circulation to the area and allows the body to better fight off the infection by bringing antibodies and white blood cells to the site of infection.''If a boil occurs as a result of shaving, it is recommended to avoid shaving in that area until the boil has healed to avoid spread of bacteria.''As long as the boil is small and firm, opening the area and draining the boil is not helpful, even if the area is painful. However, once the boil becomes soft or ""forms a head"" (that is, a small pustule or area of pus is noted in the boil), it can be ready to drain (lance). Once drained, pain relief can be dramatic. Most small boils, such as those that form around hairs, drain on their own with hot soaks.' "
What is the treatment for boils?,"'On occasion, and especially with larger boils, medical treatment is required. In this situation, the boil will need to be drained or ""lanced"" by a health care professional. Frequently, these larger boils contain several pockets of pus that must be opened and drained.''Over-the-counter antibiotics are often used to eliminate any accompanying bacterial infection, especially if there is an infection of the surrounding skin. However, antibiotics are not needed in every situation. In fact, antibiotics have difficulty penetrating the outer wall of an abscess well and often will not cure an abscess without additional surgical drainage.''When an antibiotic is used, the choice depends upon the type of infection that is present as well as the results of tests to identify the precise bacteria that infect the area. Examples of drugs used in the treatment of boils include preparations of clindamycin (Cleocin and others), mupirocin (Bactroban), and cephalexin (Keflex).' "
What type of doctors treat boils?,"'Many boils resolve without specific treatment, but a dermatologist is a doctor commonly consulted for management of a boil. Other health care specialists who may treat boils include a primary care doctor, which may be a family practitioner, pediatrician, or internal-medicine doctors. With severe boils or spreading infection, an infectious-disease specialist or surgeon may be consulted. Emergency-medicine doctors may treat certain cases of severe infection caused by boils or abscesses.' "
What is diarrhea?,"'Diarrhea'' is characterized as loose or runny stools that happen an abnormally high number of times throughout the day. ''Diarrhea'' can be linked to autoimmune diseases like Crohn’s or functional bowel disorders like ''irritable bowel syndrome'', but is more often a sign of food intolerance (lactose is common), viral infection, ''food poisoning'' or other infectious diseases of varying severity. ''Diarrhea'' can be a serious problem in that it may cause ''dehydration'' and loss of nutrients. In people with chronic diarrhea, nutrient deficiency can be a serious issue.' "
What are the home remedies for diarrhea?,"'Many home remedies have been suggested for the treatment of diarrhea; however, few of them have been well studied. Three that have been studied and appear to be effective are:' Pectin Cooked green bananas Probiotics"
What is the treatment for diarrhea in infants and children?,"'Most acute diarrhea in infants and young children is due to viral ''gastroenteritis'' and is usually short-lived. Antibiotics are not routinely prescribed for viral gastroenteritis. However, ''fever'', ''vomiting'', and ''loose stools'' can be symptoms of other childhood infections such as ''otitis media'' (infection of the middle ear), ''pneumonia'', ''bladder infection'', ''sepsis'' (bacterial infection in the blood) and ''meningitis''. These illnesses may require early antibiotic treatment.''Infants with acute diarrhea also can quickly become severely dehydrated and therefore need early rehydration. For these reasons, sick infants with diarrhea should be evaluated by their pediatricians to identify and treat underlying infections as well as to provide instructions on the proper use of oral rehydration products.''Infants with moderate to severe ''dehydration'' usually are treated with intravenous fluids in the hospital. The pediatrician may decide to treat infants who are mildly dehydrated due to viral gastroenteritis at home with oral rehydration solutions.''Infants that are ''breastfed'' or ''formula-fed'' should continue to receive ''breast milk'' during the rehydration phase of their illness if not prevented by ''vomiting''. During, and for a short time after recovering from viral gastroenteritis, ''babies'' can be lactose intolerant due to a temporary deficiency of the enzyme, lactase (necessary to digest the lactose in milk) in the small intestine. Infants with ''lactose intolerance'' can develop worsening diarrhea and cramps when dairy products are introduced. Therefore, after rehydration with oral rehydration solutions, an undiluted lactose-free formula and diluted juices are recommended. Milk products can be gradually increased as the infant improves.' "
What is the treatment for diarrhea in adults?,"'During mild cases of diarrhea, diluted fruit juices, soft ''drinks'' containing ''sugar'', sports drinks such as Gatorade and water can be used to prevent dehydration. ''Caffeine'' and lactose-containing dairy products should be temporarily avoided since they can aggravate diarrhea. If there is no ''nausea'' and vomiting, solid foods should be continued. Foods that usually are well tolerated during a diarrheal illness include rice, cereal, bananas, and potatoes.''Oral rehydration solutions can be used for moderately severe diarrhea that is accompanied by dehydration in children older than 10 years of age and in adults. Directions on the solution label usually state the amounts that are appropriate. After rehydration, older children and adults should resume solid food as soon as any ''nausea'' and vomiting subside. Solid food should begin with rice, cereal, bananas, potatoes, and lactose-free and low-fat products. The variety of foods can be expanded as the diarrhea subsides.''Most episodes of diarrhea are acute and of short duration and do not require antibiotics. Antibiotics usually are not even necessary for the most common ''bacterial infections'' that cause diarrhea.''What medications treat diarrhea?''Antibiotics often are used when''Absorbents are compounds that absorb water in the small intestine and colon to make diarrheal stools less watery. They also may bind toxic chemicals produced by bacteria that cause the small intestine to secrete fluid; however, the importance of toxin binding in reducing diarrhea is unclear.''The two main absorbents are ''attapulgite'' (a naturally occurring complex mineral) and polycarbophil (a ''fiber'') both available without prescriptions. Psyllium, another absorbent has been used for mild diarrhea but is primarily used for ''constipation''.''Examples of products containing attapulgite are:''Examples of products containing polycarbophil are:''Products containing polycarbophil have been used to treat both diarrhea and ''constipation''. Attapulgite and polycarbophil remain in the intestine and, therefore, have no side effects outside of the gastrointestinal tract. They may occasionally cause ''constipation'' and ''bloating''. One concern is that absorbents also can bind medications and interfere with their absorption into the body, so it is recommended that medications and absorbents be taken several hours apart so that they are physically separated within the ''intestines''.''Anti-motility medications are ''drugs'' that relax the muscles of the small intestine and/or the colon. Relaxation results in slower flow of intestinal contents. Slower flow allows more time for water to be absorbed from the intestine and colon and reduces the water content of ''stool''. Cramps, due to spasm of the intestinal muscles, also are relieved by the muscular relaxation.''The two main anti-motility medications are ''loperamide'' (''Imodium''), which is available without a prescription, and diphenoxylate (''Lomotil''), which requires a prescription.''Both medications are related to opiates (for example, ''codeine'') but neither has the ''pain''-relieving effects of opiates.''Loperamide (Imodium), though related to opiates, when used as directed, does not cause ''addiction''.''Diphenoxylate is a man-made medication that at high doses can be addictive because of its opiate-like, euphoric (mood-elevating) effects. In order to prevent abuse of diphenoxylate and addiction, a second medication, ''atropine'', is added to loperamide in Lomotil. If too much Lomotil is ingested, unpleasant side effects from too much atropine will occur.''Loperamide and diphenoxylate are safe and well tolerated. There are some precautions, however, that should be observed.''Many bismuth-containing preparations are available around the world. Bismuth subsalicylate (''Pepto-Bismol'') is available in the US. It contains two potentially active ingredients, bismuth and salicylate (''aspirin''). It is not clear how effective bismuth compounds are, except in ''traveler'""'s diarrhea and the treatment of ""'H. pylori'' infection of the stomach where they have been shown to be effective. It also is not clear how bismuth subsalicylate might work. It is thought to have some antibiotic-like properties that affect bacteria that cause diarrhea. The salicylate is anti-inflammatory and could reduce secretion of water by reducing inflammation. Bismuth also might directly reduce the secretion of water by the intestine.''Pepto-Bismol is well tolerated. Minor side effects include darkening of the stool and tongue. Several precautions that should be observed when using Pepto-Bismol.' patients have more severe and persistent diarrhea, patients have additional debilitating diseases such as heart failure, lung disease, and AIDS, stool examination and testing discloses parasites, more serious bacterial infections (for example, Shigella), or C. difficile, and traveler's diarrhea. Donnagel Rheaban Kaopectate Advanced Formula Parepectolin Diasorb Equalactin Konsyl Daily Fiber Therapy Mitrolan Polycarb Anti-motility medications should not be used without a doctor's guidance to treat diarrhea caused by moderate or severe ulcerative colitis, C. difficile colitis, and intestinal infections by bacteria that invade the intestine (for example, Shigella). Their use may lead to more serious inflammation and prolong the infections. Diphenoxylate can cause drowsiness or dizziness, and caution should be used if driving or if tasks that require alertness and coordination are required. Anti-motility medications should not be used in children younger than two years of age. Most unimportant, acute diarrhea should improve within 72 hours. If symptoms do not improve or if they worsen, a doctor should be consulted before continuing treatment with anti-motility medications. Since it contains salicylate, a chemical related to aspirin (acetyl salicylate), patients who are allergic to aspirin should not take Pepto-Bismol. Pepto-Bismol should not be used with other aspirin-containing medications since too much aspirin may be ingested and lead to aspirin toxicity, the most common manifestation of which is ringing in the ears. The salicylate in Pepto-Bismol, similar to aspirin, can accentuate the effects of anticoagulants, particularly warfarin (Coumadin), and lead to excessive bleeding. It also may cause abnormal bleeding in people who have a tendency to bleed because of genetic disorders or underlying diseases, for example, cirrhosis. The salicylate in Pepto-Bismol can aggravate stomach and duodenal ulcer disease like asiprin. Pepto-Bismol and salicylate-containing products should not be given to children and teenagers with chickenpox, influenza, and other viral infections because they may cause Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a serious illness affecting primarily the liver and brain that can lead to liver failure and coma, with a mortality rate of at least 20%. Pepto-Bismol should not be given to infants and children younger than two years of age."
What kind of doctor treats diarrhea?,"'Most cases of diarrhea are treated by your primary care doctor (internist, pediatrician, family practitioner) or if you go to an emergency room and ''emergency medicine'' specialist. Gastroenterologists are the specialists who usually manage patients with complicated cases of diarrhea and pursue the diagnosis of its cause, particularly when the diarrhea is chronic.' "
What is snoring?,"'Snoring'' happens when tissues in the back of the throat vibrate as air passes over them during sleep. Nasal infections or deformities can cause ''snoring'', as can ''obesity'', drug or alcohol use, medications, ''smoking'', ''aging'' or sleep position.' "
What natural home remedies to stop snoring work?,"'Once you have ruled out ''sleep apnea'' as the cause of your snoring, the next step is figuring out how to stop snoring. There are some home remedies and behavior changes that may help reduce or eliminate snoring:'  Lose weight. Don't sleep on your back. Avoid alcohol. Don't take muscle relaxants (talk to your doctor before stopping any prescription medication, and ask about alternatives). Quit smoking. Try an anti-snoring pillow. Use nasal strips to open nasal passages. Take a hot shower before bed to open the sinuses. Change sheets frequently if allergies cause snoring (vacuum and dust regularly too.) Use a humidifier or vaporizer. Throat exercises Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)"
Do antisnoring apps work?,"'There are anti-snoring apps available. Download these anti-snoring solutions them onto your phone or tablet, to figure out ways to stop snoring. These apps can help record your snoring, analyze your sleep, and even play sound to awaken you when they detect a snore.' "
What medical treatments or surgeries stop snoring?,"'Medical treatments for snoring include assistive ''breathing'' devices such as the ''CPAP''.''Sometimes, surgery may be required to help people stop snoring. If snoring is due to a ''deviated septum'', ''nasal polyps'' or other nasal deformities, surgery can correct these problems. Surgery also can reduce bulky tissue in the throat or alter bone structure to reduce or cure your snoring. Types of surgery that may be performed to cure causes of snoring include:'  Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy to remove enlarged tonsils and/or adenoids. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) which thins and tightens tissue in the throat. Thermal ablation palatoplasty (TAP) uses radio waves to shrink throat tissues. Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) uses a laser to shorten the uvula. Palatal implants (also called the Pillar procedure) involves insertion of implants into the soft palate to help stiffen the soft tissue and reduce vibration. Somnoplasty uses radiofrequency heat energy to remove or stiffen tissues of the uvula and soft palate so they don't vibrate."
Which type of doctors treats snoring?,"""Many kinds of doctors treat snoring, depending on the underlying cause. You may first consult your primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner or internist, or a child's pediatrician. For further testing and management of snoring or ""'sleep disorders'' such as ''sleep apnea'' you may be referred to a sleep medicine specialist.''Allergies'' may be treated by an allergist, and ''asthma'' may be treated by a lung specialist (pulmonologist) or respiratory therapist. If you have nasal deformities such as a deviated septum or nasal polyps you may see an ear, nose, and throat specialist (ENT, or otolaryngologist), and if you require removal of your ''tonsils'' or adenoids you may be referred to a surgeon.''Sometimes an oral appliance is helpful to help stop the snoring. This may be fitted by a dentist.' "
What are bone spurs?,"'A bone spur is a small, sharp outgrowth of bone. They can come from local trauma to the bone, cartilage or tendon near where a bone spur has formed. Inflammation, like that caused by arthritis, can also cause the formation of bone spurs. Often, bone spurs are not painful or uncomfortable. They only require treatment when they start causing pain or discomfort.' "
What are home remedies for bone spurs?,'Home remedies to soothe the symptoms of bone spurs includes application of ice packs and taking over-the-counter pain medications like ibuprofen and other non-steroidal antiinflammatory medications.' 
What is the treatment for bone spurs?,"'Bone spurs are treated only if they are causing symptoms. Initial treatment is directed toward decreasing inflammation and avoiding reinjury when possible. Local cold application can help when the location of the bone spur is accessible. Anti-inflammatory medications, administered both orally (over-the-counter NSAIDs) and by local steroid injection (Kenalog, Depomedrol, Celestone), are commonly used, depending on the location of the spur. Local mechanical measures, such as orthotics, or shoe inserts, and local bone spur pads might be considered, depending on the location of the bone spur.''Bone spurs that are causing irritation of nerves, tendons or ligaments and that are resistant to conservative measures can require surgical operations for treatment.' "
What kind of doctor treats bone spurs?,"'An orthopaedic surgeon, a doctor who corrects congenital or functional abnormalities of the bones with surgery, casting, and bracing in cases of bone spurs. Podiatrists also treat bone spurs and other injuries to the foot and ankle.' "
What are hiccups?,"'The main muscle that helps your ''lungs'' expand and contract to breathe is the ''diaphragm'', which is in your abdomen and controls the volume of your chest cavity. ''Hiccups'' (also spelled hiccough) happen when this diaphragm ''muscle spasms''. In response, you vocal cords snap shut, causing the “hic” sound you hear with ''hiccups''. This condition is usually harmless and temporary, but prolonged cases may indicate some disease process or digestive problem that is causing the condition.' "
What are home remedies for hiccups?,"'There are numerous home cures for hiccups. You can try these methods at home to get rid of hiccups:''Methods that cause the body to retain carbon dioxide, which is thought to relax the diaphragm and stop the spasms, which cause the hiccups:''Techniques that stimulate the nasopharynx and the vagus nerve, which runs from the brain to the stomach, and can decrease hiccuping:' Hold your breath Drink a glass of water quickly Have someone frighten you Pull hard on your tongue Bite on a lemon Gargle with water Drink from the far side of a glass Use smelling salts Place one-half teaspoon of dry sugar on the back of your tongue. (This process can be repeated three times at two-minute intervals. Use corn syrup, not sugar, for young children.)"
What is the treatment for hiccups?,"'Most hiccups will stop on their own. Home remedies are generally sufficient to resolve hiccuping.''For persistent hiccups (lasting more than three hours), treatment varies, and you may need to contact your doctor.''A health-care professional may prescribe medications for severe, chronic hiccups. ''Chlorpromazine'' (''Thorazine'') is usually the first-line medication prescribed for hiccups.''Other medications used to treat hiccups include ''haloperidol'' (''Haldol'') and ''metoclopramide'' (''Reglan'').''Some muscle relaxants, ''sedatives'', analgesics, and even ''stimulants'' have also been reported to help alleviate hiccup symptoms.''Phrenic nerve surgery (the nerve that controls the diaphragm) is a treatment of last resort. This treatment rarely is performed and is used only in individuals with hiccups that do not respond to other treatments.' A ""hiccup bout"" is an episode of hiccups that lasts up to 48 hours ""Persistent hiccups"" continue more than 48 hours, up to one month ""Intractable hiccups"" last longer than one month"
What kind of doctor treats hiccups?,"'Hiccups generally go away on their own and do not require medical treatment, however, if hiccups last more than three hours or disturb eating or sleeping, you may see your primary care provider (PCP) such as a family practitioner, internist, or a child’s pediatrician.''There may be many different specialists who treat hiccups depending on the underlying cause, for example:' If the cause is a stroke or other neurological disorder, you may see a neurologist, a specialist in the nervous system and brain. If the cause is acid reflux, you may see a gastroenterologist, a specialist in disorders of the digestive system. If the cause is lung disease or pneumonia, you may see a pulmonologist, a specialist in disorders of the respiratory tract."
What is breast cancer staging?,"'The stage of a ''cancer'' refers to the extent to which it has spread within the body at the time of diagnosis. Staging of ''cancers'' is typically done using a variety of tests and imaging studies to look for the extent of the ''cancer''. To accurately determine the stage of a ''tumor'', doctors look at the size of the ''tumor'', the degree to which it has spread to nearby tissues, and the degree to which it has spread via the bloodstream to other organs or via the lymphatic vessels to the ''lymph nodes''.''Breast cancer'' stages are divided into four broad groups: I, II, III, and IV. Within each of these four groups are several different subgroups. Ductal ''carcinoma in situ'' (DCIS) is a regarded as a very early form of ''breast cancer'' in which the abnormal cells have not begun to invade outside of the breast ducts; DCIS is sometimes referred to as stage 0 ''cancer''. This article will focus on the treatment of invasive ''breast cancer'' in stages I-IV.' "
What is the treatment for stage I breast cancer?,"'Stage I breast cancers are small and have not spread to the ''lymph nodes'' or have spread to the lymph nodes only in a tiny area. While this is an early stage of ''breast cancer'', there is a risk of such cancers recurring if not treated effectively.''Surgery'' is the standard treatment for early-stage breast cancers. Both breast-conserving surgery (BCS; also referred to as ''lumpectomy'' or partial ''mastectomy'') or ''mastectomy'' may be performed, depending upon many factors, including both location of the tumor and patient preference. The lymph nodes will also be evaluated to make certain there is no spread to these areas. This can be done by either a ''sentinel lymph node biopsy'' (looking at the ''lymph node'' most likely to be the site of tumor spread) or an axillary ''lymph node'' dissection. ''Breast reconstruction'' surgery can be done either at the same time as the ''cancer'' surgery or later on.''When BCS is performed, it is most commonly followed by ''radiation therapy'' to help reduce the risk of the ''cancer'' coming back (recurring). In women over 70 years of age who have small tumors that have not spread to the lymph nodes, ''radiation therapy'' may not always be given if the tumor has been shown to express hormone receptors and ''hormone therapy'' is given.''Any additional therapy intended to improve the likelihood that the ''cancer'' will never recur is called an adjuvant therapy. Such treatment depends upon the characteristics of the tumor. If the tumor expresses hormone receptors (''estrogen'', ''progesterone''), it is said to be hormone-sensitive or hormone receptor-positive. This means that hormones stimulate growth of the cancer cells, and ''hormone therapy'"" is recommended. The goal of hormone therapy is to block the body's ability to make hormones or to interfere with the activity of hormones.""'Two different kinds of hormone therapy may be given. ''Tamoxifen'' (''Nolvadex'') is a commonly used drug of the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) class. These ''drugs'' bind to estrogen receptors, preventing estrogen from binding. ''Tamoxifen'' is typically prescribed for premenopausal women (and men) who have estrogen receptor-positive ''breast cancer''. Tamoxifen therapy is given for five to 10 years. Another drug class used for ''breast cancer'' hormone therapy is the aromatase inhibitors (AI). These further reduce levels of estrogen by blocking the conversion of adrenal hormones to estrogen through the process of aromatization in the fat. Women who are ''postmenopausal'' will usually receive adjuvant hormone therapy with an aromatase inhibitor, like ''anastrozole'' (''Arimidex''), ''letrozole'' (''Femara''), or ''exemestane'' (''Aromasin''). Women who become ''postmenopausal'' during tamoxifen treatment may be switched to an aromatase inhibitor. Because women may stop having periods on tamoxifen, blood tests to measure hormone levels are often needed to determine whether ''menopause'' has occurred. Another option for premenopausal women, instead of tamoxifen, is taking a medication to suppress activity of the ovaries along with an AI. Bisphosphonates are a drug class that can help reduce bone loss and ''fractures'' as well as improves survival in women taking AIs for breast cancer.''Hormone therapy is one type of adjuvant therapy. ''Chemotherapy'' is another type of adjuvant therapy. For early-stage breast cancers, including stage I tumors, ''chemotherapy'' is sometimes recommended. Chemotherapy is usually recommended if the tumor is hormone receptor-negative or is HER2-positive (see below). Chemotherapy may also be recommended for an estrogen-receptor-positive tumor if the tumor is large or has an unfavorable result on a genomic profiling assay such as the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay. Chemotherapy is usually given for a period of three to six months depending upon the exact regimen selected.''Tumors that overexpress the HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) receptor are generally treated with ''adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy''. HER2 is a normal protein that helps normal breast cells grow and divide. However, in certain breast cancers, there are too many copies of the HER2 gene, leading to overexpression of the protein and uncontrolled cell growth. These are called HER2-positive cancers. ''Trastuzumab'' (''Herceptin'') is an example of an anti-HER2 drug that binds to the HER2 receptors and blocks their reception of growth signals.' "
What is the treatment for stage II breast cancer?,"'Stage II breast cancer,\xa0but the risk that the cancer can recur is higher than in stage I. is also considered to be early stage breast cancer. Stage II cancers are larger than stage I tumors or have spread to a few nearby lymph nodes.''Surgery'' is also indicated to remove stage II breast cancers. Both breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy may be considered, depending on the size and location of the tumor and patient preferences. As with stage I tumors, lymph node status (whether or not the cancer has spread to lymph nodes) will be assessed. Women who received BCS or had larger tumor (over 5 cm) are typically then given ''radiation'' therapy'' as well.''Women with larger stage II tumors may be considered for ''neoadjuvant therapy''. Unlike adjuvant therapies, which are given after surgery, neoadjuvant therapies are given before surgery. Hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and HER2-targeted therapies can all be given as neoadjuvant therapy. Typically, the reason that neoadjuvant therapy is given is to shrink the tumor prior to surgery so that less extensive surgery can be performed. Neoadjuvant therapies can shrink tumors, but they do not improve overall survival rates when compared to giving the therapies after surgery. Hormone therapy started as neoadjuvant therapy should be continued after surgery.''Types of adjuvant therapy for stage II breast cancer include ''hormone therapy'', ''chemotherapy'', and ''HER2-targeted therapy''. The same considerations apply for choosing the appropriate adjuvant therapy as outlined above under stage I tumors. Sometimes more than one adjuvant therapy is recommended, such as a combination of hormone therapy and chemotherapy, or a combination of chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy. Other ''drugs'' that may be used for HER2-positive breast cancers include pertuzumab (Perjeta) and lapatinib (Tykerb).' "
What is the treatment for stage III breast cancer?,"'Stage III breast cancers are larger (5 cm across or more), have spread into local tissues like the skin or muscle, or have spread to 10 or more nearby lymph nodes. The risk of recurrence of these cancers is high, but a cure remains possible.''Often, stage III breast cancers are treated with some kind of ''neoadjuvant therapy'' to shrink the tumors prior to ''surgery''. If the tumor size can be significantly reduced, BCS may still be an option. If neoadjuvant therapy is not given or if the tumor has spread to nearby tissues, mastectomy is typically the procedure of choice. An axillary lymph node dissection is often performed to evaluate the lymph nodes, although for some patients a ''sentinel lymph node biopsy'' may be an option. ''Radiation therapy'' is recommended after surgery for patients with stage III tumors.''Adjuvant therapy is also given. The type of adjuvant therapy depends upon the characteristics of the tumor as described previously and can include ''hormone therapy'', ''chemotherapy'', ''HER2-targeted therapy'', or a combination of these.' "
What is the treatment for stage IV breast cancer?,"'Stage IV breast cancers have spread to other sites in the body and are referred to as metastatic breast cancers. Today, save in anecdotal instances, these cancers are incurable.''Common sites to which tumors may have spread include the ''lungs'', ''liver'', and bones. ''Hormone therapy'', ''chemotherapy'', and ''HER2-targeted therapies'' (depending upon the characteristics of the tumor) are the mainstay of therapy. Surgery is generally not done except in special situations, such as relieving compression on the spinal cord, treating a small number of metastases in one area, or treating brain metastases in certain situations. ''Radiation'' therapy may also be used in certain situations for symptom relief or treating certain areas of metastatic tumor.''Hormone therapy is often the first treatment for stage IV cancers that are hormone receptor-positive, but since this may take some time to work, chemotherapy may be given first if there are severe symptoms. Switching to different types of hormone therapy or chemotherapy than originally received may be indicated. Likewise, additional HER2-targeted drugs may be given to patients with stage IV breast cancers that are HER2-positive.''Clinical trials'' to test new combinations of drugs or new drugs are another treatment option.' "
How is scarlet fever treated?,"'The main goal of treating ''scarlet fever'' is to relieve the ''fever'' and ''itching'' as it causes discomfort to the patient. The treatment goal also includes reducing the spread of the disease.\xa0''As ''scarlet fever'' is caused by bacteria, once the infection is confirmed, a course of antibiotics may be prescribed, usually\xa0''penicillin'', for up to 10 days. In some situations, a single dose of penicillin may be given by intramuscular injection. Patients ''allergic'' to penicillin may be treated with an alternative antibiotic, such as\xa0''erythromycin''.''Other common treatments include:''Home remedies:' Paracetamol when necessary for fever, headache, or throat pain. Eating soft foods and drinking plenty of cool liquids, particularly if the throat is very painful. Oral antihistamines and emollients to relieve the itch of rash. Fingernails may be required to be short on young children to prevent them from damaging the skin due to itching. The fever usually improves within 12-24 hours after starting antibiotics and most patients recover after 4-5 days with the clearing of a rash over several weeks. Provide adequate fluids and rest to the patient for at least two weeks Gargling with lukewarm water and salt Humidify the air Maintaining a soft and healthy diet Avoiding smoke exposure"
What are the common symptoms of scarlet fever?,"'Scarlet fever is a bacterial infection. The distinctive feature of scarlet fever is a ''sore throat'' followed by a rash\xa0made up of tiny pinkish-red spots that cover the whole body. Scarlet fever occurs mostly in children. The symptoms include:' A Sore throat that may show white or yellow patches when examined Fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, often with chills A whitish coating on the surface of the tongue. The tongue may look like a strawberry. A rash first appeared as tiny red bumps on the chest and abdomen. The rash may then spread over the body, lasting about two to five days. After the rash, often the skin on the tips of the fingers and toes will peel. Flushed face with a pale area around the lips. Swollen glands in the neck. Weakness Headache"
What are the causes of scarlet fever?,"'The cause of scarlet fever is an infection with group A streptococci (''group A strep'') bacteria. During the infection, it can produce an erythrogenic (producing a red-colored) toxin. This toxin is responsible for causing the sandpaper-like red-colored skin rash and fever:' The infection is often passed among classmates at school or among the family members. It's most often spread by droplet contact. The droplets are emitted when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can also spread if a person touches a plate or glass on which these droplets have landed. The bacteria usually infect the throat (‘strep throat’) or skin (‘school sores’). The bacteria then release toxins that cause swelling of the skin and lead to the development of the rash. This bacterium is usually found in the saliva and mucus of an infected person. When they cough, sneeze or talk, small droplets containing the bacteria are spread through the air and maybe breathed in by nearby people.  Only a very small number of people infected with group A strep will develop scarlet fever.  If an individual develops scarlet fever, it usually takes 2-5 days for the symptoms to start after infection. Scarlet fever can also be seen after the burns or wounds are infected."
What are the complications of scarlet fever?,"'If scarlet fever is left untreated or treatment is unsuccessful, the following complications may arise:' Rheumatic fever: This affects the heart and kidneys. This may also permanently damage the body and require long-term treatment. Ear infections  Adenitis or throat abscesses Inflammation and infections of the sinuses (sinusitis) Kidney infections Lung infections (pneumonia) Death"
How can we prevent scarlet fever?,"'The only way to prevent scarlet fever is by washing hands and maintains hygiene. It may be recommended not to share plates or utensils with other people, especially in schools and hostels. The best practice that may be followed is that people should cover their nose and mouth with a mask.' "
What is multiple sclerosis (MS)?," Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks myelinated axons in the brain and spinal cord nerve fibers (central nervous system), damaging or destroying the myelin (demyelination) and/or the axons (nerve tissue). Sclerosis means abnormal hardening or thickening of tissue, often due to inflammation. Myelin is a fatty substance that covers, surrounds, and protects the nerves. Think of myelin as a conduit in an electrical system that ensures messages sent by axons (nerve fibers) are not lost en route. MS often progresses slowly over many years (about 25 years). Multiple sclerosis is most commonly diagnosed in females ages 20 to 40 but may occur at any age and both genders. Usually, multiple sclerosis in children and teens (pediatric MS) goes undiagnosed; however, medical professionals have diagnosed about 8,000 to 10,000 children and teens in the United States with the disease. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis in children, teens, and adults may have common symptoms or similar first symptoms, for example:WeaknessFatigueTinglingBlurred visionPain Weakness Fatigue Tingling Blurred vision Pain Other symptoms and signs of MS in children and teens include seizures and/or mental status changes like lethargy. People with MS often suffer intermittent attacks followed by periods of symptom remissions. Due to the intermittent nature and variety of symptoms, MS can often be a challenging diagnosis for health care providers. MS attacks can last for days or months at a time followed by remissions; some individuals however, may continue to get worse without periods of remission."
At what age does multiple sclerosis start?,"'The early signs and early ''symptoms of multiple sclerosis'' usually begin between the ages of 20 and 40 years old. However, it is possible to have MS begin in childhood (termed pediatric MS, which includes infancy to 18) or over 40 years of age, but it occurs less frequently in these age groups. Only about 2%-5% of all people diagnosed with MS (MS patients or MSers) have symptoms before age 18. ''Multiple sclerosis'' in children and teens is difficult to diagnose, so its true frequency of occurrence is only estimated. In some MS patients, there is evidence that infection with the ''Epstein-Barr virus'' may help trigger MS disease.' "
Does multiple sclerosis cause pain?,"'About two-thirds of people with MS report ''pain'' as a symptom of their disease. The most common types of ''pain'' experienced by people with MS are ''headache'', ''back pain'', extremity ''pain'', and ''muscle spasms''. Because the pain comes from the nerves, common pain medicines like ''aspirin'' have little or no effect; however, other medications may be effective. Lhermitte\'s sign is sometimes experienced by MS patients; it\'s a sharp ""electrical"" sensation that occurs in the back and into the limbs and/or runs up and down the spine (spinal cord) when the head is bent forward.' "
5 early signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis,"'Because the autoimmune inflammatory response may attack some of the myelinated axons in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) almost anywhere, the location (and severity) of each attack can be different. Consequently, the symptoms of an MS attack may be quite variable from patient to patient and can appear almost anywhere in the body. The usual first sign and symptom is often a change in sensory perception (paresthesias) almost anywhere in the body. Other early common symptoms include the following:''Because of the highly variable symptoms, this is a disease that is difficult to diagnose when symptoms first appear. The rest of the article will present symptoms that arise from various parts of the body that can be due to MS. Unfortunately, many of the symptoms described can occur in other disease processes so it is important to have a diagnosis of MS in part by ruling out other conditions.''The diagnosis of MS usually involves a ''neurologist'' who will take your medical history, do blood tests, tests to measure electrical activity in the brain and other areas, an ''MRI'', and an analysis of spinal cord fluid. Tests may be done to distinguish MS from ''stroke'', thyroid-caused illness, or other debilitating diseases that cause similar symptoms to MS.'

"Numbness, tingling, and pain","'As previously mentioned, individuals with MS have variable symptoms so symptoms described above are generalized symptoms. It is likely that a person with ''multiple sclerosis'' may show initial symptoms in one or two of these major categories in the early development of MS; other symptoms may or may not appear later in the disease process. However, MS is a slowly progressive disease for which there is no known cure. The goal of treatment is to reduce and/or control symptoms and prevent relapse.'

What are the treatment guidelines for MS symptoms?,'Multiple sclerosis'' is a slowly progressive disease for which there is no known cure. The goal of treatment is to reduce and/or control symptoms and prevent relapses. Treatment of multiple sclerosis has two major areas that are used to reduce and/or control symptoms and prevent relapses. The first area for controlling symptoms is to treat the underlying immune system disorder of MS; the second area is designed to reduce and/or treat ''MS symptoms'' and relapses. Primary caregivers usually seek medical advice from neurologists for treatment protocols.' 
List of first line drugs to treat MS symptoms,"'Although the underlying or triggering mechanism for MS and for MS relapses is unknown, several ''drugs'' have been shown to have beneficial effects in people with ''MS symptoms'' including reducing the frequency and severity of clinical MS attacks. These ''drugs'' act on the immune system by modulating its response, and such agents have been approved for use for treatment. These agents include''These drugs often have side effects and are usually prescribed by physicians experienced in treating people with MS. Plasmapheresis (a method to remove autoantibodies from the blood) is another technique used to reduce the autoimmune problems in certain people with MS.''The FDA recently approved the drug ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) to treat adult patients medically who have relapsing-remitting MS and for MS type, primary progressive MS (PPMS). This is the first drug the FDA approved for PPMS and is administered by intravenous infusion.

People with clinically isolated syndrome not take cladribine.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat multiple sclerosis?,"'A neurologist administers the primary treatment of patients with MS. Additional consultation with specialists is often recommended; for example, individuals with cognitive problems may be helped by a neuropsychologist and/or a psychiatrist while those with symptoms related to the bowel or bladder may be best served by consultation with a ''gastroenterologist'' or ''urologist''. Individuals with advanced MS with multiple problems may require (in addition to physician specialists who manage disease-modifying medications) a social worker specialist to manage the intense every day care required for a person with multiple MS symptoms. Some patients with debilitating ''multiple sclerosis symptoms'' and poor health may require a live-in ''caregiver''.''Treatment for multiple sclerosis in children and teens is by pediatric specialists with experience in pediatric MS.''For additional information about MS, contact the Multiple Sclerosis Society and/or the MS International Federation.' "
What treatments are used in patients with PBC?,'The treatments used in patients with PBC can be subdivided into:' Medications to treat PBC itself Treatments for the symptoms of PBC Treatments for the complications of PBC Treatments for the diseases associated with PBC Medications to increase bile flow from the liver Liver transplantation
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA),"'The destruction of bile ducts in PBC leads to the retention of certain toxic bile acids in the liver cells (hepatocytes). These toxic bile acids are believed to cause death of the hepatocytes and a gradual loss of ''liver function''. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA is an abbreviation for this chemical name) is a naturally occurring bile acid that is produced in small quantities by normal hepatocytes. UDCA is available to prescribe as ''ursodiol'' (Urso-250, Actigal, and generic preparations). When taken orally, UCDA is absorbed from the gut, taken up and processed by hepatocytes, and transported in bile back to the intestine. UDCA has at least four beneficial effects in PBC:''Four large-scale, ''clinical trials'' have compared the effectiveness and safety of UDCA to that of an inactive drug (a placebo). These controlled trials were done in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a spectrum of tissue abnormalities (pathology) on their liver biopsies, ranging from early disease to cirrhosis. UDCA treatment led to improvement in liver blood test abnormalities, significantly reducing elevated levels of ''bilirubin'', ''alkaline phosphatase'', gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and cholesterol. UDCA, however, did not improve ''fatigue'' or prevent or improve ''osteoporosis'', and had a variable effect on itching. Three of the four trials used a similar dose of UDCA (13-15 mg per kg body weight per day) and were combined for an analysis of a total of 548 patients.''The results of the combined analysis showed that UDCA significantly increased survival after up to 4 years of therapy, without the need for liver transplantation. The fourth large-scale study used a lower dose of UDCA (10 to 12 mg per kg per day). The results of this study differed somewhat from those of the other three studies. This one showed a benefit of UDCA treatment primarily in patients with bilirubin levels of less than 2 mg/dL. The three other studies, analyzed alone or combined, however, did not confirm this observation about the bilirubin. In fact, each of those studies actually demonstrated a benefit for patients with advanced disease and elevated bilirubin levels. Furthermore, the development of ''portal hypertension'' was reduced by the UDCA. It is important to note that despite producing clear benefits, UDCA treatment primarily '' retards'' progression and does not cure PBC.''All patients with PBC who have ''abnormal liver tests'', regardless of the stage of the liver biopsy or the phase of natural progression of the disease, probably should be treated with UDCA. The dose usually should be between 13 and 15 mg per kg body weight per day. Patients can take UDCA as either a single dose or a divided dose without affecting its clinical benefits. UDCA is very safe for long-term use. The primary side effect is ''diarrhea'', which is due to failure to absorb all of the UDCA from the gut. Patients who experience ''diarrhea'' can take smaller doses more frequently, trying to maintain the recommended total daily dose. On the other hand, patients who do not have ''diarrhea'' can try taking larger amounts per dose, with the goal of taking only one dose (again, the recommended total dose) per day at bedtime.' First, it increases the rate of bile flow from the hepatocytes, thereby combating cholestasis and diluting toxic bile acids in bile. Second, it inhibits the body's production of toxic bile acids, thereby preventing further injury to the hepatocytes. Third, it inhibits apoptosis (genetically programmed cell death), thereby preventing hepatocytes from dying. Fourth, it mildly inhibits the immune response in the liver, thereby possibly reducing immunological injury to the bile ducts and liver."
Colchicine (Colcrys),"'Colchicine, a drug that reduces inflammation and scarring, has been used primarily to treat ''arthritis'' caused by ''gout''. Three randomized, controlled trials in PBC showed that colchicine, compared to placebo, modestly slowed progression of abnormal blood tests, but did not reduce symptoms or prevent progression of liver pathology (tissue abnormalities on the biopsy). One of the trials actually suggested that colchicine improved survival. This impression of better survival with colchicine, however, has not been substantiated. In fact, the seemingly improved survival appears to be due to an unexpectedly high death rate (mortality) among the patients receiving the inactive drug in that study. The benefits of colchicine are so small that it is rarely recommended.' "
Immunosuppressive medications,"'Immunosuppressive medications, for example, corticosteroids, ''azathioprine'', ''cyclosporine'' (''Sandimmune'', ''Neoral'', ''Gengraf''), and ''methotrexate'' (''Rheumatrex'', ''Trexall'') suppress immune reactions. These medications are theoretically attractive agents to treat PBC, based on the concept that it is an autoimmune disease. Several randomized controlled studies have tested immunosuppressive ''drugs'' in PBC. However, none of these studies has demonstrated prolonged survival of patients.' "
Corticosteroids,"'Corticosteroids, for example,''prednisone'', ''prednisolone'', and ''budesonide'' (Entocort) inhibit the initiation of immune responses, including those initial responses required for '' perpetuation'' of autoimmunity reactions. A randomized (treatment assigned by chance) controlled trial was carried out comparing a placebo with a low dose of prednisolone over a 3-year period. This study showed that prednisolone improved liver function and did not significantly increase the rate of bone thinning or demineralization. (''Osteoporosis'' is a potential side effect of steroids). Another randomized trial compared UDCA and placebo with UDCA and prednisolone in patients with early stages of PBC. Although improvement in liver function was similar for both groups, only the combination of UDCA and prednisolone resulted in markedly improved liver biopsies.''It is noteworthy that the principal benefits of corticosteroids were seen in patients with '' early'' stages of the disease on liver biopsy. Still, these treatments did not result in a full remission or cure. Moreover, neither the size nor duration of these trials was sufficient to determine an effect on survival without liver transplantation. Accordingly, more data are needed to confirm the benefit and safety in PBC of steroids alone or in combination with UDCA. Nevertheless, these studies disproved an earlier notion that corticosteroids would cause rapid progression of the bone disease osteoporosis in patients with PBC.' "
Budesonide (Entocort),"'Budesonide is a steroid that is more rapidly processed (metabolized) in the liver and, therefore, presumably would be less injurious to bone than other steroids. This drug was studied in selected patients with PBC who had had suboptimal (less than favorable) responses to UDCA. Unfortunately, budesonide was ineffective in this group. In fact it significantly worsened osteoporosis and did not prevent progression of the PBC. In contrast, a randomized trial comparing UDCA and placebo with a combination of budesonide and UDCA showed the combination to be more effective, while bone thinning (loss of mineral density) was comparable in the two groups. But here again, more data are needed to confirm the benefit and safety of this combination.' "
Azathioprine (Imuran),"'Imuran prevents the production of new lymphocytes (white blood cells that take part in immune responses) by blocking cell division (reproduction) of the lymphocytes. The consequence of this action is to reduce the number of new inflammatory cells entering the sites of inflammation. A large study comparing the effect of azathioprine with an inactive drug (placebo) in 248 patients with PBC, however, showed no benefit. Consequently, this drug is not currently recommended for use in PBC patients outside of research protocols.' "
"Cyclosporine (Sandimmune, Neoral, Gengraf)","'Cyclosporine is a powerful immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporine (Sandimmune, Neoral, Gengraf) is used primarily to prevent rejection of transplanted organs. The drug prevents production of an important signal required for lymphocytes to divide (reproduce) and generate inflammation. A large study of 349 PBC patients, comparing cyclosporine with an inactive drug, showed some benefit from the cyclosporine. The frequency of the side effects of ''high blood pressure'' and decreased kidney function, however, make this drug unacceptable for long-term use.' "
"Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall)","'Methotrexate both suppresses the immune system and prevents cells from dividing. This drug has been used successfully in severe ''rheumatoid arthritis'' and an immunologic skin disease called ''psoriasis''. Initial limited trials in patients with PBC did not show a benefit, and serious side effects included ulcerations of the mouth, ''hair loss'', and ''pneumonia''. Additionally, preliminary reports of randomized, controlled trials of methotrexate therapy of PBC in Europe noted a higher than expected rate of a form of ''pneumonia'' that ''scars'' the ''lungs''. Moreover, a recently published randomized, controlled trial of low dose methotrexate in PBC showed serious toxicity over a six-year period. Currently, a large trial in the United States comparing UDCA alone to a combination of UDCA and methotrexate is underway. At present, it is premature to recommend the use of methotrexate to treat PBC outside of clinical trials.' "
Obeticolic acid (Ocaliva),"'Ocaliva was approved by the FDA in May 2016 for the treatment of PBC in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with inadequate response or are intolerant to UDCA, or as a single therapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. In such patients, nearly 50% showed an improvement in the liver tests. The most common adverse effect is pruritus, observed in over 50% patients. The most common side effects include ''fatigue'', ''abdominal pain'' and discomfort, ''joint pain'', ''pain'' in the middle part of the throat, ''dizziness'', ''constipation'', and itching.' "
Cholestyramine (Questran) for itching,"'Cholestyramine'' is a drug taken orally that is not absorbed in the gut. The drug attaches (binds) to substances in the gut, including those that came from the bile, and then removes them from the body into the bowel movements. Presumably, cholestyramine is helpful because it binds both bile acids and unidentified substances that cause itching after they are absorbed from the gut into the blood stream. Cholestyramine is the most effective therapy for most patients with cholestatic itching. For optimal effects, cholestyramine should be taken with meals when bile flow into the gut is highest. A somewhat larger dose with breakfast is recommended for patients with gallbladders since the bile stored overnight in the gallbladder is released at this time.''It is important to note that cholestyramine can also bind to medications. Therefore, it is important that other medicines be taken one hour before or two hours after cholestyramine. The usual dosage is 8 grams with breakfast, 4 grams with lunch, and 4 grams with dinner. Cholestyramine does not dissolve well in liquids and often feels gritty as it is swallowed. Mixing it in carbonated ''beverages'', however, can reduce this problem. ''The principal side effect of cholestyramine is ''constipation''. The ''constipation'' occurs because the drug binds the bile acids that otherwise would make more water available in the colon to soften the ''stool''. Adverse reactions of cyclosporine include:''Another bile acid-binding medication that can be tried to relieve itching is ''colestipol'' (''Colestid'').' Kidney dysfunction Tremor High blood pressure Gum hyperplasia"
Rifampin for itching,"'An antibiotic, rifampin (Rifidin) was initially found to improve itching due to ''cholestasis'' actually by chance. Then, a study of patients with PBC that included a cross-over between rifampin and an inactive compound (placebo) showed that rifampin did reduce itching at a dose of 150 mg taken two or three times per day. This drug may take up to one month to be effective, but should not take longer. Therefore, if the drug is not effective after one month, it should be discontinued. Not all patients with PBC benefit from this drug.''The way in which rifampin works is poorly understood. It can induce biochemical pathways in hepatocytes that theoretically may alter the bile acid environment within these cells. The side effects of rifampin include elevation of bilirubin, ''dark urine'', ''hepatitis'' (more rarely), reduced numbers of blood platelets (small elements that help stop bleeding from a cut surface), and kidney damage.' "
Opiod antagonists for itching,"""The fact that some patients who receive opiate narcotics (such as morphine) develop itching led to the hypothesis that itching in cholestasis may be caused by the body's natural opiates, called endorphins. To test this hypothesis, patients with PBC who had itching were treated with the oral drug nalmephene, an antagonist (acts against or blocks the action) of opiates. Itching improved over a 9-month period. Some patients treated with the opiate antagonist, however, developed very unpleasant symptoms of opiate ""'withdrawal'' when their natural endorphins were inhibited. Therefore, this drug is not appropriate for long-term use in PBC. A controlled study comparing an intravenous opiate antagonist called naloxone (''Narcan'') with inactive intravenous fluids showed that the naloxone improved itching in PBC patients. Because it must be given intravenously, naloxone also is inappropriate for long-term use.''Recently, the oral opiate antagonist, naltrexone (Revia), was tested in a small, randomized, controlled trial in PBC patients with itching. It improved itching in 50% of patients and did not cause opiate withdrawal symptoms. Naltrexone also improved symptoms of ''fatigue'' and ''depression'', possibly by restoring the ability to ''sleep'' at night when itching is most severe. However, future studies are needed to assess its safety, how long it can be given, and whether patients will eventually become unresponsive (refractory) to its effects.' "
Charcoal hemoperfusion for itching,"'In uncontrolled studies, patients with PBC who had severe itching underwent a procedure called plasmapheresis. (Uncontrolled studies are studies in which the treatment is not ''compared'' with other treatments or placebos.) In this procedure, the blood is removed from the body, and the fluid phase (called plasma) of the blood is separated from the blood cells and platelets. The plasma is then percolated through a column containing activated charcoal. Finally, the plasma is remixed with the blood cells and returned intravenously to the patient. The idea is that the charcoal would remove some compound or compounds (as yet unknown) from the plasma that caused the itching. Anecdotally, many patients had relief of itching for periods ranging from days to months. However, no controlled trials (compared with other treatments or placebos) were performed. Hence, this procedure is still considered experimental and is not often used.' "
Osteoporosis medications,"'Whether the usually recommended therapies for osteoporosis can satisfactorily treat or prevent osteoporosis in patients with PBC is not yet clear. It makes good sense, however, to provide adequate calcium and ''vitamin D'' in the ''diet''. The ''vitamin D'' is needed for absorption of calcium from the gut. Adequate amounts of calcium can be taken by eating dairy products such as milk or yogurt or by supplementing the ''diet'' with 1000 to 1500 mg of ''calcium carbonate''. Calcium carbonate, prepared from powdered oyster shells, can be purchased over the counter. Usually, the extra ''vitamin D'' contained in a daily multivitamin is enough to satisfy the daily requirement. Exposure of the skin to sunlight also increases the production of vitamin D in the body.''For ''postmenopausal'' women with PBC, hormonal replacement therapy with estrogen can decrease the risk of osteoporosis. Estrogen, available in oral form or as a patch that allows absorption of estrogen through the skin, is safe for women with PBC. Remember, however, that there is controversy about the use of ''estrogen replacement'' therapy in postmenopausal women who have had ''breast cancer'', because of a possible risk of recurrence of the ''cancer''. There is also concern about prolonged use of ''estrogens'' with progestin in increasing the risk of coronary ''heart'' diseases, ''strokes'', and ''pulmonary embolism'"" in healthy menopausal women. Therefore, whether to use estrogen or not should be individualized after consulting one's doctor. Another alternative to estrogen to protect ""'bone density'' in patients with PBC is the bisphosphonates, which are FDA-approved drugs for the ''prevention'' of osteoporosis. Too few studies have been performed using other drugs (for example, fluoride or ''calcitonin'') for osteoporosis to recommend their use in PBC.' "
Treatment of elevated serum cholesterol and xanthomas,"'Elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood are common in patients with PBC, and xanthomas (fatty deposits that appear as yellowish firm nodules in the skin) occur in about 25% of those patients with elevated cholesterol. Diets with low cholesterol content do not consistently lower serum cholesterol in these patients, because production of cholesterol by the liver is stimulated in patients with PBC. Cholestyramine, the oral medication that is often used to treat itching, can, at the same time, reduce the levels of serum cholesterol to a modest degree.''Clofibrate (Atromid) should not be used for treating elevated serum cholesterol in PBC because it elevates (rather than lowers) the ''cholesterol levels'' in these patients. Moreover, this drug may worsen xanthomas and cause formation of ''gallstones'' containing cholesterol. Two studies indicate that UDCA therapy significantly reduces serum levels of cholesterol and is recommended for use in patients with xanthomas. A new class of drugs called ''statins'' inhibits formation of cholesterol and, to a lesser degree, ''triglycerides''. The safety and effectiveness of the statins, however, have not been adequately studied in PBC. One of the common side effects of statins is liver injury. Thus, their use in a person with ''liver disease'' requires careful monitoring by a physician.' "
"Treatment of malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K)","'Reduction of dietary fat is the treatment of choice for fat malabsorption (poor absorption of fat in the gut). The idea is that if the dietary intake of fat is decreased, more of this fat will be absorbed. The goal of the low-fat diet would be to alleviate the diarrhea caused by the fat malabsorption, while still providing enough fat for adequate ''nutrition''. If this diet does not help, a supplement of special ''fats'' called '' medium-chain'' ''triglycerides'' (MCT) can be ingested. MCT can replace as much as 60% of the calories provided by ordinary dietary fat, which is mostly '' long-chain'' ''triglycerides''. MCT is a special type of fat preparation that does not require bile acids for its absorption and is actually absorbed more easily than the usual dietary fat. As noted earlier, PBC patients with malabsorption of fat should also be tested for ''celiac sprue''.''It is recommended that patients with PBC take a multivitamin supplement without ''minerals'' to increase the dietary intake of fat-soluble ''vitamins''. If the quantities of bile acids flowing through the bile ducts to the gut are marginal, intestinal absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins may not be adequate, even with ''supplements''. Two strategies exist for this situation. First, patients can take Liqui-E with meals. Liqui-E is an ''over-the-counter'' liquid preparation of ''vitamin E'' that also increases the absorption of other fat-soluble vitamins in the diet or in multivitamin preparations. Second, the fat-soluble vitamins A and K can be given by injection into the muscle once a month. Remember, however, that women who might become pregnant, should not receive injections of ''vitamin A'', because it can cause ''birth defects''.' "
Treatment of edema and ascites,"'Retention of salt and water can lead to swelling of the ankles and legs (edema) or abdomen (ascites) in patients with cirrhosis. Diuretics are medications that work in the kidneys to combat retention of fluid by eliminating salt and water into the urine. A combination of the diuretics ''spironolactone'' (''Aldactone'') and ''furosemide'' (''Lasix'') can reduce or eliminate the swelling in most people. During treatment with diuretics, it is important to monitor kidney function by measuring serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and ''creatinine'' to determine if the doses of the diuretics are safe. Sometimes, when the diuretics do not work, a long needle is used to draw out the fluid directly from the abdomen (a procedure called paracentesis).' "
Treatment of bleeding from varices,"'If large varices (distended veins) develop in the ''esophagus'' or upper stomach or any episodes of bleeding from varices have occurred, physicians should consider specific therapy for the varices. Treatment with ''propranolol'' (''Inderal''), a drug in a class called ''beta-blockers'', is effective in preventing initial bleeding or rebleeding from varices in patients with cirrhosis. This drug, however, has not been proven to prevent bleeding in patients with portal ''hypertension'' who do not have cirrhosis.''Other methods are available to prevent or treat varices. These methods include:' Procedures done during upper endoscopy (for example band ligation of the varices) Other drugs, for example, octreotide (Sandostatin) Other non-surgical procedures (for example, a procedure called TIPS to decrease the portal pressure) A surgical operation to create a shunt (passage) from the high-pressure portal vein to veins with lower pressure can eliminate blood flow into the varices. It is appropriate to consider such a surgical shunt for patients with PBC and portal hypertension who do not have cirrhosis or have only early cirrhosis. The hazards of shunt surgery in these patients would be less than those in patients with advanced cirrhosis."
Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy,"'PBC patients with an abnormal ''sleep'' cycle, impaired thinking, odd behavior, or other signs of ''hepatic encephalopathy'' usually should be treated with a low ''protein diet'' and oral ''lactulose''. Dietary protein is restricted because it is a source of the toxic compounds present in hepatic ''encephalopathy''. The lactulose, which is a liquid medication, traps the toxic compounds in the colon. Consequently, they cannot be absorbed into the bloodstream and cause the symptoms of encephalopathy. To be sure that adequate lactulose is present in the colon at all times, the patient should adjust the dose to produce 2 to 3 semiformed bowel movements a day. If symptoms of encephalopathy persist, the oral antibiotics,\xa0such as ''rifaximin'', can be added to the treatment regimen.' "
Treatment of enlarged spleen,"'The blood filtration function of an ''enlarged spleen'' usually results in only mild reductions of ''red blood cells'' (''anemia''), white blood cells (leukopenia) and platelets (''thrombocytopenia'') that do not require treatment. Severe ''anemia'', however, may require blood transfusions or treatment with ''erythropoietin'' or ''epoetin alfa'' (''Epogen'', ''Procrit''), a hormone that stimulates production of red blood cells. If the numbers of white blood cells are severely reduced, another hormonal drug, called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is available to increase the white blood cells. An example of an available G-CSF drug is ''filgrastim'' (''Neupogen'').''No FDA-approved medication is available yet to increase the number of platelets. As a necessary precaution, patients with low platelets should not use ''aspirin'' or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (''NSAIDS'') since these drugs can hinder the function of platelets. If a low number of platelets is associated with significant bleeding, transfusions of platelets usually should be given. Surgical removal of the spleen (called splenectomy) should be avoided, if possible, because of the risk of excessive bleeding during the operation and the risk of anesthesia in advanced ''liver disease''.' "
Treatment of Sicca syndrome,"'Dry eyes'':'' For chronically ''dry eyes'', use artificial tears containing methylcellulose without preservatives. These artificial tears can prevent the complications of dry eyes, such as ulcers of the ''cornea''.''Dry mouth'':'' Patients with ''dry mouth'' have a reduced amount of watery saliva but maintain production of thick saliva. Chewing gum or sucking on a small object can stimulate more watery saliva. Others may need to moisten the mouth with fluids. It is imperative that all patients with ''dry mouth'' take adequate amounts of fluids to help with swallowing during meals or when taking oral medications. It is also recommended that these patients have frequent dental appointments to check for ''cavities''.''Dry vagina:'' Lubricating jelly is suggested to prevent painful sexual intercourse. If a woman is postmenopausal, estrogen creams are also recommended to improve the function of the cells lining the vagina.' "
Treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon,"""PBC patients with Raynaud's phenomenon should restrict exposure to the ""'cold'"". They can wear warm clothing, gloves, and shoes when they must be in cold environments. Some patients find that using gloves also helps avoid problems when they handle ice-cold articles, for example frozen food packages and cold cans of soda. All patients with Raynaud's phenomenon should stop ""'smoking'' cigarettes because ''smoking'' causes reduced blood flow in the blood vessels of the hands and ''feet''. Drugs called ''calcium channel blockers'' help the symptoms in the hands and feet of some patients. At the same time, unfortunately, however, these drugs may worsen swallowing difficulties associated with ''scleroderma''.' "
Treatment of scleroderma,"'Skin tightening, calcification, or telangiectasia:'' There is no known therapy to prevent or reverse skin tightening, calcium deposits, or ''telangiectasias'' in patients with scleroderma.''Swallowing problems'' and ''heartburn'':'' As previously mentioned, patients with scleroderma may experience heartburn or ''difficulty swallowing''. It is recommended that patients with these symptoms or other evidence of scleroderma or the ''CREST syndrome'':' Take drugs called proton pump inhibitors 
	(PPIs) to reduce stomach acid. Avoid eating or drinking within 2 hours of lying down or going to bed. Elevate the head of the bed about 6 to 8 inches. This gentle slope helps prevent stomach acid from flowing up into the esophagus. Consult a gastroenterologist (a specialist in diseases of the esophagus and stomach) to undergo an upper endoscopy to assess the interior of esophagus and stomach."
Treatment of gallstones,"'Cholesterol ''gallstones'' may be '' prevented'' by the UDCA used for the long-term treatment of the PBC itself. (UDCA taken orally can actually dissolve cholesterol gallstones in a '' minority'' of patients.) No treatment is necessary for patients who have gallstones that are not causing symptoms. These patients should usually just be observed because they will probably never develop symptoms from their gallstones.''An operation (cholecystectomy) to remove the gallbladder and its gallstones should be considered if the gallstones have been causing symptoms. These symptoms ordinarily are bouts of rather characteristic ''abdominal pain''. This surgery usually should ''not ''be done, however, if a patient has ''advanced ''cirrhosis because of the increased risk of complications from both the surgery and the PBC. In this situation, less risky procedures can be considered or, if the gallstones are the cholesterol type, UDCA (if not already being used to treat the PBC) can be given reasonably safely to try to dissolve the gallstones.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat PBC?,"'Most often, people will contact their primary care health-care professional with questions about the color of their ''stool''. These includes health-care professionals who care for infants and children and adults. Depending upon the cause of the stool color change, certain specialists may need to be involved. For example, for red or ''black stool'' due to bleeding, a gastroenterologist may be needed to perform endoscopy, to look for a bleeding source in the stomach or intestine. Patients with PBC are generally treated by gastroenterologists and/or hepatologists. Development of complications may require the need for other specialists. For example, an endocrinologist may be needed for the treatment of metabolic bone disease (osteoporosis). Patients who develop hepatocellular ''carcinoma'' may need the help of several specialists including an oncologist, interventional radiologist, and a liver surgeon. Patients with advanced liver disease including cirrhosis of the liver should be referred to a transplant center as they may need a ''liver transplant'' at some stage in the future.  ' "
What is the role of liver transplantation in PBC?,"'Liver transplantation is a life-saving operation for those patients with PBC who are at risk of premature death due to liver failure or the complications of cirrhosis and portal ''hypertension''. The Mayo Risk Score provides an accurate estimate of the future outcome (prognosis) for patients, regardless of whether they are being treated with ursodeoxycholic acid. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) permits patients with PBC to be listed for a liver transplant once their estimated survival with PBC for an additional year is 95% or less. It is recommended that physicians calculate the Mayo Risk Score at least yearly in all patients with PBC who have cirrhosis.''Most PBC candidates for transplantation have advanced cirrhosis with ''decompensated'' liver disease, which also is referred to as liver failure. Decompensated liver disease means that the patients have low levels of serum albumin and blood clotting factors made in the liver and complications of portal venous hypertension such as ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, or hypersplenism. Patients are classified as having decompensated cirrhosis whether or not the complications respond to medical therapy.''Rarely, '' before'' advanced cirrhosis develops, transplantation of the liver is warranted in a few clinically disastrous situations in PBC. Examples of such situations include recurrent ''fractures'' due to advanced osteoporosis or severe, debilitating itching unrelieved by any medical therapy, and even more rarely the hepatopulmonary syndrome (''breathing'' difficulty in advanced cirrhosis). The regional review committees of UNOS accept applications for transplantation in these special circumstances and decide on a patient-by-patient basis if liver transplantation is indicated.''The outcome of liver transplantation in PBC is excellent. The survival of patients two or more years after transplantation is generally 80%. This impressive survival rate is greater than the survival of patients transplanted for most other types of liver diseases. The titers of AMA fall following successful liver transplantation, but they do not usually disappear. A minority of patients, however, develops recurrent PBC in the transplanted liver. Studies are being performed to see if reducing the maintenance doses of immunosuppressive drugs more slowly after transplantation can prevent recurrence of PBC. Once recurrent PBC is diagnosed, ursodeoxycholic acid therapy is started to retard progression. Patients with recurrent PBC rarely will need a second liver transplant.' "
What is the future for PBC?,"'The goal of ongoing and future research in PBC is to better understand the processes (mechanisms) that initiate and perpetuate the inflammation that destroys first the small caliber bile ducts and later the hepatocytes. Logically, a more complete understanding of these mechanisms will reveal new strategies for therapy, designed to block specific crucial steps in the progression of disease.''PBC is such a slowly progressive disease that it is often initially diagnosed after the development of cirrhosis. Future therapies will probably include strategies that differ for patients with early disease compared to those with advanced disease. Presumably, patients with early phases of PBC would benefit more from therapies that block immunologic mechanisms of bile duct destruction than would patients whose bile ducts have already been destroyed. Conversely, patients whose bile ducts have already been destroyed may benefit more from therapies that prevent the formation of ''scar tissue'' and the toxic consequences of cholestasis.''The key to success is support of both basic science and clinical research in PBC, which have not been adequately funded in the past. Several promising research strategies are being pursued to reveal the mechanisms involved in developing PBC. For example, studies are in progress to evaluate the genetic (hereditary) characteristics of patients with PBC who have close relatives with the disease. By studying all of these patients with PBC and comparing them with other family members without PBC, it may be possible to better understand the predispositions to this disease. In addition, a large-scale study is underway in the United States that will compare PBC patients with healthy people of the same age and gender. The points of comparison will include their life experiences, habits, diet, medical and surgical histories, childbearing history, and exposures to environmental toxins and medications. This study likewise should provide important clues regarding predispositions to PBC.'' Studies also are in progress to see if PBC may be initiated (triggered) by an infection with either bacteria or ''viruses''. For example, studies are ongoing to confirm or disprove the notion that proteins of infectious organisms stimulate AMA autoantibodies (and the autoantibodies just happen to react to antigens present in the mitochondria). Other studies are dissecting the mechanisms involved in the lymphocyte migration toward small bile ducts and the lymphocyte killing of bile duct epithelial cells. These studies involve not only ''patients'' with PBC, but also several animal models in which T-lymphocytes destroy small bile ducts in an identical manner to that seen in PBC. These studies ultimately should identify new ways to treat PBC by, for example, blocking the killing of bile ducts by T-lymphocytes.''Finally, the issue of ''scar'' tissue formation in PBC and other diseases associated with cholestasis is now being researched in the hope of finding a way to prevent the development of cirrhosis. If cirrhosis can be prevented, even if ongoing inflammation of the liver continues, many patients might not develop the complications of portal venous hypertension and the progression to liver failure.' "
What is tinnitus?,"'Tinnitus'' is not a condition in itself, but a symptom of some other condition that causes a high-pitched whine, a ringing, buzzing or clicking in the ears. It can come from any number of problems starting with the eardrum and cochlea – the organs that turn sound waves into electrical signals for the brain to interpret as sound. Causes can range in gravity from a ''tumor'' near the ear, nerve damage, repetitive ''trauma'' from loud noise or constant air pressure changes, to simple deterioration of the ear organs through ''aging''.' "
Are there home remedies for tinnitus?,'The following home remedies may be of benefit to some individuals with ''tinnitus''.' Dietary restrictions including avoiding caffeine and decreasing salt intake Smoking cessation Zinc supplements Melatonin Ginkgo biloba
What is the treatment for tinnitus?,"'Tinnitus is a common complaint, with up to 15% of Americans having experienced it. It is the most common symptom reported by military service members returning from combat.' Tinnitus may last for weeks or months and then resolve spontaneously. For some people, tinnitus may last for years. The tinnitus may be significant enough to interfere with an individual's activities of daily living. For this reason, treatment must also be directed at decreasing the effects of tinnitus on a person's daily life, such as depression, insomnia, etc. For those people whose tinnitus is caused by an adverse or toxic reaction to a medication, stopping the drug may allow the hearing mechanism to recover; however, talk with your doctor before stopping any medication. Sometimes the adverse effects of medications on hearing may be permanent. Electrical stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation are some of the other treatment considerations available for certain individuals with tinnitus. Benzodiazepine medications, including alprazolam (Xanax), may help suppress nerve function and decrease tinnitus symptoms. Corticosteroid injections into the middle ear may decrease inflammation in certain cases of tinnitus. Antidepressant medications may decrease the intensity of tinnitus or resolve the noise altogether. Moreover, antidepressants may also help with the depression that is sometimes associated with the presence of persistent and chronic tinnitus. Prostaglandin analogs, such as misoprostol (Cytotec), may be of some help in some people with tinnitus."
What kind of doctor treats tinnitus?,"'Often tinnitus can be evaluated by a primary-care doctor or internist, but if consultation is needed, an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat doctor) is the specialist that evaluates and cares for people with tinnitus. Audiologists are trained to perform hearing tests and assessments.' "
What is sciatica?,"'The ''sciatic nerve'' is the largest nerve in the body. It’s rooted in the lower back and extends through the rump, providing nerve endings through the leg. ''Sciatica'' or sciatic ''nerve pain'' is centered on the lower back, and the cause is usually from a ''ruptured disc'' in the spinal column that irritates or inflames the nerve. Bone, tumors, muscles, and infections can also cause inflammation of the ''sciatic nerve'' and the resulting back and ''leg pain''.' "
What is the treatment for sciatica?,"'Bed rest has been traditionally advocated for the treatment of acute ''sciatica''. But how useful is it?''To study the effectiveness of bed rest in patients with ''sciatica'', a research team in the Netherlands led by Dr. Patrick Vroomen randomly assigned 183 such patients to bed rest or, alternatively, to watchful waiting for this period.''The results, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that after two weeks, 70% patients in the bed-rest group reported improvement, as compared with 65% of the patients in the control (watchful-waiting) group. After 12 weeks, 87% of the patients in both groups reported improvement. The results of assessments of the intensity of ''pain'', the aggravation of symptoms, and functional status revealed no significant differences between the two groups. The extent of absenteeism from work and rates of surgical intervention were similar in the two groups.''The researchers concluded that ""among patients with symptoms and signs of sciatica, bed rest is not a more effective therapy than watchful waiting."" Sometimes, conventional wisdom is not as wise as research!''Other treatment options for sciatica depend on its cause and include addressing the underlying cause.' Transcutaneous nerve stimulators (TENS units) are sometimes useful for more chronic forms of sciatica. A variety of low back conditioning and stretching exercises are employed to help people recover from sciatica. Medications used in the treatment of sciatica include pain relievers, muscle relaxants, anti-inflammatories, and antidepressants.Antidepressants actually can help in this setting by reducing pain perception in the brain.Other medications that may be helpful include gabapentin (Neurontin) and duloxetine (Cymbalta). Antidepressants actually can help in this setting by reducing pain perception in the brain. Other medications that may be helpful include gabapentin (Neurontin) and duloxetine (Cymbalta). Cortisone medications, given orally or by local injection (epidural injection), can sometimes be helpful in relieving sciatica. Surgical procedures can sometimes be required for persisting sciatica that is caused by nerve compression at the lower spine. Sometimes pain management specialists help with chronic sciatica conditions."
What are home remedies for sciatica?,"'Keys to the management of acute ''sciatica'' include relief of ''pain'' and relaxing associated ''muscle spasms''. Home remedies include' heat and cold pack administration, over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), naproxen (Aleve), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and aspirin, and gradual exercises and stretching."
What type of doctor treats sciatica?,"'Physician specialties that evaluate and treat sciatica range from generalists to subspecialists. These specialties include''Other health care providers for ''low back pain'' include physical therapists, chiropractors, ''massage'' therapists, psychologists, and acupuncturists.' general medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, gynecology, orthopaedics, neurosurgery, rheumatology, pain management, and physiatry."
What is impetigo?,"'Impetigo'' is a bacterial ''skin infection'' that causes a ''rash'' that forms ''blisters'' and can ooze pus, causing a crust. ''Impetigo'' can be caused by different kinds of bacteria, including ''strep'' and ''staph''. Usually, impetigo is easy to treat and rarely leaves scarring.' "
Are there home remedies for impetigo?,"'An impetigo infection is not serious and is very treatable. Mild impetigo can be handled by gentle cleansing of the sores, removing crusts from the infected person, and applying the prescription antibiotic ointment ''mupirocin'' (Bactroban). Nonprescription topical antibiotic ointments (such as ''Neosporin'') generally are not effective.' "
What is the treatment for impetigo?,"'More severe or widespread impetigo, especially of bullous impetigo, may require oral antibiotic medication. In recent years, more staph germs have developed resistance to standard antibiotics. Bacterial culture tests can help a doctor to guide the use of proper oral therapy if needed. Antibiotics which can be helpful include ''penicillin'' derivatives (such as ''amoxicillin''-clavulanic acid [''Augmentin'']) and cephalosporins such as ''cephalexin'' (''Keflex''). If clinical suspicion supported by culture results show other bacteria, such as drug-resistant staph (''methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus'' or ''MRSA''), other antibiotics such as ''clindamycin'', ''doxycycline'' (Doryx) or ''trimethoprim''-''sulfamethoxazole'' (''Bactrim'' or ''Septra'') may be necessary.' "
What kind of doctor treats impetigo?, 
What is psoriasis?,"'Psoriasis'' is an incurable chronic autoimmune disorder of the skin that causes patches of thick, flaky, scaly skin, mostly around the ''scalp'', knees, and elbows, though any skin surface may be involved. Some people experience only small patches while others have red, inflamed skin and think scaly patches all over the body. The exact cause of ''psoriasis'' is not clear, but it isn’t ''contagious''.' "
What is the treatment for psoriasis?,"'Psoriasis'' is not currently curable. However, it can go into remission, producing an entirely normal skin surface. Ongoing research is actively making progress on finding better treatments and a possible cure in the future.''There are many effective ''psoriasis'' treatment choices. The best treatment is individually determined by the treating doctor and depends, in part, on the type of disease, the severity, and amount of skin involved and the type of insurance coverage.''It is important to keep in mind that as with any medical condition, all medicines carry possible side effects. No medication is 100% effective for everyone, and no medication is 100% safe. The decision to use any medication requires thorough consideration and discussion with your health care provider. The risks and potential benefits of medications have to be considered for each type of ''psoriasis'' and the individual. Of two patients with precisely the same amount of disease, one may tolerate it with very little treatment, while the other may become incapacitated and require treatment internally.''A proposal to minimize the toxicity of some of these medicines has been commonly called ""rotational"" therapy. The idea is to change the anti-''psoriasis'' ''drugs'' every six to 24 months in order to minimize the toxicity of one medication. Depending on the medications selected, this proposal can be an option. An exception to this proposal is the use of newer biologic medications as described below. An individual who has been using strong topical steroids over large areas of their body for prolonged periods may benefit from stopping the steroids for a while and rotating onto a different therapy.''Coal tar shampoos are very useful in controlling ''psoriasis of the scalp''. Using the shampoo daily can be very beneficial adjunctive therapy. There are a variety of ''over-the-counter'' shampoos available without a prescription. There is no evidence that one shampoo is superior to another. Generally, the selection of a tar shampoo is simply a matter of personal preference.''Oral medications include ''methotrexate'' (''Trexall''), ''acitretin'' (''Soriatane''), ''cyclosporine'' (''Neoral''), ''apremilast'' (''Otezla''), and others. Oral ''prednisone'' (''corticosteroid'') is generally not used in ''psoriasis'' and may cause a disease flare-up if administered.' For mild disease that involves only small areas of the body (less than 10% of the total skin surface), topical treatments (skin applied), such as creams, lotions, and sprays, may be very effective and safe to use. Occasionally, a small local injection of steroids directly into a tough or resistant isolated psoriatic plaque may be helpful. For moderate to severe psoriasis that involves much larger areas of the body (>10% or more of the total skin surface), topical products may not be effective or practical to apply. This may require ultraviolet light treatments or systemic (total body treatments such as pills or injections) medicines. Internal medications usually have greater risks. Because topical therapy has no effect on psoriatic arthritis, systemic medications are generally required to stop the progression to permanent joint destruction. Acitretin (Soriatane) is an oral drug used for certain types of psoriasis. It is not effective in all types of diseases. It may be used in males and females who are not pregnant and not planning to become pregnant for at least three years. The major side effects include dryness of skin and eyes and temporarily elevated levels of triglycerides and cholesterol (fatty substance) in the blood. Blood tests are generally required before starting this therapy and are needed periodically to monitor triglyceride levels. Patients should not become pregnant while on this drug and usually avoid becoming pregnant for at least three years after stopping this medication. Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressive drug used for other medical uses, including organ transplantation. It may be used for severe, difficult-to-treat cases of widespread psoriasis. Improvement and results may be very rapid in onset. It may be hard to get someone off of cyclosporine without flaring their psoriasis. Because of the potential cumulative toxicity, cyclosporine should not be used for more than one to two years for most psoriasis patients. Major possible side effects include kidney and blood-pressure problems. Methotrexate is a common drug used for rheumatoid arthritis, and it has been used effectively for many years in psoriasis. It is usually given in small weekly doses (5 mg-25 mg), either orally or by injection. Blood tests are required before and during therapy. The drug may cause liver and lung damage. Close physician monitoring and monthly to quarterly visits and labs are generally required. FDA has approved a new oral drug, apremilast (Otezla), to treat psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with an entirely novel mode of action (inhibition of an enzyme, phosphodiesterase 4) and does not require intensive laboratory monitoring."
What are topical remedies for psoriasis?,"'Topical (skin applied) treatments include ''topical corticosteroids'', ''vitamin D'' analogue creams like calcipotriene (Calcitrene, ''Dovonex'', ''Sorilux''), topical retinoids (''tazarotene'' [''Tazorac'']), moisturizers, topical immunomodulators (''tacrolimus'' and ''pimecrolimus''), coal tar, anthralin, and others.' Topical corticosteroids (steroids, such as hydrocortisone) are very useful and often the first-line treatment for limited or small areas of psoriasis. These come in many preparations, including sprays, liquid, creams, gels, ointments, and foams. Steroids come in many different strengths, including stronger ones that are used for elbows, knees, and tougher skin areas and milder ones for areas like the face, underarms, and groin. These are usually applied once or twice a day to affected skin areas. Strong steroid preparations should be limited in use. Overuse or prolonged use may cause problems, including potential permanent skin thinning and damage called atrophy. Calcipotriene cream is useful in psoriasis because of its effect on calcium metabolism. The advantage of calcitriol is that it is not known to thin the skin like topical steroids. There is a newer combination preparation of calcipotriene and a topical steroid called Taclonex. Not all patients may respond to calcipotriene. Prolonged use of these types of medications on more than 20% of the skin surface can produce an abnormal rise in body calcium levels. Moisturizers, especially with therapeutic concentrations of salicylic acid, lactic acid, urea, and glycolic acid may be helpful in psoriasis. These moisturizers are available as prescription and nonprescription forms. They help reduces the scales that impede the movement of topical medications into the deeper layers of the skin. Some available preparations include salicylic acid (Salex) and lactic acid (AmLactin, Lac-Hydrin). These may be used one to three times a day on the body. Other bland moisturizers, including Vaseline and Crisco vegetable shortening, may also be helpful in at least reducing the dry appearance of psoriasis. Immunomodulators (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) have also been used with some limited success in mild psoriasis. These have the advantage of not causing skin thinning. They may have other potential side effects, including skin infections and possible malignancies (cancers). The exact association of these immunomodulator creams and cancer is controversial. Bath salts or bathing in high-salt-concentration waters like the Dead Sea in the Middle East along with careful exposure to sunlight can be beneficial to psoriasis patients. Coal tar is available in multiple preparations, including shampoos, bath solutions, and creams. Coal tar may help reduce the appearance and decrease the flakes in psoriasis. The odor, staining, and overall messiness with coal tar may make it less desirable than other therapies. A major advantage of tar is the lack of skin thinning. Anthralin is available for topical use as a cream, ointment, or paste. The stinging, possible irritation, and skin discoloration may make this less acceptable to use. Anthralin may be applied for 10-30 minutes to psoriatic skin."
What kind of doctor treats psoriasis?,"'Dermatologists are doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis, and ''rheumatologists'' specialize in the treatment of joint disorders and ''psoriatic arthritis''. Many kinds of doctors may treat psoriasis, including dermatologists, family physicians, internal medicine physicians, ''rheumatologists'', and other medical doctors.''The American Academy of Dermatology and the National Psoriasis Foundation are excellent sources to help find doctors who specialize in this disease. Not all dermatologists and rheumatologists treat psoriasis. The National Psoriasis Foundation has one of the most up-to-date databases of current psoriasis specialists.''It is now apparent that patients with psoriasis are prone to a variety of other associated disease conditions. ''Cardiovascular disease'', ''diabetes'', ''hypertension'', ''inflammatory bowel disease'', ''hyperlipidemia'', ''liver'' problems, and ''arthritis'' are more common in patients with psoriasis. It is very important for all patients with psoriasis to be carefully monitored by their primary care providers for these associated illnesses.' "
What are tremors?,"'Tremor'' is an involuntary, rhythmic muscle contraction leading to shaking movements in one or more parts of the body. It is a common movement disorder that most often affects the hands but can also occur in the arms, head, vocal cords, torso, and legs. Tremor may be intermittent (occurring at separate times, with breaks) or constant. It can occur sporadically (on its own) or happen as a result of another disorder.' Tremor is most common among middle-aged and older adults, although it can occur at any age. The disorder generally affects men and women equally. Tremor is not life threatening. However, it can be embarrassing and even disabling, making it difficult or even impossible to perform work and daily life tasks."
What are the symptoms and signs of tremors?,"'Symptoms of tremor may include:''Some tremor may be triggered by or become worse during times of ''stress'' or strong emotion, when an individual is physically exhausted, or when a person is in certain postures or makes certain movements.' a rhythmic shaking in the hands, arms, head, legs, or torso shaky voice difficulty writing or drawing problems holding and controlling utensils, such as a spoon"
What causes tremors?,"'Generally, tremor is caused by a problem in the deep parts of the brain that control movements. Most types of tremor have no known cause, although there are some forms that appear to be ''inherited'' and run in families.''Tremor can occur on its own or be a symptom associated with a number of neurological disorders, including:''Some other known causes can include:'   multiple sclerosis stroke traumatic brain injury neurodegenerative diseases that affect parts of the brain (e.g., Parkinson's disease) the use of certain medicines (particular asthma medication, amphetamines, caffeine, corticosteroids, and drugs used for certain psychiatric and neurological disorders) alcohol abuse or withdrawal mercury poisoning overactive thyroid liver or kidney failure anxiety or panic"
What are the types or tremors?,"'Tremor is most commonly classified by its appearance and cause or origin. There are more than 20 types of tremor. Some of the most common forms of tremor include:''Essential tremor (previously also called benign essential tremor or familial tremor) is one of the most common movement disorders. The exact cause of essential tremor is unknown. For some people this tremor is mild and remains stable for many years. The tremor usually appears on both sides of the body, but is often noticed more in the dominant hand because it is an action tremor.''The key feature of essential tremor is a tremor in both hands and arms, which is present during action and when standing still. Additional symptoms may include head tremor (e.g., a “yes” or “no” motion) without abnormal posturing of the head and a shaking or quivering sound to the voice if the tremor affects the voice box. The action tremor in both hands in essential tremor can lead to problems with writing, drawing, drinking from a cup, or using tools or a computer.''Tremor frequency (how “fast” the tremor shakes) may decrease as the person ages, but the severity may increase, affecting the person’s ability to perform certain tasks or activities of daily living. Heightened emotion, ''stress'', ''fever'', physical exhaustion, or ''low blood sugar'' may trigger tremor and/or increase its severity. Though the tremor can start at any age, it most often appears for the first time during adolescence or in middle age (between ages 40 and 50). Small amounts of ''alcohol'' may help decrease essential tremor, but the mechanism behind this is unknown.''About 50 percent of the cases of essential tremor are thought to be caused by a genetic risk factor (referred to as familial tremor). Children of a parent who has familial tremor have greater risk of inheriting the condition. Familial forms of essential tremor often appear early in life.''For many years essential tremor was not associated with any known disease. However, some scientists think essential tremor is accompanied by a mild degeneration of certain areas of the brain that control movement. This is an ongoing debate in the research field.''Dystonic tremor occurs in people who are affected by ''dystonia'' -- a movement disorder where incorrect messages from the brain cause muscles to be overactive, resulting in abnormal postures or sustained, unwanted movements. Dystonic tremor usually appears in young or middle-aged adults and can affect any muscle in the body. Symptoms may sometimes be relieved by complete relaxation.''Although some of the symptoms are similar, dystonic tremor differs from essential tremor in some ways. The dystonic tremor:''Cerebellar tremor is typically a slow, high-amplitude (easily visible) tremor of the extremities (e.g., arm, leg) that occurs at the end of a purposeful movement such as trying to press a button. It is caused by damage to the cerebellum and its pathways to other brain regions resulting from a ''stroke'' or ''tumor''. Damage also may be caused by disease such as ''multiple sclerosis'' or an inherited degenerative disorder such as ''ataxia'' (in which people lose muscle control in the arms and legs) and ''Fragile X syndrome'' (a disorder marked by a range of intellectual and developmental problems). It can also result from chronic damage to the cerebellum due to ''alcoholism''.''Psychogenic tremor (also called functional tremor) can appear as any form of tremor. Its symptoms may vary but often start abruptly and may affect all body parts. The tremor increases in times of stress and decreases or disappears when distracted. Many individuals with psychogenic tremor have an underlying psychiatric disorder such as ''depression'' or ''post-traumatic stress disorder'' (''PTSD'').''Physiologic tremor occurs in all healthy individuals. It is rarely visible to the eye and typically involves a fine shaking of both of the hands and also the fingers. It is not considered a disease but is a normal human phenomenon that is the result of physical properties in the body (for example, rhythmical activities such as ''heart'' beat and muscle activation).''Enhanced physiological tremor is a more noticeable case of physiologic tremor that can be easily seen. It is generally not caused by a neurological disease but by reaction to certain drugs, ''alcohol withdrawal'', or medical conditions including an overactive thyroid and ''hypoglycemia''. It is usually reversible once the cause is corrected.''Parkinsonian tremor is a common symptom of Parkinson’s disease, although not all people with Parkinson’s disease have tremor. Generally, symptoms include shaking in one or both hands at rest. It may also affect the chin, lips, face, and legs. The tremor may initially appear in only one limb or on just one side of the body. As the disease progresses, it may spread to both sides of the body. The tremor is often made worse by stress or strong emotions. More than 25 percent of people with Parkinson’s disease also have an associated action tremor.''Orthostatic tremor is a rare disorder characterized by rapid muscle contractions in the legs that occur when standing. People typically experience feelings of unsteadiness or imbalance, causing them to immediately attempt to sit or walk. Because the tremor has such a high frequency (very fast shaking) it may not be visible to the naked eye but can be felt by touching the thighs or calves or can be detected by a doctor examining the muscles with a stethoscope. In some cases the tremor can become more severe over time. The cause of orthostatic tremor is unknown.' is associated with abnormal body postures due to forceful muscle spasms or cramps can affect the same parts of the body as essential tremor, but also -- and more often than essential tremor -- the head, without any other movement in the hands or arms can also mimic resting tremor, such as the one seen in Parkinson’s disease. Also, the severity of dystonic tremor may be reduced by touching the affected body part or muscle, and tremor movements are “jerky” or irregular instead of rhythmic."
What are resting and action tremors?,"'Tremor can be classified into two main categories:''Resting tremor'' occurs when the muscle is relaxed, such as when the hands are resting on the lap. With this disorder, a person’s hands, arms, or legs may shake even when they are at rest. Often, the tremor only affects the hand or fingers. This type of tremor is often seen in people with Parkinson’s disease and is called a “pillrolling” tremor because the circular finger and hand movements resemble rolling of small objects or pills in the hand.''Action tremor'' occurs with the voluntary movement of a muscle. Most types of tremor are considered action tremor. There are several sub-classifications of action tremor, many of which overlap.' Postural tremor occurs when a person maintains a position against gravity, such as holding the arms outstretched. Kinetic tremor is associated with any voluntary movement, such as moving the wrists up and down or closing and opening the eyes. Intention tremor is produced with purposeful movement toward a target, such as lifting a finger to touch the nose. Typically the tremor will become worse as an individual gets closer to their target. Task-specific tremor only appears when performing highly-skilled, goal-oriented tasks such as handwriting or speaking. Isometric tremor occurs during a voluntary muscle contraction that is not accompanied by any movement such as holding a heavy book or a dumbbell in the same position."
What procedures and tests diagnose tremors?,"'Tremor is diagnosed based on a physical and neurological examination and an individual’s medical history. During the physical evaluation, a doctor will assess the tremor based on:''The doctor will also check other neurological findings such as impaired balance, speech abnormalities, or increased muscle ''stiffness''. Blood or urine tests can rule out metabolic causes such as thyroid malfunction and certain medications that can cause tremor. These tests may also help to identify contributing causes such as ''drug interactions'', chronic alcoholism, or other conditions or diseases. Diagnostic imaging may help determine if the tremor is the result of damage in the brain.''Additional tests may be administered to determine functional limitations such as difficulty with handwriting or the ability to hold a fork or cup. Individuals may be asked to perform a series of tasks or exercises such as placing a finger on the tip of their nose or drawing a spiral.''The doctor may order an ''electromyogram'' to diagnose muscle or nerve problems. This test measures involuntary muscle activity and muscle response to nerve stimulation.' whether the tremor occurs when the muscles are at rest or in action the location of the tremor on the body (and if it occurs on one or both sides of the body) the appearance of the tremor (tremor frequency and amplitude)."
What is the treatment for tremors?,"'Although there is no cure for most forms of tremor, treatment options are available to help manage symptoms. In some cases, a person’s symptoms may be mild enough that they do not require treatment.''Finding an appropriate treatment depends on an accurate diagnosis of the cause. Tremor caused by underlying health problems can sometimes be improved or eliminated entirely with treatment. For example, tremor due to thyroid ''hyperactivity'' will improve or even resolve (return to the normal state) with treatment of thyroid malfunction. Also, if tremor is caused by medication, discontinuing the tremor-causing drug may reduce or eliminate this tremor.''If there is no underlying cause for tremor that can be modified, available treatment options include:''A new treatment for essential tremor uses magnetic resonance images to deliver focused ''ultrasound'' to create a lesion in tiny areas of the brain’s thalamus thought to be responsible for causing the ''tremors''. The treatment is approved only for those individuals with essential tremor who do not respond well to anticonvulsant or beta-blocking drugs.''When people do not respond to drug therapies or have a severe tremor that significantly impacts their daily life, a doctor may recommend surgical interventions such as ''deep brain stimulation'' (DBS) or very rarely, thalamotomy. While DBS is usually well tolerated, the most common side effects of tremor surgery include ''dysarthria'' (trouble speaking) and balance problems.'   Beta-blocking drugs such as propranolol are normally used to treat high blood pressure but they also help treat essential tremor. Propranolol can also be used in some people with other types of action tremor. Other beta-blockers that may be used include atenolol, metoprolol, nadolol, and sotalol. Anti-seizure medications such as primidone can be effective in people with essential tremor who do not respond to beta-blockers. Other medications that may be prescribed include gabapentin and topiramate. However, it is important to note that some anti-seizure medications can cause tremor. Tranquilizers (also known as benzodiazepines) such as alprazolam and clonazepam may temporarily help some people with tremor. However, their use is limited due to unwanted side effects that include sleepiness, poor concentration, and poor coordination. This can affect the ability of people to perform daily activities such as driving, school, and work. Also, when taken regularly, tranquilizers can cause physical dependence and when stopped abruptly can cause several withdrawal symptoms. Parkinson’s disease medications (levodopa, carbidopa) are used to treat tremor associated with Parkinson's disease. Botulinum toxin injections can treat almost all types of tremor. It is especially useful for head tremor, which generally does not respond to medications. Botulinum toxin is widely used to control dystonic tremor. Although botulinum toxin injections can improve tremor for roughly three months at a time, they can also cause muscle weakness. While this treatment is effective and usually well tolerated for head tremor, botulinum toxin treatment in the hands can cause weakness in the fingers. It can cause a hoarse voice and difficulty swallowing when used to treat voice tremor. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is the most common form of surgical treatment of tremor. This method is preferred because it is effective, has low risk, and treats a broader range of symptoms than thalamotomy. The treatment uses surgically implanted electrodes to send high-frequency electrical signals to the thalamus, the deep structure of the brain that coordinates and controls some involuntary movements. A small pulse-generating device placed under the skin in the upper chest (similar to a pacemaker) sends electrical stimuli to the brain and temporarily disables the tremor. DBS is currently used to treat parkinsonian tremor, essential tremor, and dystonia. Thalamotomy is a surgical procedure that involves the precise, permanent destruction of a tiny area in the thalamus. Currently, surgery is replaced by radiofrequency ablation to treat severe tremor when deep brain surgery is contraindicated -- meaning it is unwise as a treatment option or has undesirable side effects. Radiofrequency ablation uses a radio wave to generate an electric current that heats up a nerve and disrupts its signaling ability for typically six or more months. It is usually performed on only one side of the brain to improve tremor on the opposite side of the body. Surgery on both sides is not recommended as it can cause problems with speech. Physical, speech-language, and occupational therapy may help to control tremor and meet daily challenges caused by the tremor. A physical therapist can help people improve their muscle control, functioning, and strength through coordination, balancing, and other exercises. Some therapists recommend the use of weights, splints, other adaptive equipment, and special plates and utensils for eating. Speech-language pathologists can evaluate and treat speech, language, communication, and swallowing disorders. Occupational therapists can teach individuals new ways of performing activities of daily living that may be affected by tremor. Eliminating or reducing tremor-inducing substances such as caffeine and other medication (such as stimulants) can help improve tremor. Though small amounts of alcohol can improve tremor for some people, tremor can become worse once the effects of the alcohol wear off."
Are tremors life-threatening?,"'Tremor is not considered a life-threating condition. Although many cases of tremor are mild, tremor can be very disabling for other people.''The symptoms of essential tremor usually worsen with age. Additionally, there is some evidence that people with essential tremor are more likely than average to develop other neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease, especially in individuals whose tremor first appears after age 65.''Unlike essential tremor, the symptoms of physiologic and drug-induced tremor do not generally worsen over time and can often be improved or eliminated once the underlying causes are treated.' It can be difficult for individuals with tremor to perform normal daily activities such as working, bathing, dressing, and eating. Tremor can also cause “social disability.” People may limit their physical activity, travel, and social engagements to avoid embarrassment or other consequences."

What is trichinosis worm infection? Is it a sexually transmitted disease (STD)?,"'Trichinosis is a disease caused by parasitic roundworms (nematodes) that can infect and damage body tissues. Nematodes are a major division of the helminth family of parasitic worms (for example, ''Trichinella spiralis''). When ingested, these parasitic worms can pass through the intestinal tract to invade other tissues, such as muscle, where they persist. Trichinosis is also termed trichinellosis, trichiniasis, or trichinelliasis. Trichinosis is not to be confused with ''trichomoniasis'', a ''sexually transmitted disease'' caused by the ''Trichomonas vaginalis'' parasite.'  "
What are the signs and symptoms of trichinosis worms?,"'Trichinosis is usually characterized by two phases:''In addition, there can be ""splinter"" hemorrhages under the fingernails and eye inflammation (''conjunctivitis''). People with trichinosis infection may:' The initial phase (intestinal) of abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, heartburn, and nausea that begins one to two days after ingestion. The second phase (muscle) of muscle aches, itching, fever, chills, and joint pains that begins about two to eight weeks after ingestion. Develop swelling around the eyes Low fever Abdominal cramps"
What causes trichinosis worms? Is it spread by pork?,"'Trichinosis is caused by ''Trichinella'' species (parasitic nematodes, intestinal worms, and roundworms) that initially enter the body when meat containing the ''Trichinella'' ''cysts'' (roundworm larvae) is eaten. For humans, undercooked or raw pork and pork products, such as pork sausage, has been the meat most commonly responsible for transmitting the ''Trichinella'' parasites. It is a food-borne infection and not ''contagious'' from one human to another unless infected human muscle is eaten. However, almost any carnivore (meat eater) or omnivore (eats meat and plants for food) can both become infected and, if eaten, can transmit the disease to other carnivores and omnivores. For example, undercooked or raw bear meat can contain livable ''Trichinella'' cysts. Therefore, if humans, ''dogs'', pigs, rats, or mice eat the meat, they can become infected. In rare instances, larvae in cattle feed can infect cattle. There are six species that are known to infect humans:''Two other species, ''T. papuae'' (found in pigs in New Guinea) and ''T. zimbabwensis'' (found in crocodiles in Tanzania) have not been reported to infect humans to date. There are other ''strains'' (antigenic variants related to named species) that are unnamed and can infect humans. Trichinellosis trichinosis is not spread as to person; infection only occurs when raw undercooked meat containing the parasite is ingested.''In 2017, at least 17 people were diagnosed with the disease after eating smoked brown bear cub meat in Kataiga, Russia.''Trichinosis is not a sexually transmitted disease (''STD'').'  T. spiralis found in many carnivorous and omnivorous animals worldwide. T. britovi found in carnivorous animals in Europe and Asia. T. pseudospiralis found in mammals and birds worldwide. T. nativa found in arctic mammals (for example, bears, foxes). T. nelsoni found in African mammals (for example, lions, hyenas). T. murrelli found in wild animals in the U.S."
How common is trichinosis worm infection?,"'Trichinosis is a common disease in many wild carnivorous and omnivorous animals worldwide, except for Australia. Infection is now relatively rare in the United States. During 2015 through 2015, 16 cases were reported per year, on average. For example, the United States has averaged only about 12-20 cases per year in the last two decades. However, there are outbreaks that occur sporadically in the world when meat (especially pork) is improperly cooked or is contaminated with undercooked or raw wild-game meat. If the source of the outbreak is a meat supplier, hundreds of people can become infected as was the situation that occurred in Poland in 2007.' "
How long can trichinosis worms live?,"'The life cycle of this particular parasite is key to the way disease develops in humans. In 1835, J. Paget and R. Owen first discovered larvae of ''Trichinella'' in a piece of human muscle during an ''autopsy''. That same year, R. Virchow and F. Zenker discovered the complicated life cycle of ''Trichinella'' by feeding a dog ''Trichinella''-infected meat.''In humans, the larvae are ingested, released from an encapsulated (encysted) ''cyst'' by stomach acid (except for the nonencapsulated ''T. pseudospiralis'""), and then develop into adult male and female worms in the gastrointestinal tract. The adult worms mate and then shed larvae that penetrate the gastrointestinal tract and reach the bloodstream and lymph drainage system. The larvae are then distributed to body cells (mainly skeletal muscle cells). Some skeletal muscle cells develop into nurse cells that support and protect the larvae from the host's immune system. The life cycle that requires at least two hosts. Humans are usually an incidental host.""'Trichinellosis in humans is acquired by ingesting meat containing cysts (encysted larvae) of ''Trichinella''. After exposure to gastric acid and pepsin, the larvae are released from the cysts and invade the small bowel mucosa where they develop into adult worms (female 2.2 mm in length, males 1.2 mm; life span in the small bowel: four weeks). After one week, the females release larvae that migrate to the striated muscles where they encyst. ''Trichinella pseudospiralis'', however, does not encyst. Encystment is completed in four to five weeks, and the encysted larvae may remain viable for several years. Ingestion of the encysted larvae perpetuates the cycle. Rats and rodents are primarily responsible for maintaining the endemicity of this infection. Carnivorous/omnivorous animals, such as pigs or bears, feed on infected rodents or meat from other animals. Different animal hosts are implicated in the life cycle of the different species of ''Trichinella''. Humans are accidentally infected when eating improperly cooked meat of these carnivorous animals (or eating food contaminated with such meat).' "
What are the risk factors for getting trichinosis worms?,"'The major risk factor for contracting trichinosis is eating raw or undercooked pork or wild game such as bear meat, wild boar meat, or other carnivore meat. The risk of developing infection is related to the amount of larvae ingested. About 10 larvae per gram of meat (muscle) ingested result in a mild infection, about 50-500 result in a moderate infection, while over 1,000 result in a severe infection. Consequently, reducing or eliminating the number of larvae in infected meat reduces both the risk and severity of infection. This is accomplished by cooking meat to a uniform temperature of 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher for at least a few minutes to kill encysted larvae. Freeze pork less than 6 inches thick for 20 days at 5 F (-15 C). However, this freezing technique for wild game meat may not be effective, as ''Trichinella'' in wild animals is usually not as susceptible to freeze killing. Other cooking methods such as microwaving, ''smoking'', or salting meat often fail to kill the encysted larvae and so the risk of getting trichinosis from meat treated by these methods is increased.' "
What are the complications associated with trichinosis worms?,"'For some people with trichinosis, these complications can slowly resolve over six months.''In other patients, the complications can persist for years.' About 90%-95% of trichinosis infections have either minor or no symptoms and no complications. The World Health Organization (WHO) allows the use of mebendazole in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy; however, both OB/Gyn and Pediatric specialists should be contacted for utilizing various drugs. People with more serious symptoms, however, may develop complications, for example:Heart muscleInflammation (myocarditis)Pulmonary problems, for example:CoughShortness of breathLung hemorrhage (bleeding in the lung) Heart muscle Inflammation (myocarditis) Pulmonary problems, for example: Cough Shortness of breath Lung hemorrhage (bleeding in the lung) Also, central nervous system (CNS) problems may develop. The CNS symptoms are diverse and include:ConfusionDeliriumAtaxia,Seizures,VertigoAuditory and speech changes along with many other neurological deficits. Confusion Delirium Ataxia, Seizures, Vertigo Auditory and speech changes along with many other neurological deficits."
What procedures and tests diagnose trichinosis worms?,"'There are no accurate tests for the early phase of infection of the ''intestines''. The history of eating raw or undercooked meat could be the first clue. Unfortunately, most people infected do not seek physician help during the relatively short intestinal phase. During the muscle phase of the disease, a presumptive clinical diagnosis can be made with a history of ''eyelid'' swelling, ''pain'', tenderness, swelling in muscles, small hemorrhages that resemble small splinters under the fingernails, and the ''conjunctivitis'' of the eyes. These symptoms occur a few weeks after eating the raw or undercooked meat from pork or wild animals. Other blood tests that are elevated, but not specific for trichinosis, are creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase (enzymes that increase in the blood when muscle cells are damaged or destroyed). Also, a particular type of white blood cell, eosinophils, are usually increased several times their normal concentration after the muscle phase starts, but eosinophil count increases can also occur in other parasitic infections and ''allergies''.'""More specific tests (indirect immunofluorescence, latex agglutination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) are available that detect antibodies developed by the infected person's immune response to the parasites. However, these tests may not be positive until three or more weeks after infection and may be falsely positive in patients with infections with other parasites or autoimmune diseases. The best test for trichinosis is a biopsy of muscle that shows larvae in the muscle tissue. In general, biopsies are done infrequently and the diagnosis is based on presumptive clinical findings, patient history, and associated blood tests outlined above. In addition, trichinosis often occurs in outbreaks (a number of infections occurring at about the same time). For trichinosis, outbreaks occur when a number of people eat infected meat from the same source. For example, in 2007, over 200 patients were diagnosed with trichinosis in Poland when a meat-processing plant sold ""'Trichinella''-contaminated pork to customers. Knowledge of the source of an outbreak can help identify and diagnose individuals that may be exposed to the parasites; it can also allow the source of the infections to be eliminated.' "
What is the treatment and prognosis for trichinosis worms? Is there a cure?,"   Most trichinosis infections have minor symptoms and do not require any treatment as all symptoms resolve without treatment. In those with more intense symptoms, thiabendazole (Mintezol) can be used to eliminate the adult worms in the gastrointestinal tract. Albendazole (Albenza) is another drug that may be used in some cases. The invasive and encysted larva forms of Trichinella species are treated by mebendazole (Vermox). Inflammation of infected tissues is usually treated with prednisone and is frequently used in combination with mebendazole."
What prevention steps can you take for trichinosis worms?,"'Yes, trichinosis can be prevented. The CDC has outlined specific ways to prevent this disease as follows:''*According to USDA, ""A \'rest time\' is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, oven, or other heat source. During the three minutes after meat is removed from the heat source, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys pathogens.""' The best way to prevent trichinellosis is to cook meat to safe temperatures. A food thermometer should be used to measure the internal temperature of cooked meat. Do not sample meat until it is cooked. USDA recommends the following for meat preparation.For whole cuts of meat (excluding poultry and wild game)Cook to at least 145 F (63 C) as measured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, then allow the meat to rest* for three minutes before carving or consuming.For ground meat (including wild game, excluding poultry)Cook to at least 160 F (71 C); ground meats do not require a rest* time.For all wild game (whole cuts and ground)Cook to at least 160 F (71 C).For all poultry (whole cuts and ground)Cook to at least 165 F (74 C), and for whole poultry, allow the meat to rest* for three minutes before carving or consuming. For whole cuts of meat (excluding poultry and wild game)Cook to at least 145 F (63 C) as measured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, then allow the meat to rest* for three minutes before carving or consuming. Cook to at least 145 F (63 C) as measured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, then allow the meat to rest* for three minutes before carving or consuming. For ground meat (including wild game, excluding poultry)Cook to at least 160 F (71 C); ground meats do not require a rest* time. Cook to at least 160 F (71 C); ground meats do not require a rest* time. For all wild game (whole cuts and ground)Cook to at least 160 F (71 C). Cook to at least 160 F (71 C).

What is trichomoniasis?,"'Trichomoniasis is a ''sexually transmitted infection'' (STI) caused by a parasite. The parasite is spread most often through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. It is one of the most common STIs in the United States and affects more women than men. It is easily treated with antibiotics, but many women do not have symptoms. If left untreated, trichomoniasis can raise your risk of getting ''HIV''.'  "
How do you get trichomoniasis?,"'Trichomoniasis is spread through:' Vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Trichomoniasis can be spread even if there are no symptoms. This means you can get trichomoniasis from someone who has no signs or symptoms. Genital touching. A man does not need to ejaculate (come) for trichomoniasis to spread. Trichomoniasis can also be passed bet"
Who gets trichomoniasis?,'Trichomoniasis is more common in women than men. It affects more than 2 million women ages 14 to 49 in the United States.''Trichomoniasis affects more African-American women than white and Hispanic women. The risk for African-American women goes up with age and lifetime number of sex partners' 
What are the signs and symptoms of trichomoniasis?,"'Most infected women have no signs or symptoms. If you do get signs or symptoms, they might appear five to 28 days after exposure and can include:''If you think you may have trichomoniasis, you and your sex partner(s) need to see a doctor or nurse as soon as possible.'   Irritation and itching in the genital area Thin or frothy discharge (clear, white, yellowish, or greenish) with an unusual foul odor Discomfort during sex and when urinating Lower abdominal pain (this is rare)"
Is there a test to diagnose trichomoniasis?,"'To find out whether you have trichomoniasis, your doctor or nurse may:''A ''Pap test'' is not used to detect trichomoniasis.''If you have trichomoniasis, you need to be tested for other STIs too.'   Do a pelvic exam Use a cotton swab to take a fluid sample from your vagina to look for the parasite under a microscope Do a lab test, such as a DNA test or a fluid culture. A culture tests uses urine or a swab from your vagina. The parasite then grows in a lab. It takes up to a week for the parasite to grow enough to be seen."
What is the treatment to cure trichomoniasis?,"'Trichomoniasis us easily cured with one of two antibiotics:''These antibiotics are usually a pill you swallow in a single dose.''If you are treated for trichomoniasis, your sex partner(s) needs to be treated too. Do not have sex until you and your sex partner(s) finish taking all of the antibiotics and have no symptoms.'   
Metronidazole (me-truh-NYD-uh-zohl) 
	 Tinidazole (teye-NID-uh-zohl)"
What can happen if trichomoniasis is not treated?," Most people with trichomoniasis have no symptoms and never know they have it. Even without symptoms, it can be passed to others. If you have trichomoniasis, you are at higher risk of getting HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) if you are exposed to HIV. 
	 If you are 
	HIV-positive, having trichomoniasis also raises your risk of passing HIV to your sex partner(s). 
	 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that women with HIV get screened for trichomoniasis at least once a year."
What should I do if I have trichomoniasis?,"'Trichomoniasis is easy to treat. But you need to be tested and treated as soon as possible. If you have trichomoniasis:'   See a doctor or nurse as soon as possible. Antibiotics will treat trichomoniasis. Take all of your medicine. Even if symptoms go away, you need to finish all of the antibiotics. Tell your sex partner(s) so they can be tested and treated. Avoid sexual contact until you and your partner(s) have been treated and cured. Even after you finish your antibiotics, you can get trichomoniasis again if you have sex with someone who has trichomoniasis. See your doctor or nurse again if you have symptoms that don’t go away within a few days after finishing the antibiotics."
Does trichomoniasis affect pregnancy?,'''Pregnant'' women with trichomoniasis are at higher risk of premature birth (''babies'' born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) or a low-birth-weight baby (less than 5 1/2 pounds). Premature birth and a low birth weight raise the risk of health and developmental problems at birth and later in life.''The antibiotic metronidazole can be used to treat trichomoniasis during any stage of pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of taking any medicine during pregnancy.'  
Can I take medicine to cure trichomoniasis if I am breastfeeding?,'You can take the antibiotic metronidazole if you are ''breastfeeding''. Your doctor may suggest waiting 12 to 24 hours after taking metronidazole before breastfeeding. Do not take tinidazole if you are breastfeeding.' 
How can I prevent trichomoniasis?,"'The best way to prevent trichomoniasis or any STI is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. If you do have sex, lower your risk of getting an STI with the following steps:''The steps work best when used together. No single step can protect you from every single type of STI.' Use condoms. Condoms are the best way to prevent STIs when you have sex. Because a man does not need to ejaculate (come) to give or get trichomoniasis, make sure to put the condom on before the penis touches the vagina, mouth, or anus. Other methods of birth control, like birth control pills, shots, implants, or diaphragms, will not protect you from STIs. Get tested. Be sure you and your partner are tested for STIs. Talk to each other about the test results before you have sex. Be monogamous. Having sex with just one partner can lower your risk for STIs. After being tested for STIs, be faithful to each other. That means that you have sex only with each other and no one else. Limit your number of sex partners. Your risk of getting STIs goes up with the number of partners you have. Do not douche. Douching removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protects you from infection. This may increase your risk of getting STIs. Do not abuse alcohol or drugs. Drinking too much alcohol or using drugs increases risky behavior and may put you at risk of sexual assault and possible exposure to STIs."
Can women who have sex with women get trichomoniasis?,"'Yes. It is possible to get trichomoniasis, or any other STI, if you are a woman who has sex only with women.''Talk to your partner about her sexual history before having sex, and ask your doctor about getting tested if you have signs or symptoms of trichomoniasis.' "
Introduction to Heart Valve Surgery,'Diseased ''heart'' valves can be treated both surgically (traditional heart valve surgery) and non-surgically (balloon valvuloplasty).' 
What Happens During Traditional Heart Valve Surgery?,"'During traditional heart valve surgery, a surgeon will make an incision down the center of your sternum (breastbone) to get direct access to your heart. The surgeon then repairs or replaces your abnormal heart valve or valves.'  "
What Happens During Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery?,"'Minimally invasive heart valve surgery is a type of surgery performed through smaller incisions. This type of surgery reduces blood loss, ''trauma'', and length of hospital stay.''Your surgeon will review your diagnostic tests prior to your surgery to determine if you are a candidate for minimally invasive valve surgery.''Often, the surgeon and cardiologist (heart doctor) will use transesophogeal echo (an ''ultrasound'' transducer probe that is passed down the throat) to help determine the functioning of the valve before and after surgery.' "
What Is Heart Valve Repair Surgery?,"'The ''mitral valve'' is the most commonly repaired heart valve, but the aortic, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves may also undergo some of these repair techniques. The valves are made up of leaflets or flaps.''If your valve can be repaired, your surgeon will perform any of the following types of valve repair procedures.''The advantages of heart valve repair surgery include:' Commissurotomy. Fused valve leaflets, or flaps, are separated to widen the valve opening. Decalcification. Calcium deposits are removed to allow the leaflets to be more flexible and close properly. Reshape leaflets. If one of the leaflets is floppy, a segment may be cut out and the leaflet sewn back together, allowing the valve to close more tightly. This procedure is called quadrangular resection. Chordal transfer. If a leaflet of the mitral valve has prolapse (floppy; lacking support), the chordae are transferred from one leaflet to the other. Then, the leaflet where the chordae was removed is repaired by quandrangular resection (see above). Annulus support. If the valve annulus (the ring of tissue supporting the valve) is too wide, it may be reshaped or tightened by sewing a ring structure around the annulus. The ring may be made of tissue or synthetic material. Patched leaflets. The surgeon may use tissue patches to repair any leaflets with tears or holes. decreased need for life-long blood thinner (anticoagulant) medication preserved heart muscle strength"
What If My Valves Cannot Be Repaired?,"'When you have aortic or pulmonic ''heart valve disease'', valve replacement surgery is usually performed. In some cases, the ''aortic valve'' can be repaired.''During valve replacement surgery, the faulty valve is removed and a new valve is sewn to the annulus of your original valve. The new valve can be a:' Mechanical valve. It is made totally of mechanical parts that are tolerated well by the body. The bi-leaflet valve is used most often. It consists of two carbon leaflets in a ring covered with polyester knit fabric. Biological valve. Tissue valves (also called biologic or bioprosthetic valves) are made of human or animal tissue. Animal tissue heart valves may come from pig tissue (porcine) or cow tissue (bovine). Tissue valves may have some artificial parts to help give the valve support and to aid placement. Homograft valve (also called allograft). It is an aortic or pulmonic human valve that has been removed from a donated human heart, preserved, and frozen under sterile conditions. A homograft may be used to replace a diseased aortic or pulmonic valve."
What Are the Pros and Cons of Each Type of Heart Valve?," Mechanical heart valves. The advantage to mechanical heart valves is their sturdiness. They are designed to last for many years. There are also drawbacks. Due to the artificial material involved, people who receive these valves will need to take life-long blood-thinner medication (anticoagulants) to prevent clots from forming in the mechanical valve. These clots can increase the risk for a stroke. Also, some people report a valve ticking sound that is usually not bothersome. It is the sound of the valve leaflets opening and closing. Biological heart valves. The advantage of biological heart valves is that most people do not need to take life-long blood thinners, unless they have other conditions (such as atrial fibrillation) that warrant it. Biologic valves, traditionally, were not considered as durable as mechanical valves, especially in younger people. Previously available biologic valves usually needed to be replaced after about 10 years. However, some studies show that some biologic valves may last at least 17 years without decline in function. This represents a new milestone in the durability of biologic valves. Homograft heart valves. Homografts are ideal heart valves for aortic valve replacement, especially when the aortic root is diseased or there is infection. The heart's natural anatomy is preserved and patients do not need to take life-long blood thinners. However, the limited availability is a drawback in some settings."
Are There Non-Surgical Options for Valve Disease?,"'Yes. Balloon valvotomy is used to increase the opening of a narrowed (stenotic) heart valve. It is used for select patients who have mitral valve stenosis (narrowing of the mitral valve) with symptoms, select older people who have ''aortic stenosis'' (narrowing of the aortic valve) but are not able to undergo surgery, and some patients with pulmonic stenosis (narrowing of the pulmonic valve).' "
What Happens During Balloon Valvotomy?,"'During a balloon valvotomy, a specially designed catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the groin and guided to the heart. The tip is directed inside the narrowed heart valve. Once there, a tiny balloon is inflated and deflated several times to widen the valve opening. Once the cardiologist is satisfied the valve has been widened enough, the balloon is removed.''During the procedure, the cardiologist may perform an ''echocardiogram'' (''ultrasound of the heart'') to get a better picture of the valve.''New research-based, non-surgical procedures to treat regurgitation (leaky valves) are being tested and may provide additional treatment options using a catheter for valve disease in the future.' "
Introduction to trigeminal neuralgia (TN),"'The brain is connected to the body by the spinal cord with spinal nerves sending and receiving impulses and messages to and from the brain. However, there are twelve cranial nerves that directly connect to the body. These nerves are involved with the muscle and sensory function of the head and neck. (The exception is cranial nerve X or the vagus nerve, which is also responsible for the parasympathetic system of the chest and abdomen).''The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) is so named because it has three (tri) branches responsible for face sensation; one branch also regulates chewing.' The ophthalmic branch (V1) is responsible for sensation from the scalp, forehead, upper eyelid and tip of the nose. The maxillary branch (V2) sensation covers the lower eyelid, the side of the nose, the upper lip and cheek, and the upper teeth and gums. The mandibular branch (V3) is responsible for sensation of the lower teeth and gums, lower lip, chin, jaw, and part of the ear. It is also responsible for supplying the muscles involved with chewing (mastication), those muscles involved with chewing."
What is trigeminal neuralgia (TN)?,"'Trigeminal neuralgia is inflammation of the trigeminal nerve, causing intense facial ''pain''. It is also known as tic douloureax because the intense ''pain'' can cause patients to contort their face into a grimace and cause the head to move away from the pain. The obvious movement is known as a tic.''The pain of trigeminal neuralgia is intense and may be an isolated episode or may be occur every few hours, minutes, or seconds. There can be months or years between attacks, but in some patients whose pain is not well controlled; it can lead to a ''chronic pain'' syndrome, affecting activities of daily life and cause ''depression''.''Though it can affect people of any age, trigeminal neuralgia tends to afflict people older than 60 years of age. It affects the right side of the face five times more often than the left.'  "
What causes trigeminal neuralgia?,"'Most often, the cause of trigeminal neuralgia is idiopathic, meaning the cause is not known. There are some instances when the nerve can be compressed by nearby blood vessels, aneurysms, or tumors.''There are inflammatory causes of trigeminal neuralgia because of systemic diseases including ''multiple sclerosis'', ''sarcoidosis'', and ''Lyme disease''. There also is an association with collagen vascular diseases including ''scleroderma'' and ''systemic lupus erythematosus''.'  "
What are the symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia?,"'Symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia include an acute onset of sharp, stabbing pain to one side of the face. It tends to begin at the angle of the jaw and radiate along the junction lines; between the ophthalmic branchV''1'' and maxillary branch V''2,'' or the maxillary branch V''2'' and the mandibular branch V''3''.''The pain is severe and described as an electric ''shock''. It may be made worse by light touch, chewing, or ''cold'' exposure in the mouth. In the midst of an attack, affected individuals shield their face trying to protect it from being touched. This is an important diagnostic sign because with many other pain syndromes like a  ''toothache'', the person will rub or hold the face to ease the pain.''While there may be only one attack of pain, the person may experience recurrent sharp pain every few hours or every few seconds. Between the attacks, the pain resolves completely and the the person has no symptoms. However, because of fear that the intense pain might return, people can be quite distraught. Trigeminal neuralgia tends not to occur when the person is asleep, and this differentiates it from ''migraines'', which often waken the person.''After the first episode of attacks, the pain may subside for months or years but there is always the risk that trigeminal neuralgia will recur without warning.'  "
How is trigeminal neuralgia diagnosed?,"'Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia is a clinical diagnosis and often no testing is required after the health care professional takes a history of the situation and performs a physical examination which should be normal.''It is important to remember that the neurologic exam must be normal. There are two specific areas to test. There can be no muscle ''weakness''; V''3'' is responsible for chewing and there can be no jaw or facial weakness found. The corneal reflex controlled by V''1'' must be present. When the ''cornea'' or covering of the eye is touched, the eye blinks in response. If these two findings are not normal, the search should begin for an inflammatory or compression cause of the trigeminal nerve. Some clinicians may order an ''MRI'' to help diagnose other conditions that may cause trigeminal neuralgia.''The International ''Headache'' Society has established criteria for making the diagnosis and includes the following:' Paroxysmal attacks of pain lasting from a fraction of a second to 2 
minutes, affecting 1 or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve and fulfilling 
criteria B and C. Pain has at least one of the following characteristics: (1) 
intense, sharp, superficial or stabbing; or (2) precipitated from trigger areas 
or by trigger factors  Attacks stereotyped in the individual patient  No 
clinically evident neurologic deficit  Not attributed to another disorder"
What is the treatment for trigeminal neuralgia?,"   Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia most often is treated with good success using 
a single anticonvulsant medication such as 
	carbamazepine (Tegretol). 
	 
Gabapentin 
	(Neurontin, Gabarone), 
	baclofen and 
	phenytoin 
	(Dilantin, Dilantin-125) may be used as second line drugs, often in 
addition to carbamazepine. In many patients, as time progresses, carbamazepine 
becomes less effective and these drugs can be used in combination to control the 
pain. Should pain persist and medication fail to be effective, surgery or radiation 
therapy may be other treatment options. 
Lamotrigine (Lamictal) may be prescribed for multiple sclerosis patients who 
develop trigeminal neuralgia."
What is trigger finger?,"'Trigger finger is a ""snapping"" or ""locking"" condition of any of the digits of the hand when opening or closing. ''Stenosing tenosynovitis'' is the medical term for trigger finger.' "
What causes trigger finger?,"'Local swelling from inflammation or scarring of the tendon sheath (tenosynovium) around the flexor tendons causes trigger finger. These tendons normally pull the affected digit inward toward the palm (flexion). When they are inflamed, they tend to catch where they normally slide through the tendon sheath.' "
What are risk factors for trigger finger?,"'Usually, trigger finger occurs as an isolated condition because of repetitive ''trauma''. Activities such as gardening, pruning, and clipping, etc., are risk factors for trigger finger. Sometimes, trigger finger is an associated condition resulting from an underlying illness or medical condition that causes inflammation of tissues of the hand, such as ''rheumatoid arthritis''. In fact, data presented at the 2005 American College of ''Rheumatology'' national meeting suggested that a majority of patients with ''rheumatoid arthritis'' have inflammation around the tendons of the palm of the hand that could develop into trigger finger. Trigger finger most often affects the right or left index finger, the digits likely to pull the trigger on a gun.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of trigger finger?,"'Symptoms and signs of trigger finger may occur when any of the four fingers of the hand attempts to flex closed while gripping. Instead of a smooth, continual closure, the digit hesitates, then snaps closed (causing a ""trigger"" affect) and is associated with a ''stiffness'' sensation of the digit. Symptoms and signs may occur in more than one digit. When attempting to extend the digit, a similar hesitation may occur before it ""snaps"" into full extension. In severe cases, people must manually bring the digits into full extension or flexion because of the stiffness. The closure is frequently associated with ''pain'"" at the base of the finger on the palm of the hand. Sometimes it's possible to feel a tender nodule in the area of the inflamed tendon. There may be mild swelling in the affected area of the palm. Triggering can also affect the thumb (trigger thumb, De Quervain syndrome), so many clinicians include the thumb in the diagnosis of trigger finger.""  "
What specialties of doctors diagnose and treat trigger finger?,"'Primary care doctors, including general practitioners, family medicine physicians, and internists, commonly diagnose trigger finger. Specialists who treat trigger finger include orthopedic surgeons, sports-medicine doctors, ''plastic'' surgeons, hand surgeons, and ''rheumatologists''. Occupational therapists and physical therapists can be involved in the care of patients with trigger finger.' "
How do health care professionals diagnose trigger finger?,"'Health care professionals diagnose trigger finger based on the history of ""snapping"" sensation that the patient experiences, as well as noting in the physical examination that there is tenderness and nodular irregularity of the involved flexor tendon in the palm of the hand. Typically, the nodule is not visible but can be felt in the palm. There can be contracture of the affected digit into a bent position.' "
What are trigger finger treatment options?,"'Stretching, ice, and anti-inflammation treatments can be helpful. Oral anti-inflammatory medications that may be helpful include ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), ''ibuprofen'' (''Motrin'', ''Advil''), ''diclofenac'' (''Voltaren'', ''Cataflam'', ''Cambia''), and others.''The quickest and most effective treatment is a local ''cortisone injection'' into the tendon sheath around the affected tendon. Most patients will respond well to the steroid injection (''corticosteroid'' injection such as kenalog, depomedrol, and others). Trigger finger can recur after a period of normal function. When a trigger finger persists after two steroid injections and is not responsive to the above nonsurgical treatments, consider surgical procedures to release the tendon sheath and/or remove the inflamed or scarred tissue. Trigger finger surgery is usually a permanent cure for this condition.'  "
Are there home remedies for trigger finger?,"'Initially, people can treat trigger finger at home with remedies including ''cold'' packs, resting, and ''over-the-counter'' medications, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ''drugs'' (''NSAIDs'') such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Massaging the involved area of the palm gently followed by cold pack application can be helpful. Take care to avoid reinjuring the strained tendon in the palm.' "
What is the prognosis of trigger finger?,'The prognosis of trigger finger is excellent. Nearly all patients recover completely after medical professionals administer cortisone injections and the tendon again glides freely through the tendon sheath. Sometimes it may be necessary to get repeat injections. Surgical treatments may be necessary in rare instances.' 
Is it possible to prevent trigger finger?,'People can prevent trigger finger by avoiding activities that strain the finger flexor tendons in the palms of the hands.' 
What is a trigger point?,"'Trigger points are focal areas of spasm and inflammation in skeletal muscle. The rhomboid and trapezius back muscles, located in the upper back and behind the shoulder areas, are a common site of trigger points. Trigger points in these areas can cause ''neck pain'', ''shoulder pain'', and ''headache''. In addition to the upper spine, trigger points can also occur in the low back or less commonly in the extremities.''Often there is a palpable nodule in the muscle where the trigger point is located. The area is tender, and frequently when pushed, ''pain'' radiates from the trigger point itself to an area around the trigger point. Trigger points commonly accompany chronic musculoskeletal disorders such as ''fibromyalgia'', myofascial ''pain'' syndrome, ''neck pain'', and ''low back pain''. They may also occur with tension ''headache'' and temporomandibular pain. Acute ''trauma'' or repetitive minor injury can lead to the development of trigger points.' "
What is a trigger point injection? What medications may be in a trigger point injection?,"'A trigger point injection (TPI) is an injection that is given directly into the trigger point for ''pain management''. The injection may be an anesthetic such as ''lidocaine'' (''Xylocaine'') or ''bupivacaine'' (''Marcaine''), a mixture of anesthetics, or a ''corticosteroid'' (cortisone medication) alone or mixed with lidocaine. Sometimes, a needle alone is inserted into the trigger point, and no medication is injected. This may be helpful and is referred to as ""dry needling."" With the injection, the trigger point is made inactive and the pain is relieved.' "
What types of doctors administer trigger point injections?,"'Trigger point injections are frequently administered by ''rheumatologists'', pain-management doctors, and physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors. Some internists, family practice doctors, generalists, and neurologists perform trigger point injections.' "
How do health care providers perform trigger point injections? What technique to physicians use to administer a trigger point injection?,"""The trigger point injection is performed in the health care professional's office, usually with the patient either lying on the exam table on the stomach or sitting on the exam table. The exact technique varies. The health care professional performing the procedure locates the trigger point by manual palpation and marks the site. ""'Ultrasound'' guidance is not generally necessary. The injection site is then cleaned. ''Alcohol'' or another skin cleanser such as betadine is commonly used to clean the injection site. Frequently, a numbing spray such as ethyl chloride is used to anesthetize the skin and make the actual injection less painful. The needle is then inserted into the trigger point and the medication is injected. After the injection, a simple adhesive bandage may be applied. If the area is painful after the injection, ice, heat, ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol''), or ''over-the-counter'' nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'') or ''naproxen'' sodium may be used.' "
When do patients need a trigger point injection?,"'Trigger point injection is used when a patient has a painful trigger point, especially when pain radiates from the trigger point to the surrounding area. Trigger point injections may be used as a treatment for conditions such as ''fibromyalgia'' and myofascial pain syndrome. However, the trigger points commonly recur with ''chronic pain'' syndromes.' "
What are complications and side effects of trigger point injections?,"'A potential complication from the trigger point injection procedure is post-injection pain. This is relatively uncommon, but it can occur. This pain usually resolves by itself after a few days. It is more common when no medication is injected into the trigger point (dry needling). Ice, heat, or over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen sodium may be useful for post-injection pain.''If a steroid medication is injected into the trigger point, there is a risk of shrinkage of the fat under the skin, leaving a dent in the skin. This does not occur when only anesthetic is injected without any steroid medication. Other side effects are rare with trigger point injections but can occur anytime a needle punctures the skin, including infection and bleeding.'  "
How frequently will patients need trigger point injections?,"'Optimally, a trigger point resolves after one injection. This may happen when a patient has one isolated trigger point, especially if the cause of the trigger point has been removed (such as a trigger point caused by a repetitive minor trauma or movement that will no longer be performed). Trigger points caused by chronic conditions such as fibromyalgia and myofascial pain syndrome tend to recur due the underlying problem. In these cases, trigger point injections may be administered on a regular or as needed basis. The frequency of trigger point injections depends on the medication being injected. If only lidocaine or a mixture of anesthetics is injected, then the injections can be administered as ongoing therapy as frequently as monthly. If a steroid medication is injected, TPIs should be administered much less frequently, at the discretion of the treating health care professional, because of the risk of tissue damage or shrinkage from the steroid medication.'

What is IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)?,"'Irritable bowel'' syndrome (''IBS'') is a chronic relapsing gastrointestinal (mainly the ''large intestine'' or colon) disorder with signs and symptoms that may include:''IBS'' is a chronic condition that can be triggered by ''diet'', medications and/or by other conditions such as ''stress''.''Some health care professionals categorize and term ''IBS'' into one of four categories:''Not all health care professionals recognize these four categories.' Abdominal cramping or pain Bloating Mucus in the stool Gassiness Altered bowel habits (alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation) IBS-D (predominant symptoms is diarrhea) IBS-C (predominant symptoms is constipation) IBS-M (mixed diarrhea and constipation) IBS-U (unclassified)"
Are stress and anxiety triggers for IBS?,"'Stress'' and ''anxiety'' may be triggers for IBS and the development of recurrent symptoms. Chronic stress experienced early in life (less than age 18) may increase the chances of developing the condition. Moreover, people diagnosed with IBS can have stress or ''anxiety'' trigger symptoms, such as:'   Diarrhea Constipation Abdominal bloating Mucus defecation Feelings of incomplete bowel movements"
Are menstrual pain and IBS related?,"'Some studies show that many women with IBS have worse symptoms during their menstrual periods. Although the mechanism is not clear, some gastrointestinal cells have receptors for estrogen and ''progesterone'' so that changes in the hormone levels during the ''menstrual cycle'' may trigger increasing ''IBS symptoms''. Women are twice as likely to develop IBS as men.' "
What foods in the diet trigger constipation in IBS?,"'Any foods or fluids that tend to dehydrate a person are likely to trigger ''constipation'' in people with ''irritable bowel'' syndrome. Foods that may promote constipation should be avoided in an IBS ''diet'' and include:''Foods that help prevent constipation and should be included in an IBS ''diet'' include:'   Chocolate Dairy products such as milk and cheese (particularly those that contain lactose) Red meat Unripe bananas Items that contain caffeine if you are slightly dehydrated. Coffee, carbonated drinks and alcohol may lead to dehydration and constipation in IBS patients (and other people, too). Prunes Various types of beans Whole grain breads like rye bread Pears and fruits like kiwi Vegetables that will help boost fiber intake"
What foods in the diet trigger diarrhea in IBS?,"   Several foods may play a role in developing diarrhea in people with IBS. Major categories of foods that may trigger IBS are those that contain fats (fatty meats, fatty dairy products, for example). Each individual is slightly different and may respond differently to food types. Consequently, dietitians and health care professionals who treat people with IBS often suggest that they keep a journal or diary to track those foods that cause diarrhea. Some foods that trigger diarrhea do so because they are ingested in large quantities; for example, a bite of a banana may not cause diarrhea, but eating a whole banana may trigger diarrhea in some people with IBS. Other foods that contain high levels of fructose, artificial sweeteners, high FODMAP foods, and fried foods may also trigger diarrhea. Broccoli, onions, cabbage and large helpings of beans may produce gas and increase the discomfort of diarrhea. Probiotics may help reduce the symptoms of diarrhea and gas in some individuals."
What prescription or OTC drugs trigger IBS?,"'Some ''drugs'' can trigger ''IBS symptoms'' resulting in colonic spasms, constipation and/or diarrhea. Such drugs include antibiotics (especially those administered over a long period of time), ''tricyclic antidepressants'', for example, ''amitriptyline'' (''Elavil'', ''Endep''), ''nortriptyline'' (''Pamelor''), and ''doxepin'', and medicines containing ''sorbitol'' (for example, some ''cough'' syrup preparations and common ''pain'' medicines like ''Advil'' gel capsules). Consequently, patients with the condition should check the ingredients, both active and inactive, for the presence of sorbitol as sorbitol is often listed as an ""inactive"" ingredient.' "
What are the other IBS triggers?,"'Other triggers of IBS are variable and differ from person to person. However, some other common triggers include:''Keep a journal and record the symptoms and the activities you are doing when symptoms develop. This can help you determine your personal triggers for any symptoms. Researchers also suggest that changes in hormone levels and/or other acute illnesses such as infectious diarrhea may also trigger symptoms.'""Although a patient's primary care physician may care for IBS patients, specialists in gastroenterology, immunology, psychiatry and dietary professionals may be consulted to help patients manage the condition.""

How can I prevent IBS triggers?,"'There are many different ways to help prevent triggering IBS symptoms such as:' Eat a balanced diet with a moderate amount of fiber. Avoid extremes of food temperatures (very hot or cold foods). Do not eat while experiencing anxiety or under stressful conditions (for example, while working or driving). Avoid foods and drinks that may cause dehydration or diarrhea. Keep a journal to help identify those foods that do or do not trigger symptoms. Try biofeedback, exercise, meditation, or yoga to reduce anxiety. Discuss medications you are taking that may be triggering symptoms with your doctor. Avoid those foods and drinks that are likely to increase or trigger symptoms. Avoid foods that increase intestinal gas (some legumes and vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts). Talk to your doctor or health care professional about taking probiotics."
What are the triggers for rosacea flare-ups?,"'Anything that causes your ''rosacea'' to flare up is called a trigger. Sun exposure and emotional ''stress'' are the most common triggers for ''rosacea'' flare-ups in most patients. Other triggers include the following:''Foods that can trigger ''rosacea'' include the following:''Remember that not everyone with ''rosacea'' will experience their flare-ups caused by these factors. Each person has their own set of triggering factors. What could be a trigger for you may not be the trigger for others. Hence, it is necessary to keep a watch out for things that you suspect to be setting off your ''rosacea'' flare-ups.'

What is the main cause of rosacea?,"'Rosacea'' is a chronic skin condition characterized by a flushed face and tiny ''bumps'' on the face, more commonly over your nose and cheeks. It can strike at any age of your life and is found in both the genders. However, it affects women more than men, whereas men get severe rosacea more than women.\xa0'""Doctors don't know the exact cause of rosacea. A few factors that may play a role are as follows:""'Some things make you more likely to get rosacea. These include the following:' Genes: You may get rosacea because of a particular gene that runs in your family. Trouble with facial blood vessels: A problem in your blood vessels may cause your face to appear red. If you have a light skin, the redness gets easily noticed by people. Sun damage to the blood vessels also causes rosacea. Mites: A mite known as Demodex folliculorum that is normally found on everybody’s nose and cheeks might be excess in number or cause hypersensitivity in certain people. Studies have observed that many people with rosacea harbor these mites. Bacteria: The bacteria Helicobacter pylori that infect your gut might make you more likely to get rosacea. Some studies have suggested that they increase the levels of a digestive hormone called gastrin, which might give you a flushed skin.  Antimicrobial protein: A protein that normally protects the skin from infection, cathelicidin, may give rise to rosacea. The development of rosacea depends upon how your body deals with this protein. Having a light skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes Being in your middle age (30-50 years) Female sex Having family members with rosacea Having a history of severe acne Smoking"
How to find triggers of your rosacea flare-ups?,"'It is essential to find out what triggers your rosacea flare-ups so that you:''You can use a three-step process to find out the triggers as follows:' Reduce flare-ups. Get maximum benefits from your treatment. Stop rosacea from worsening. Step one is “Discovering what could be triggering your rosacea”: You can use the list of common triggers mentioned before as a reference to identify what could trigger your rosacea. Step two is “Confirming your triggers”: After you identify what could be triggering your psoriasis flare-ups, you can maintain a rosacea diary. This diary should contain your everyday account of what you eat, what you do, and whether you have a rosacea flare-up on that day. Taking note of things that usually precede your flare-ups will help you confirm your triggers. Step three is “Making some changes”: Once you know what’s triggering your rosacea flare-ups, you can modify your lifestyle accordingly and take precautions to avoid those triggers."
How to prevent rosacea flare-ups?,"'Rosacea is a chronic skin condition that can only be controlled but cannot be cured. Hence, you have to learn to live with it peacefully. Along with the treatment, what you can do is to try to prevent its flare-ups by making some lifestyle modifications that include the following:' Protect your skin from the sun Learn to manage your stress Stay away from heat Avoid hot food and hot beverages Dial down alcoholic drinks Be careful while selecting skin and hair care products Use a makeup that suits your rosacea skin Check your medicines Protect your face from wind and cold Stay cool while exercising Get your rosacea treated from a dermatologist (skin specialist)"
LDL and HDL: What are triglycerides?,"'Triglycerides are chemical compounds digested by the body to provide it with the energy for metabolism. Triglycerides are the most common form of fat in the body. They are the main ingredient in vegetable oils and animal fats.''The triglyceride molecule is a form of the chemical glycerol (tri=three molecules of fatty acid + glyceride=glycerol) that contains three fatty acids. To be absorbed, these parts are broken apart in the small intestine, and afterwards are reassembled with ''cholesterol'' to form chylomicrons. This is the source of energy for cells in the body. Fat cells and ''liver'' cells are used as storage sites and release chylomicrons when the body needs the energy.''Elevated triglyceride levels are a risk factor for atherosclerosis, the narrowing of arteries with the buildup of fatty plaques that may lead to ''heart attack'', ''stroke'', and ''peripheral artery disease''. Markedly elevated triglyceride levels may also cause fatty ''liver disease'' and pancreatitis.''Certain diseases and conditions may cause elevated triglyceride blood levels, for example:''Alcohol'' consumption can raise triglyceride blood levels by causing the liver to produce more fatty acids. However, there are some beneficial aspects of moderate alcohol consumption, defined as one alcoholic beverage per day (a glass of wine, a bottle of beer, or an ounce of hard liquor), that may balance this triglyceride rise. Moderate alcohol consumption may mildly increase ''HDL'' (the good cholesterol) levels in the bloodstream and red wine, which contains antioxidants, may decrease the risk of ''heart disease''. ''However, it is not recommended that people start to drink alcohol to obtain these effects.' Poorly-controlled diabetes Kidney disease Cirrhosis of the liver or other liver diseases Hypothyroidism Some medications (for example, beta blockers, diuretics, birth control pills)"
How are triglyceride levels measured?,"'Triglyceride levels in the blood are measured by a simple blood test. Often, triglycerides are measured as part of a lipoprotein panel (''lipid'' panel) in which triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein), and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) are measured at the same time.''Fasting for 8-12 hours before the test is required. Fat levels in the blood are affected by recent eating and ''digestion''. Falsely elevated results may occur if the blood test is done just after eating.' "
What are normal triglyceride levels? What do elevated triglyceride levels mean?,'Elevated triglycerides place an individual at risk for atherosclerosis. Triglyceride and ''cholesterol levels'' are measured in the blood to provide a method of screening for this risk.' Normal triglyceride levels in the blood are less than 150mg per deciliter (mg/dL). Borderline levels are between 150-200 mg/dL. High levels of triglycerides (greater than 200 mg/dl) are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and therefore coronary artery disease and stroke. Extremely high triglyceride levels (greater than 500mg/dl) may cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).
What causes low triglyceride levels?,"'Returning triglyceride levels to normal may decrease the risk of ''heart'' attack, ''stroke'', and peripheral artery disease. Controlling high triglycerides and ''high cholesterol'' is a lifelong challenge. A healthy lifestyle includes eating well, exercising routinely, ''smoking cessation'', and ''weight loss''. This may be all that is needed, but some people additionally require medications to lower triglyceride levels in the blood. Your health-care professional will help make decisions with you to decide what treatment combination is most appropriate.' "
Changes in diet to lower triglycerides,"'The following dietary changes may be helpful in lowering triglycerides.''Switch to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats instead of trans or saturated fats. The best sources of these fats are olive oil, canola oil, nuts, and fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, lake trout, sardines, herring, and albacore tuna. Learning to interpret food labels will help you understand the kinds of fat in the food you buy and consume.'   Decreasing your intake of sugar: If you have a sweet tooth, try to set limits on how often and how much sugar you consume. You can cut your intake in half to begin with, and continue cutting back from there. Remember to read the labels to check for sugar content in both food and beverages. Changing from white to brown: If you eat white rice, bread, and pasta, switch to whole wheat products. It may take a little while to get used to the difference in taste, but it's worth the effort for the benefits to your health. A variety of whole-wheat products are available so experiment until you find the one that you like best. Switching fats: Limit or avoid foods with saturated and trans fats. These include fried foods, lard, butter, whole milk, ice cream, commercial baked goods, meats, and cheese. Read the nutrition labels to determine whether these unhealthy fats are present."
What is fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria)?,"'Trimethylaminuria is a disorder in which the body is unable to break down trimethylamine, a compound derived from the ''diet'' that has a strong odor of rotting fish. ' "
What are the signs and symptoms of fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria)?,"""As trimethylamine builds up in the body, it causes affected people to give off a fish-like odor in their sweat, urine, and breath. The intensity of this odor may vary over time. The strong body odor can interfere with many aspects of daily life, affecting a person's relationships, social life, and career. Some people with trimethylaminuria experience""'depression'' and social isolation as a result of this condition.'  "
What causes fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria)?,"'Although gene mutations account for most cases of trimethylaminuria, the condition can also be caused by other factors. A fish-like body odor may result from an excess of certain proteins in the diet or from an increase in bacteria that normally produce trimethylamine in the ''digestive system''. A few cases of the disorder have been identified in adults with liver or kidney disease. Temporary symptoms of this condition have been reported in a small number of premature infants and in some healthy women at the start ofmenstruation.'  "
How common is fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria)?,'Trimethylaminuria is an uncommon ''genetic disorder''; its incidence is unknown.' 
What genes are related to fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria)?,"'Mutations in the ''FMO''3 gene cause trimethylaminuria.''The FMO3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that breaks down nitrogen-containing compounds from the diet, including trimethylamine. This compound is produced by bacteria in the intestine as they help digest proteins from eggs, liver, legumes (such as soybeans and peas), certain kinds of fish, and other foods. Normally, the ''FMO3'' enzyme converts fishy-smelling trimethylamine into another molecule that has no odor. If the enzyme is missing or its activity is reduced because of a mutation in the ''FMO3'"" gene, trimethylamine is not processed properly and can build up in the body. As excess trimethylamine is released in a person's sweat, urine, and breath, it causes the strong odor characteristic of trimethylaminuria. Researchers believe that ""'stress'' and diet also play a role in triggering symptoms.' "
How do people inherit fish odor syndrome (trimethylaminuria)?,"'Most cases of trimethylaminuria appear to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Carriers of an ''FMO3'' mutation, however, may have mild symptoms of trimethylaminuria or experience temporary episodes of fish-like body odor.' "

"Facts you should know about triple-negative 
breast cancer","  Triple-negative breast cancer is an uncommon kind of breast cancer in which the cancer cells test negative for three common markers, the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and a protein involved in cell growth known as HER2. The triple-negative status of a cancer means that anti-hormonal therapies and therapies targeted against the HER2 protein are not effective. About 10%-20% of all breast cancers are triple-negative. Doctors usually treat triple-negative breast cancers with surgery, chemotherapy, and in many cases, radiation therapy. Triple-negative cancers have a more aggressive course than other breast cancers and are more likely to recur over the first few years after diagnosis. After 5 years, the likelihood of recurrence decreases. A majority of cases of breast cancer in women with a BRCA-1 mutation (inherited mutation in the breast cancer susceptibility gene-1) are triple-negative."
What is triple-negative breast cancer?,"'Breast cancer'' is a ''malignancy'' (a collection of ''cancer'' cells) arising from the cells of the breast. Triple-negative ''breast cancer'' means the ''cancer'' does not express three common markers often found on breast ''cancer'' cells: the estrogen receptor (ER), ''progesterone'' receptor (PR), and a protein involved in cell growth known as HER2. Triple-negative breast cancer makes up about 10%-20% of all breast cancers.' "
What causes triple-negative breast cancer?,"""Although there are known risk factors for the development of any kind of breast cancer, doctors do not understand the exact cause of breast cancer. Normal cells become cancer cells due to changes or mutations in the DNA. While people inherit some DNA changes, others acquire these DNA changes during a person's life."" "
What are causes and risk factors for triple-negative breast cancer?,"'The following are risk factors for any type of breast cancer, including triple-negative breast cancer:''Unlike most breast cancer, which is more common in Caucasian women, triple-negative breast cancer is more common in African-American and Hispanic women. It is also more likely to occur in younger women. About 70% of cancers that occur in women with a BRCA-1 mutation are triple-negative.' Increasing age Family history of breast cancer Personal history of breast cancer Certain kinds of benign breast disease (atypical hyperplasia) Young age at menstruation or late menopause Dense breast tissue Radiation exposure Having never given birth or giving birth for the first time after age 30 Overweight and obesity Postmenopausal hormone therapy use Alcohol consumption Genetic risk factors (BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations)"
What are triple-negative breast cancer symptoms and signs?,"'Triple-negative breast cancers may not cause any symptoms at all. When they do cause signs and symptoms, a painless ''hard mass in the breast'' is the most common sign.''Other symptoms and signs are less common and can include'   changes in the skin of the breast, lumps or masses felt in the armpit, and changes in the nipple, including inversion of the nipple and nipple discharge."
What tests and exams diagnose triple-negative breast cancer?,"'The diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer requires a sampling of tissue from the breast, known as a ''breast biopsy''. Medical professionals may perform the biopsy using imaging techniques, such as ''mammography'' or others, for guidance. If the biopsy shows cancer, they may perform other tests on the biopsy sample (or on a sample of ''tumor'' removed surgically) to determine the precise type of cancer. In particular, they commonly perform tests for expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 protein as a first step. If these tests are all negative, they classify the cancer as triple-negative breast cancer.' "
What is the staging of triple-negative breast cancer?,"'Staging is the process of determining the extent of the cancer and its spread in the body. Together with the type of cancer, staging helps determine the appropriate therapy and predict the chances for survival.''To determine if the cancer has spread, medical professionals may use several different imaging techniques, including X-ray, ''CT scans'', bone scans, and PET scans. Staging depends upon the size of a ''tumor'' and the extent to which it spread to ''lymph nodes'' or distant sites and organs in the body. Examination of ''lymph nodes'' removed at surgery and the results of ER, PR, and HER2 tests performed on the tumor tissue also help determine the stage of a tumor. Stage I is the lowest stage, while stage IV is the highest stage and refers to tumors that have metastasized, or spread to areas distant from the breast.' "
What is the treatment for triple-negative breast cancer?,"'Most doctors specifically adjust breast cancer treatments to the type of cancer and the staging group.''Many women with breast cancer will require surgery. Broadly, the surgical therapies for breast cancer consist of breast-conserving surgery (''lumpectomy'', or partial removal of the breast) and ''mastectomy'' (complete removal of the breast).''Radiation therapy'' destroys cancer cells with high-energy rays. Doctors commonly administer ''radiation'' therapy to patients after breast cancer surgery, most commonly after ''lumpectomy''.''Doctors typically recommend ''chemotherapy'' for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancers larger than 0.5 cm. Unlike cancers that express hormone receptors (ER and PR) or HER2, anti-hormonal therapy or HER2-targeted therapy is not effective. Medical professionals administer chemotherapy treatments by intravenous injection or by mouth.''Types of chemotherapy include the following:''In March 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new combination therapy for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer consisting of a combination of an immunotherapy drug and chemotherapy.'   Adjuvant chemotherapy is chemotherapy given after surgery to remove the cancer or after mastectomy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is chemotherapy given before surgery. Although there seems to be no advantage to long-term survival whether a patient receives the therapy before or after surgery, it may be advantageous in some cases to give the chemotherapy before surgery to see if the cancer responds and to shrink the cancer before surgical removal. Chemotherapy for advanced cancer: If the cancer has metastasized to distant sites in the body, chemotherapy can be used for treatment. The immunotherapy medicine atezolizumab (Tecentriq) in combination with the chemotherapy medicine Abraxane is also used for some cases of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer."
What is the survival rate (prognosis) for triple negative breast cancer?,"'Survival rates are a way to discuss the prognosis and outlook of a cancer diagnosis. The number most frequently mentioned is 5-year survival. Many patients live much longer, and some die earlier from causes other than breast cancer. With a constant change and improvement in therapies, these numbers also change. Current 5-year survival statistics are based on patients who were diagnosed at least 5 years ago and may have received different therapies than are available today.'""Below are the statistics from the National Cancer Institute's SEER database for survival of all patients with breast cancer, by tumor stage:""'Patients with triple-negative breast cancer tend to have a worse prognosis, although the American Cancer Society does not report specific survival statistics in their patient materials for people with triple-negative breast cancer. One study in 2007 showed that 77% of women with triple-negative breast cancer survived for at least 5 years, compared with 93% of women with other types of breast cancer. A 2009 study of a smaller number of patients did not show a difference in survival between the types of breast cancer. Recent research focused on looking at the group of triple-negative breast cancers to try to identify subtypes of this group that may have a more favorable prognosis. While survival rates for many people with the disease may be somewhat lower, with effective treatments, the majority of people with triple-negative breast cancer will survive without recurrence of disease.' "
What is the recurrence rate for triple negative breast cancer?," The chances that a triple-negative breast cancer will recur, or come back after treatment, are greater than with other breast cancers. This risk of recurrence is greatest at about 3 years after diagnosis. Recurrences in the early years are more likely to occur in the lungs or brain and less commonly in the bones than other types of breast cancers. However, the risk of late recurrence after 5 years is more common with other types of breast cancer and is less common for people with triple-negative cancer."
Is it possible to prevent triple-negative breast cancer?,"""There is no guaranteed way to prevent breast cancer, but modifying your lifestyle risk factors (exercising, maintaining a healthy body weight, etc.) can help decrease the risk. Following the American Cancer Society's guidelines for screening and early detection can help with identifying cancers at an early stage when treatment is most effective.""'Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should undergo genetic testing. In some cases, the use of medications or surgery may be considered for the ''prevention'' of breast cancer in high-risk women, after consultation with a health care professional and a meeting with a genetic counselor.' "
What is trisomy 18?,"'Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome, is the second most common trisomy behind ''trisomy 21'' (''Down syndrome''). It occurs in 1 in 5,000 live births and it is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 18 and similar to ''Down syndrome''. It is seen more commonly with increasing maternal age. ''Babies'' born with trisomy 18 have distinct clinical features, including developmental delay and craniofacial, limb, ''heart'', and kidney abnormalities. Half of all ''babies'' born with Edwards syndrome die within the first week, and only 5% to 10% live beyond the first year of life.' "
What causes trisomy 18? What are the different kinds of trisomy 18?,"'A trisomy is caused by a genetic error in which three copies of a chromosome (instead of two) are ''inherited'' from the parents. Trisomy 18 is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 18, and most frequently is of maternal origin and includes the entire chromosome in most cases (>90%) rather than a part of the chromosome (also known as partial trisomy or incomplete trisomy). In a small percentage of patients, an additional chromosome 18 is present in some, but not all cells, and is referred to as a mosaicism; these affected patients may not present with the typical features of Edwards syndrome listed below.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of trisomy 18?,"'Today the majority of fetuses with trisomy 18 are diagnosed prior to birth and research indicates that many of these fetuses do not survive to birth. For those infants who do survive, they are at risk for any number of abnormalities, but the typical features include:'  intrauterine growth retardation craniofacial features such as abnormalities of the jaw, skull, ears, and neck clenched fists with overriding fingers small fingernails short sternum club feet heart defects kidney defects neurodevelopmental delays"
How is trisomy 18 diagnosed?,"'Most cases of trisomy 18 are diagnosed prenatally. Standard ''pregnancy'' screening during the first and second ''trimesters'' including serum markers (plasma protein, beta-hCG, alpha-fetoprotein, unconjugated estriol, and inhibin A) with ''ultrasound'' (nuchal translucency and other anatomic abnormalities) can accurately diagnose more than three quarters of all cases. Chorionic villi sampling (CVS) is another genetic-based test that can diagnose trisomy 18. This diagnosis of trisomy 18 is important in order to better prepare parents and caregivers due to the high risk of fetal demise and early postnatal death. There are a number of support groups available to families dealing with these types of issues.'  "
What is the treatment for trisomy 18?,"'The treatment and management of children with Edwards syndrome is dependent upon the severity of findings. There is no definitive treatment for children with trisomy 18, and there are ethical issues surrounding the management of these newborns due to the high mortality rate and difficulty in predicting which infants will live beyond their first year of life. The major cause of death in many of these infants is sudden death due to neurological instability, cardiac failure, and respiratory failure. For those infants diagnosed with incomplete trisomy 18 or mosaic trisomy 18, management is focused on addressing abnormalities present since they have such a variable prognosis.' "
What is the life expectancy for someone with trisomy 18?,"'The average lifespan for infants born with trisomy 18 is 3 days to 2 weeks. Studies show that 60% to 75% of children survive for 24 hours, 20% to 60% for 1 week, 22% to 44% for 1 month, 9% to 18% for 6 months, and 5% to 10% for over 1 year. Therefore, there are quite a few affected children who require significant care and ongoing screening during their lives. Specialists in pediatric development, neurology, and genetics are often helpful with guiding the ongoing care of these children. There are great support groups such as the Support Organization for Trisomy 18, 13 and Related Disorders (SOFT) and the Trisomy 18 Foundation for parents and providers seeking guidance. In addition there is an increasing approach to management which is moving away from pure palliative care into optimizing quality of life. This is due to the increasing evidence that a collaborative model of decision making involving parents and providers is a better way to approach the child with Edwards syndrome.'  "
What is Down syndrome?,"'Down syndrome'' is a ''genetic disorder'' and the most common autosomal chromosome abnormality in humans, where extra genetic material from chromosome 21 is transferred to a newly formed embryo. These extra genes and DNA cause changes in the development of the embryo and fetus resulting in physical and mental abnormalities. Each patient is unique and there can be great variability in the severity of symptoms.'  "
What causes Down syndrome?,"'Normally, the ''human body'' has 23 pairs of chromosomes (called autosomes) and two sex chromosomes (allosomes). At ''conception'', a new cell is formed that receives one copy of each chromosome from the sperm and one copy from the egg. The new cell divides and multiplies to form an embryo and ultimately a fetus and new human. Each cell contains the exact same genetic material as the original 46 chromosomes, carrying the same genes and DNA.''In patients with Down syndrome, an error occurs in the coming together of chromosome 21. The extra genetic material is responsible for the developmental abnormalities that occur. Instead of 46 chromosomes plus two sex chromosomes, there are 47.''The most common error in chromosome replication is trisomy 21, where the new cell gets three copies of chromosome 21, instead of two. This accounts for about 95% of those patients with Down syndrome. Translocation describes a less common event where an extra piece of chromosome 21 gets attached to another chromosome, again delivering more genetic material to the new cell than is needed.'""Mosaic Down syndrome occurs when there is a combination of cells with the normal number of chromosomes (46+2) mixed together with those containing a third chromosome 21 (47+2). The cells with normal chromosomes can moderate the effect of the trisomy 21 cells and modify the effect on the patient's physical and mental development.""'Genotype is the term used to describe the genetic ''makeup'' of a person and for most Down syndrome patients, it is 47+2. Phenotype describes the physical and functional capabilities of a patient. In patients with Down syndrome there is great variability in phenotype.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of Down syndrome?,"'The baby with Down syndrome has a hallmark appearance. However, every aspect of the appearance does not need to be present as the phenotype, the way the genes make the child look, can be markedly different for each patient.''6 Common ''Down syndrome symptoms'' are:\xa0''The patient may have growth retardation and though as a baby may be normal size, will not grow as tall. The average height for an adult male with Down syndrome is 5 ft 1 in and for a female it is 4 ft 9 in. Bowleggedness is common. ''Obesity'' occurs with ''aging''.''There is decreased mental function and the IQ may range from mild disability (50 to 70) to moderate (35 to 50). For patients with Mosaic Down syndrome, IQ can be 10 to 30 points higher. There can be language development delay both from ''hearing impairment'' and speech delay. Gross motor skills like crawling and ''walking'' can be slow to mature and fine motor skills may take time to develop.'   there are a small head and short neck, a flat face, and upward slanting eyes,  ears are flat and positioned lower than “normal,” the tongue protrudes and seems to be too large for the mouth, hands tend to be wide, with short fingers and there is just a single flexion crease in the palm, and joints tend to be more flexible and muscles may lack tone."
How do doctors diagnose Down syndrome?,"'Most often, Down syndrome is diagnosed while the fetus is still in the uterus (see tests below). Routine screening is recommended by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology in all ''pregnancies'"", regardless of the mother's age.""'In the first and second ''trimesters'' of ''pregnancy'', blood tests and ''ultrasound'' may be used to screen for not only Down syndrome, but also ''spina bifida'' and other genetic abnormalities. Should these screening tests show the potential for Down syndrome, specific diagnostic test may be considered. These include the following:''There is a small risk of ''miscarriage'' with these tests. The decision as to which test might be best and when it should be done depends upon the situation and is made jointly with mother and the health care professional.''At birth, Down syndrome is usually diagnosed by the appearance of the ''newborn'' and the health care professional will likely order a chromosome analysis to confirm the diagnosis.'   Amniocentesis: A needle is placed using ultrasound guidance into the uterus to obtain a sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus. The fetus' chromosomes can be analyzed, looking for trisomy 21. Chorionic villus sampling: Cells are taken from the placenta for fetal chromosome analysis."
What is the treatment for Down syndrome?,"'Providing support and treatment for a patient with Down syndrome is meant to improve their quality of life.''Infants with Down syndrome may experience developmental delays including time to sit, crawl, walk, and talk so parents need to know that developmental delays are common in children with Down syndrome. Using a team approach to care, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists may help improve language, motor, and social skills to the maximum achievable by the individual person.''Medical conditions associated with Down syndrome, including those affecting the ''heart'' or the gastrointestinal system, may require evaluation and care, sometimes requiring surgery.''As the patient ages, the care and support needed will depend upon the intellectual ability and physical function achievable by the individual.' "
What are the potential complications of Down syndrome?,"'The extra genetic material can affect all organs in the body and complications may rise at birth or may present later in life.' Congenital heart disease may affect up to 50% of patients. Most commonly found are endocardial cushion defects (also known as atrial septal defects) and ventricular septal defects. Both are “holes” in the walls that connect the upper (atrium) and lower (ventricle) chambers of the heart. There can be many abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract, including duodenal atresia (failure for the first part of the small intestine to fully develop), imperforate anus, and Hirschsprung's disease where the nerves to the anus fail to develop appropriately. Gastroesophageal reflux is common and may lead to aspiration of stomach contents into the lungs leading to recurrent pneumonia. Celiac disease is common in Down syndrome. Common eye problems include nearsightedness, astigmatism, and strabismus (imbalanced eye muscles). Cataracts can develop in utero and lead to blindness. Glaucoma, which causes increased eye pressure, is also seen. Tear ducts may be blocked leading to recurrent eye infections. Because of the abnormal facial anatomy, recurrent ear infections are common and can lead to deafness. As well, the large tongue and smallmouth are potential risk factors for developing sleep apnea. Patients with Down syndrome are more prone to autoimmune diseases including hypothyroidism, diabetes, and celiac disease. Children are more prone to infections. Patients with Down syndrome have a higher risk to develop leukemia. There is an increased risk for cervical spine instability, especially at the atlantoaxial junction, the joint that connects the first and second vertebrae in the neck. This can potentially be dangerous should there be subluxation or excessive movement that can damage the spinal cord. Most children will require a neck X-ray only if they will be participating in sports such as the Special Olympics. Scoliosis, hip dislocations, and knee laxity are other orthopedic issues that are prevalent."
What is the prognosis for someone with Down syndrome?,"'With increased understanding of potential underlying illnesses associated with Down syndrome and with increased support within the community for patient and family, quality of life for the patient has increased in recent years. There is great variability in mental function between patients, but for those with the appropriate mental capacity, the ability to complete an education, live, and work independently.''Down syndrome patients tend to age more quickly and are prone to developing '""Alzheimer's""' disease, often as young as age 40. Those patients who maintain their mental capacity tend to have a ''longer life'' span. A poorer prognosis is found in those patients who develop ''dementia'', lose their ability to perform daily physical activities, and those who have decreased vision.' "
What is the life expectancy for someone with Down syndrome?,"'Because of the many physical complications associated with chromosomal abnormalities, many fetuses with trisomy 21 fail to develop properly and are miscarried. There is an increased risk of infant death in the first year of life because of congenital ''heart disease'' (failure of the heart to develop normally) and respiratory infections.''Given the challenges in the infant years, patients with Down syndrome have experienced increased life expectancy as recognition and treatment of underlying medical conditions improve. A person with Down syndrome can expect a life span of 50 years and more, depending upon the severity of underlying medical issues.' "
Is it possible to prevent Down syndrome?,"'Down syndrome is not an illness or disease to be prevented but instead, an unexplained error in replicating DNA, genes, and chromosomes at the earliest stages of embryo development.''There is a relationship between the age of the mother and the risk of having a child with Down syndrome. The overall frequency of a Down child is approximately 1 in 691 live births, but the older the mother, the higher the frequency. For mothers 34 years old and younger, Down syndrome frequency is 1 in 1,500 live births and the frequency gradually rises, so that for mothers older than age 45, it is 1 in 50 live births.''For couples who have a child with Down syndrome, there is increased risk to have a second child with Down syndrome. Women with Down syndrome are capable of ''becoming pregnant'' and are at increased risk of having another child with Down syndrome.' "
What is bursitis?,"'A bursa is a closed fluid-filled sac that functions as a gliding surface to reduce friction between tissues of the body. ""Bursae"" is the plural form of ""bursa."" The major bursae are located adjacent to the tendons near the large joints, such as the shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees. When a bursa becomes inflamed, the condition is known as ""bursitis.""' "
What is hip bursitis?,"'There are two major bursae of the hip, the trochanteric bursa and the ischial bursa. These are located adjacent to the edges of the femur (thighbone) and pelvic bone, respectively. Inflammation of either can be associated with ''stiffness'' and pain around the hip joint. The trochanteric bursa is located on the side of the hip. It is separated significantly from the actual hip joint by tissue and bone. Bursitis is not ''arthritis'' and, therefore, is not a cause of true ''joint pain''.'  "
What causes hip bursitis?,"'Most commonly, bursitis is a noninfectious condition (''aseptic bursitis'') caused by inflammation that results from local soft-tissue ''trauma'' or strain injury. On rare occasions, the hip bursa can become infected with bacteria. This condition is called septic bursitis. Although uncommon, the hip bursa can become inflamed by crystals that deposit there from ''gout'' or ''pseudogout'', or from calcinosis as a result of ''scleroderma''.' "
What are risk factors for hip bursitis?,"'Risk factors for hip bursitis include activities that could strain the hip area, including going up and down stairs, repetitive activities such as stair-climber exercising, etc.' "
What are hip bursitis symptoms and signs?,"'Bursitis of the hip is the most common cause of ''hip pain''.''Trochanteric bursitis frequently causes pain and tenderness of the outer hip and thigh, making it difficult for those affected to lie on the involved side, frequently causing difficult ''sleep''. Trochanteric bursitis also causes a dull, burning pain on the outer hip and thigh that is often made worse with excessive ''walking'', ''exercise'', or stair climbing. ''Iliotibial band'' syndrome can sometimes mimic or be associated with trochanteric bursitis.''Ischial bursitis''The ischial bursa is located in the upper buttock area. Ischial bursitis can cause dull pain in this area that is most noticeable when climbing uphill. The pain sometimes occurs after prolonged sitting on hard surfaces, hence the names ""weaver\'s bottom"" and ""tailor\'s bottom.""'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose hip bursitis?,"'The diagnosis of bursitis of the hip is usually based on clinical evaluation. A health care professional diagnoses hip bursitis in the clinic upon reviewing the history of the location of the hip pain and specific areas of tenderness of the outside of the hip. This can be further confirmed when a local injection of anesthetic relieves the pain. Patients frequently notice pain in the outer hip with stair climbing or descending and tenderness of the hip when lying on the affected side at night. The doctor can localize the tender areas to the location of the bursae of the hip. Occasionally, X-ray of the hip are used to rule out other conditions of the bone and joints, such as arthritis. Sometimes X-ray testing can highlight areas of calcium deposits in an inflamed bursa. These areas of calcification indicate a past history of inflammation of the bursa.' "
What types of doctors treat hip bursitis?,"'Doctors who treat hip bursitis include internists, general-medicine doctors, family medicine doctors, ''rheumatologists'', physical-medicine doctors, and orthopedic surgeons.' "
What are the treatments and home remedies for hip bursitis?,"""The treatment of any bursitis depends on whether or not it involves infection. Noninfectious or aseptic hip bursitis can be treated with home remedies that include ice compresses, rest, and anti-inflammatory and pain medications. Occasionally, it requires aspiration of the bursa fluid. This procedure involves removal of the fluid with a needle and syringe under sterile conditions. It can be performed in the doctor's office. Sometimes the fluid is sent to the laboratory for further analysis. Frequently, there is inadequate fluid accumulation for aspiration. Noninfectious hip bursitis can be treated with an injection of cortisone medication, often with an anesthetic, into the swollen bursa. ""'Cortisone injection'' is typically rapidly effective. Recovery time is usually within days. This is sometimes performed at the same time as the aspiration procedure. Home remedies include ''over-the-counter'' medications like ''naproxen'' (''Aleve''), ''ibuprofen'' (''Advil'', ''Motrin''), and ''acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'').''Patients with hip bursitis can often benefit by weight reduction, stretching exercises, and wearing proper footwear for ''exercise'' activities. Sometimes physical therapy programs guided by a physical therapist can be helpful. Generally, patients should avoid hills and stairs and direct pressure on the affected hip (''sleep'' on the other side), when possible, while symptoms are present. People with hip bursitis should also avoid exercising on inclined surfaces and stairs, especially ''running'' hills, until symptoms have resolved. Other exercises to avoid until the hip inflammation has subsided include Stairmaster and similar exercises.''Infectious (septic) bursitis (rare in the hip) requires even further evaluation and treatment by a doctor. This is unusual in the hip bursa but does occur. The bursa fluid can be examined in the laboratory to identify the precise bacteria causing the infection. Septic bursitis requires antibiotic therapy, often intravenously. Repeated aspiration of the infected fluid may be required. Surgical drainage and removal of the infected bursa sac (bursectomy) may also be necessary.'  "
What is the prognosis for hip bursitis? Is it possible to prevent hip bursitis?,"'Usually, hip bursitis responds completely with conservative treatments. Either oral or injectable anti-inflammatory medications frequently resolve the symptoms within a week. Treatment by a physical therapist can expedite recovery in resistant hip bursitis. Infectious bursitis must be cured with antibiotic treatment, often together with surgical drainage.''Hip bursitis can often be prevented by stretching prior to exercising and by wearing proper footwear for activities. ''Yoga'' can be helpful. Avoiding hills and stairs can minimize the risk of hip bursitis.'  "
What is the pancreas?,"'The pancreas is an organ approximately six inches long that is located in the abdomen behind the stomach and in front of the spine and ''aorta''. The pancreas is divided into three regions: the head, the body, and the tail. The head of the pancreas is located on the right side of the abdomen adjacent to the duodenum. The tail is on the left side of the abdomen, and the body lies between the head and the tail.''There are two functional parts to the pancreas, referred to as the exocrine and endocrine parts. The majority of the cells of the pancreas produce digestive juices which contain the enzymes necessary for digesting food in the intestine. The enzymes are secreted into smaller collecting ducts within the pancreas (side branches). The side branches empty into a larger duct, the main pancreatic duct, which empties into the intestine through the papilla of Vater in the duodenum. During passage through the ducts, bicarbonate is added to the ''digestive enzymes'' to make the pancreatic secretion alkaline. The cells and ducts producing the digestive juices comprise the exocrine part of the pancreas.''Just before the main pancreatic duct enters the duodenum, it usually merges with the common bile duct that collects bile (a fluid that helps to digest fat) produced by the ''liver''. The common bile duct usually joins the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas. The union of these two ducts forms the ampulla of Vater which drains both the bile and pancreatic fluid into the duodenum through the papilla of Vater.''Buried within the tissue of the pancreas, primarily in the head, are small collections of cells, termed the Islets of Langerhans. The cells of the Islets produce several hormones, for example, ''insulin'', glucagon, and somatostatin; that are released into the blood (the islets do not connect with the pancreatic ducts) and travel in the blood to other parts of the body. These hormones have effects throughout the body, for example, insulin, which helps to regulate blood ''sugar'' levels. The hormone-secreting portion of the pancreas -- the Islets -- is the endocrine part of the pancreas.' "
What are pancreatic cysts?,"'Pancreatic ''cysts'' are collections (pools) of fluid that can form within the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. Some pancreatic cysts are true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts), that is, they are lined by a special layer of cells that are responsible for secreting fluid into the cysts. Other cysts are pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and do not contain specialized lining cells. Often these pseudocysts contain pancreatic digestive juices because they are connected to the pancreatic ducts. Pancreatic cysts can range in size from several millimeters to several centimeters. Many pancreatic cysts are small and benign and produce no symptoms, but some cysts become large and cause symptoms, and others are cancerous or ''precancerous''. (Precancerous cysts are benign cysts that have the potential to become cancerous.)''Different types of cysts contain different types of fluids. For example, pseudocysts that form after an attack of ''acute pancreatitis'' contain digestive enzymes, such as amylase, in high concentrations. Mucinous cysts contain ''mucus'' (a proteinaceous liquid) produced by the mucinous cells that form the inside lining of the ''cyst''.' "
What are the symptoms of pancreatic cysts?,"   The symptoms of pancreatic cysts depend on their size and location. Small (less than two cm) cysts usually cause no symptoms. Large pancreatic cysts can cause
	abdominal pain and 
	back pain presumably by exerting pressure on the surrounding tissues and nerves. 
	 Small or large cysts in the head of the pancreas also may cause
	jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes with 
	darkening of 
	the urine) due to obstruction of the common bile duct. (Obstruction causes bile to back up and forces bilirubin--the chemical that produces jaundice--back into the bloodstream 
	and forces it to be excreted in the urine.) 
	 If the cysts become infected, it may result in
	fever, 
	chills, and 
	sepsis.  
	 On rare occasions, large pseudocysts can compress the stomach or the duodenum leading to obstruction  
	to the movement of food in the intestines, resulting in abdominal pain and
	vomiting. 
	 If a cyst becomes malignant and begins to invade the surrounding tissues, it may lead to the same type of pain as 
	pancreatic cancer, pain that usually is constant and felt in the back and upper abdomen.
	"
"What are the causes of 
pancreatic cysts?","'There are two major types of pancreatic cysts; pseudocysts (inflammatory cysts) and true cysts (non-inflammatory cysts). Inflammatory cysts are benign, whereas non-inflammatory cysts can be benign, precancerous, or cancerous.'  "
Pseudocysts,"'Most of the inflammatory cysts of the pancreas are pancreatic pseudocysts. Pseudocysts of the pancreas result from ''pancreatitis'' (inflammation of the pancreas). The common causes of pancreatitis include ''alcoholism'', ''gallstones'', ''trauma'', and surgery. The fluid inside the pseudocysts represents liquefied dead pancreatic tissue, cells of inflammation, and a high concentration of digestive enzymes  that are present in pancreatic exocrine secretions. (Most pseudocysts have connections with the pancreatic ducts.) Most pseudocysts caused by acute pancreatitis resolve spontaneously (without treatment) within several weeks. Pseudocysts that need treatment are those that persist beyond six weeks and are causing symptoms such as pain, obstruction of the stomach or duodenum, or have become infected. ' "
True cysts," Serous cyst adenomas: These cysts are mostly benign and commonly occur in middle-aged women. They usually are located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Typically, they are small and cause no symptoms although rarely they may cause abdominal pain. Mucinous cyst adenomas: Thirty percent of these cysts contain cancer, and those that do not contain cancer are considered precancerous. They also commonly occur in middle-aged women and are usually located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): These cysts have a high likelihood of being or becoming cancerous. At the time of diagnosis, there is a 45% to 65% chance of the cyst already being cancerous. These cysts are more common in middle-aged men and are more commonly located in the head of the pancreas. The cysts typically produce large amounts of mucous which sometimes can be seen draining out of the papilla of Vater at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), a test that visualizes the ampulla of Vater and the pancreatic duct. These cysts can cause abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. Increased risk for cancer occurs with older age of the patient, presence of symptoms, involvement of the main pancreatic duct, dilation of the main pancreatic duct over 10 mm, the presence of nodules in the wall of the duodenum, and size over 3 cm for side-branch IPMN. Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas: These are rare tumors that have both solid and cystic components and are found mainly in young Asian and black women. They may reach a large size and can become malignant. Prognosis is excellent after complete surgical resection of these tumors."
How do medical professionals diagnose pancreatic cysts?,"'Since the majority of pancreatic cysts are small and produce no symptoms, they often are discovered incidentally when abdominal scans (''ultrasound'' [US], ''computerized tomography'' or CT, ''magnetic resonance imaging'' or ''MRI'') are performed to investigate unrelated symptoms. Unfortunately, ultrasound, CT, and MRI cannot reliably distinguish benign cysts (cysts that usually need no treatment) from precancerous and cancerous cysts (cysts that usually require surgical removal).''Endoscopic ultrasound'' (EUS) is becoming increasingly useful in determining whether a pancreatic cyst is likely to be benign, precancerous, or cancerous. During endoscopic ultrasound, an endoscope with a small ultrasound transducer at its tip is inserted into the mouth and is passed through the\xa0''esophagus''\xa0and stomach into the duodenum. From this location, which is very close to the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, accurate and detailed images can be obtained of the liver, pancreas and the gallbladder.''During endoscopic ultrasound, fluid from cysts and samples of tissue also can be obtained by passing special needles through the endoscope and into the cysts. The process of obtaining tissue or fluid with a thin needle is called fine needle aspiration (FNA).''The fluid obtained by FNA can be analyzed for cancerous cells (cytology), amylase content, and for tumor markers. Tumor markers, such as CEA (''carcinoembryonic antigen''), are proteins produced in large quantities by cancer cells. For example, pancreatic pseudocyst fluid will typically have high amylase levels but low CEA levels. A benign serous cyst adenoma will have low amylase and low CEA levels, whereas a precancerous or cancerous mucinous cyst adenoma will have low amylase levels but high CEA levels. Most recently, DNA from cells that are aspirated from the cyst has been analyzed for changes suggestive of cancer.''The risks of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration are small and consist of a very small incidence of bleeding and infection.''Occasionally, it is difficult even with the diagnostic tools of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration to determine if a pancreatic cyst is cancerous or precancerous. If the answer is not clear, sometimes repeated endoscopic ultrasound and aspiration are done if the suspicion for cancer or precancer is high. In other cases, the cyst is reexamined by CT, MRI, or even endoscopic ultrasound after a few months to detect changes that more strongly suggest that cancer has developed. In still others, surgery is recommended.'  "
What is the treatment for pancreatic cysts?,"'The most important aspect of management of pancreatic cysts is the determination of whether a cyst is benign (and usually needs no treatment) or if it is precancerous or cancerous and must be removed.''The second most important aspect of management is to determine whether a patient with a precancerous or cancerous pancreatic cyst is a suitable surgical candidate. In medical centers experienced in performing pancreatic surgery, surgical removal of precancerous or cancerous cysts results in a high rate of cure.'""Very small cysts can be followed to detect an increase in size that may indicate cancer or an increased risk of developing cancer.\xa0Management decisions must be individualized for each patient after discussions with a doctor familiar with the patient's health status. The following are examples of how a doctor might manage pancreatic cysts.""   Pancreatic pseudocysts need treatment if they persist beyond six weeks after acute pancreatitis, especially if they reach a large size and cause symptoms such as obstruction of the stomach or common bile duct, abdominal pain, or become infected. Small pancreatic cysts (for example, cysts smaller than one cm) will have little chance of being cancerous. Nevertheless, even these small cysts can grow in size and turn cancerous in the future. Thus, these patients are monitored with yearly scans (for example, yearly ultrasound or MRI). The cysts do not have to be evaluated with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If the cysts grow in size and/or cause symptoms, the patient will be evaluated further using endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. Pancreatic cysts larger than 3 cm can be studied with endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration. If fluid cytology, CEA measurements or analysis of DNA suggest cancerous or precancerous changes, the patients can be evaluated for pancreatic surgery."
Tips for trying to conceive*,"'*Trying to conceive facts medically edited by: Melissa Conrad Stöppler, MD''This article offers tips for those desiring to have a baby, offers advice on what to do when trying to conceive to determine your fertile period, and discusses options for those who are having trouble conceiving.'   If you are trying to get pregnant (conceive), you have the best chance of success if you are aware of your menstrual cycle and changes that happen to your body during that time. It helps to know when you are fertile and able to get pregnant. A woman’s fertile time is usually a few days per month in the middle of her menstrual cycle and represents the time when a woman ovulates. There are three ways to track your fertile times: 1) basal body temperature method, 2) calendar method, and 3) cervical mucus method (ovulation method). Many women experience miscarriages or pregnancy losses, or cannot conceive at all (infertility). Infertility in women can be caused by age, health problems (like PCOS), uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and pelvic inflammatory disease, and negative lifestyle factors. Infertility in men may be caused infertility in men are sperm gene defects, negative lifestyle choices (alcohol and drugs), toxins (lead, pesticides), STDs, diabetes, and prostate or testicle problems. There are several treatment options for infertile couples including drugs, surgery, intrauterine insemination (artificial insemination), assisted reproductive technology, third party assistance, adoption, and foster care."
When can a woman get pregnant during her menstrual cycle?,"'Being aware of your menstrual cycle and the changes in your body that happen during this time can help you know when you are most likely to get pregnant. See how the menstrual cycle works.''The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days. But normal cycles can vary from 21 to 35 days. The amount of time before ovulation occurs is different in every woman and even can be different from month to month in the same woman, varying from 13 to 20 days long. Learning about this part of the cycle is important because it is when ovulation and pregnancy can occur. After ovulation, every woman (unless she has a health problem that affects her periods or becomes pregnant) will have a period within 14 to 16 days.'""Knowing when you're most fertile will help you plan or prevent pregnancy. There are three ways you can keep track of your fertile times. They are the: 1) basal body temperature method; 2) calendar method; and 3) ovulation method (cervical mucus method).""  "
Taking your temperature to conceive,"""Basal body temperature is your temperature at rest as soon as you awake in the morning. A woman's basal body temperature rises slightly with ovulation. So by recording this temperature daily for several months, you'll be able to predict your most fertile days.""'Basal body temperature differs slightly from woman to woman. Anywhere from 96 to 98 degrees Fahrenheit orally is average before ovulation. After ovulation most women have an oral temperature between 97 and 99 degrees Fahrenheit. The rise in temperature can be a sudden jump or a gradual climb over a few days.'""Usually a woman's basal body temperature rises by only 0.4 to 0.8 degrees Fahrenheit. To detect this tiny change, women must use a basal body thermometer. These thermometers are very sensitive. Most pharmacies sell them for about $10.""""The rise in temperature doesn't show exactly when the egg is released. But almost all women have ovulated within three days after their temperatures spike. Body temperature stays at the higher level until your period starts.""'You are most fertile and most likely to get pregnant:'""A man's sperm can live for up to three days in a woman's body. The sperm can fertilize an egg at any point during that time. So if you have unprotected sex a few days before ovulation, you could get pregnant.""'Many things can affect basal body temperature. For your chart to be useful, make sure to take your temperature every morning at about the same time. Things that can alter your temperature include:''Drinking alcohol the night before' Two to three days before your temperature hits the highest point (ovulation) 12 to 24 hours after ovulation Smoking cigarettes the night before Getting a poor night's sleep Having a fever Doing anything in the morning before you take your temperature - including going to the bathroom and talking on the phone"
Using the calendar method to conceive,"'This involves recording your menstrual cycle on a calendar for eight to 12 months. The first day of your period is Day 1. Circle Day 1 on the calendar. The length of your cycle may vary from month to month. So write down the total number of days it lasts each time. Using this record, you can find the days you are most fertile in the months ahead:''This method always should be used along with other ''fertility awareness'' methods, especially if your cycles are not always the same length.' To find out the first day when you are most fertile, subtract 18 from the total number of days in your shortest cycle. Take this new number and count ahead that many days from the first day of your next period. Draw an X through this date on your calendar. The X marks the first day you're likely to be fertile. To find out the last day when you are most fertile, subtract 11 from the total number of days in your longest cycle. Take this new number and count ahead that many days from the first day of your next period. Draw an X through this date on your calendar. The time between the two Xs is your most fertile window."
Using the ovulation method to conceive,"'The cervical mucus method (also known as the ovulation method) involves being aware of the changes in your cervical mucus throughout the month. The hormones that control the menstrual cycle also change the kind and amount of mucus you have before and during ovulation. Right after your period, there are usually a few days when there is no mucus present or ""dry days."" As the egg starts to mature, mucus increases in the vagina, appears at the vaginal opening, and is white or yellow and cloudy and sticky. The greatest amount of mucus appears just before ovulation. During these ""wet days"" it becomes clear and slippery, like raw egg whites. Sometimes it can be stretched apart. This is when you are most fertile. About four days after the wet days begin the mucus changes again. There will be much less and it becomes sticky and cloudy. You might have a few more dry days before your period returns. Describe changes in your mucus on a calendar. Label the days, ""Sticky,"" ""Dry,"" or ""Wet."" You are most fertile at the first sign of wetness after your period or a day or two before wetness begins.''The cervical mucus method is less reliable for some women. Women who are ''breastfeeding'', taking hormonal ''birth control'' (like ''the pill''), using feminine hygiene products, have ''vaginitis'' or sexually transmitted infections (STIs or ''STDs''), or have had surgery on the cervix should not rely on this method.' "
When to see your doctor if you are having problems getting pregnant,"'Happily, doctors are able to help many ''infertile'' couples go on to have ''babies''.' You are younger than 35 and have not been able to conceive after one year of frequent sex without birth control. You are age 35 or older and have not been able to conceive after six months of frequent sex without birth control. You believe you or your partner might have fertility problems in the future (even before you begin trying to get pregnant). You or your partner has a problem with sexual function or libido."
What is infertility?,"'Some women want children but either cannot conceive or keep miscarrying. This is called infertility. Lots of couples have infertility problems. About one-third of the time, it is a female problem. In another one-third of cases, it is the man with the fertility problem. For the remaining one-third, both partners have fertility challenges or no cause is found.' "
What causes of infertility in women?,"'Some common reasons for infertility in women include:''Age:'"" Women generally have some decrease in fertility starting in their early 30s. And while many women in their 30s and 40s have no problems getting pregnant, fertility especially declines after age 35. As a woman ages, normal changes that occur in her ovaries and eggs make it harder to become pregnant. Even though menstrual cycles continue to be regular in a woman's 30s and 40s, the eggs that ovulate each month are of poorer quality than those from her 20s. It is harder to get pregnant when the eggs are poorer in quality. As a woman nears ""'menopause'', the ovaries may not release an egg each month, which also can make it harder to get pregnant. Also, as a woman and her eggs age, she is more likely to miscarry, as well as have a baby with genetic problems, such as ''Down syndrome''.''Health problems:'' Some women have diseases or conditions that affect their hormone levels, which can cause infertility.''Polycystic ovay syndrome (''PCOS'')'': Women with PCOS rarely or never ovulate. Failure to ovulate is the most common cause of infertility in women.''With ''primary ovarian insufficiency'"" (POI), a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40. It is not the same as early ""'menopause''. Some women with POI get a period now and then. But getting pregnant is hard for women with POI.''A condition called luteal phase defect (LPD) is a failure of the uterine lining to be fully prepared for pregnancy. This can keep a fertilized egg from implanting or result in ''miscarriage''.''Reproductive problems:'"" Common problems with a woman's reproductive organs, like ""'uterine fibroids'', ''endometriosis'', and ''pelvic inflammatory disease'"" (PID) can worsen with age and also affect fertility. These conditions might cause the fallopian tubes to be blocked, so the egg can't travel through the tubes into the uterus.""'Lifestyle factors:'"" Certain lifestyle factors also can have a negative effect on a woman's fertility. Examples include ""'smoking'', alcohol use, weighing much more or much less than an ideal body weight, a lot of strenuous ''exercise'', and having an eating disorder. ''Stress'' also can affect fertility.'  "
What causes infertility in men?,"""Unlike women, some men remain fertile into their 60s and 70s. But as men age, they might begin to have problems with the shape and movement of their sperm. They also have a slightly higher risk of sperm gene defects. Or they might produce no sperm, or too few sperm. Lifestyle choices also can affect the number and quality of a man's sperm. Alcohol and drugs can temporarily reduce sperm quality. And researchers are looking at whether environmental toxins, such as pesticides and lead, also may be to blame for some cases of infertility. Men also can have health problems that affect their sexual and reproductive function. These can include sexually transmitted infections (STIs), ""'diabetes'', surgery on the ''prostate gland'', or a severe testicle injury or problem.'  "
What is the treatment for infertility?,"'If you are having fertility issues, your doctor can refer you to a fertility specialist, a doctor who treats infertility. The doctor will need to test both you and your partner to find out what the problem is. Depending on the problem, your doctor might recommend treatment. About 9 in 10 cases of infertility are treated with drugs or surgery. '""Don't delay seeing your doctor as age also affects the success rates of these treatments. ""'For some couples, adoption or foster care offers a way to share their love with a child and to build a family.''Some treatments include:''Drugs:'"" Various fertility drugs may be used for women with ovulation problems. It is important to talk with your doctor about the drug to be used. You should understand the drug's benefits and side effects. Depending on the type of fertility drug and the dosage of the drug used, multiple births (such as twins) can occur.""'Surgery:'"" Surgery is done to repair damage to a woman's ovaries, fallopian tubes, or uterus. Sometimes a man has an infertility problem that can be corrected by surgery.""'Intrauterine insemination (IUI, artificial insemination):'"" Male sperm is injected into part of the woman's reproductive tract, such as into the uterus or fallopian tube. IUI often is used along with drugs that cause a woman to ovulate.""'Assisted reproductive technology (ART):'"" ART involves stimulating a woman's ovaries; removing eggs from her body; mixing them with sperm in the laboratory; and putting the embryos back into a woman's body. Success rates of ART vary and depend on many factors.""'Third party assistance:'' Options include donor eggs (eggs from another woman are used), donor sperm (sperm from another man are used), or surrogacy (when another woman carries a baby for you).''Finding the cause of infertility is often a long, complex, and emotional process. And treatment can be expensive. Many health insurance companies do not provide coverage for infertility or provide only limited coverage. Check your health insurance contract carefully to learn about what is covered. Some states have laws that mandate health insurance policies to provide infertility coverage.'  "
What other options are available if a couple can't conceive?,"""If infertility is a problem for you, another option may be adoption. Adopting a baby or child can be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life. So many babies, children, and adolescents in the United States and around the world need a family. Some of these are healthy infants, and many are children with special needs, including physical, emotional, or mental disabilities. If you do adopt a child with special needs, there are both federal and state sources of financial assistance available to help you afford the child's care.""'There are two types of adoptions:''The laws of each state differ on whether, after a period of time, the files of a closed adoption can be opened later to reveal this information. State laws also differ on whether adoptions can be handled by an adoption agency or independently (such as through a doctor, lawyer, counselor or independent organization). Most adoption agencies carefully screen and study the adoptive parents. You can learn more about adoption through the resources at the end of this section.''Another option for couples who have a lot of love to share with a child is foster care. Unlike adoption, foster care is a temporary service that responds to crises in the lives of children and families. But it also can be the first step to adopting a child. Many foster children have been abused or neglected, or removed by a court order. Foster families are people who take these children into their homes to provide day-to-day care and nurturing. Children in foster care may live with unrelated foster parents, with relatives, with families who plan to adopt them, or in group homes or residential treatment centers. Even though foster care is viewed as a temporary service, many children have to stay in foster care for long periods of time.''Each child in foster care should have a plan that will let him or her grow up in a permanent family. For many children, the plan is to return to the birth parents. In these cases, foster families may work with the birth parents and the child to help them both learn the skills they need to live together again. Foster parents need to be able to love the children who live in their home, and let go of them when it is time to send them back to their parents. For other children, going back to their parents will not be possible, and the foster parents may become adoptive parents. Or they can keep other kinds of formal or informal ties with the children they parent.''Every state has its own rules about foster ''parenting''. But, the chances are good that you can be a foster parent in your state. There are many more children in need of care than there are foster parents available. To fill this gap, states are looking for people who want to help children and can share their time and their homes. States also give foster parents many different forms of support, like training and financial assistance.'  Open adoption: The birth mother, and possibly the birth father, know something about the adoptive parents. They might even meet and exchange names or addresses. Closed adoption: The birth mother and adoptive parents do not meet each other or know each others' names."
Counseling and support groups for help ,"""If you've been having problems getting pregnant, you know how frustrating it can feel. Not being able to get pregnant can be one of the most stressful experiences a couple has. Both counseling and support groups can help you and your partner talk about your feelings and help you meet other couples struggling with the same issues. You will learn that anger, ""'grief'', blame, guilt, and ''depression'' are all normal. Couples do survive infertility, and can become closer and stronger in the process.

If you are trying to get pregnant (conceive), you have the best chance of success if you are aware of your menstrual cycle and changes that happen to your body during that time. It helps to know when you are fertile and able to get pregnant. A woman’s fertile time is usually a few days per month in the middle of her menstrual cycle and represents the time when a woman ovulates. There are three ways to track your fertile times: 1) basal body temperature method, 2) calendar method, and 3) cervical mucus method (ovulation method). Many women experience miscarriages or pregnancy losses, or cannot conceive at all (infertility). Infertility in women can be caused by age, health problems (like PCOS), uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and pelvic inflammatory disease, and negative lifestyle factors. Infertility in men may be caused infertility in men are sperm gene defects, negative lifestyle choices (alcohol and drugs), toxins (lead, pesticides), STDs, diabetes, and prostate or testicle problems. There are several treatment options for infertile couples including drugs, surgery, intrauterine insemination (artificial insemination), assisted reproductive technology, third party assistance, adoption, and foster care."
When can a woman get pregnant during her menstrual cycle?,"'Being aware of your menstrual cycle and the changes in your body that happen during this time can help you know when you are most likely to get pregnant. See how the menstrual cycle works.''The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days. But normal cycles can vary from 21 to 35 days. The amount of time before ovulation occurs is different in every woman and even can be different from month to month in the same woman, varying from 13 to 20 days long. Learning about this part of the cycle is important because it is when ovulation and pregnancy can occur. After ovulation, every woman (unless she has a health problem that affects her periods or becomes pregnant) will have a period within 14 to 16 days.'""Knowing when you're most fertile will help you plan or prevent pregnancy. There are three ways you can keep track of your fertile times. They are the: 1) basal body temperature method; 2) calendar method; and 3) ovulation method (cervical mucus method).""  "
Taking your temperature to conceive,"""Basal body temperature is your temperature at rest as soon as you awake in the morning. A woman's basal body temperature rises slightly with ovulation. So by recording this temperature daily for several months, you'll be able to predict your most fertile days.""'Basal body temperature differs slightly from woman to woman. Anywhere from 96 to 98 degrees Fahrenheit orally is average before ovulation. After ovulation most women have an oral temperature between 97 and 99 degrees Fahrenheit. The rise in temperature can be a sudden jump or a gradual climb over a few days.'""Usually a woman's basal body temperature rises by only 0.4 to 0.8 degrees Fahrenheit. To detect this tiny change, women must use a basal body thermometer. These thermometers are very sensitive. Most pharmacies sell them for about $10.""""The rise in temperature doesn't show exactly when the egg is released. But almost all women have ovulated within three days after their temperatures spike. Body temperature stays at the higher level until your period starts.""'You are most fertile and most likely to get pregnant:'""A man's sperm can live for up to three days in a woman's body. The sperm can fertilize an egg at any point during that time. So if you have unprotected sex a few days before ovulation, you could get pregnant.""'Many things can affect basal body temperature. For your chart to be useful, make sure to take your temperature every morning at about the same time. Things that can alter your temperature include:''Drinking alcohol the night before' Two to three days before your temperature hits the highest point (ovulation) 12 to 24 hours after ovulation Smoking cigarettes the night before Getting a poor night's sleep Having a fever Doing anything in the morning before you take your temperature - including going to the bathroom and talking on the phone"
Using the calendar method to conceive,"'This involves recording your menstrual cycle on a calendar for eight to 12 months. The first day of your period is Day 1. Circle Day 1 on the calendar. The length of your cycle may vary from month to month. So write down the total number of days it lasts each time. Using this record, you can find the days you are most fertile in the months ahead:''This method always should be used along with other ''fertility awareness'' methods, especially if your cycles are not always the same length.' To find out the first day when you are most fertile, subtract 18 from the total number of days in your shortest cycle. Take this new number and count ahead that many days from the first day of your next period. Draw an X through this date on your calendar. The X marks the first day you're likely to be fertile. To find out the last day when you are most fertile, subtract 11 from the total number of days in your longest cycle. Take this new number and count ahead that many days from the first day of your next period. Draw an X through this date on your calendar. The time between the two Xs is your most fertile window."
Using the ovulation method to conceive,"'The cervical mucus method (also known as the ovulation method) involves being aware of the changes in your cervical mucus throughout the month. The hormones that control the menstrual cycle also change the kind and amount of mucus you have before and during ovulation. Right after your period, there are usually a few days when there is no mucus present or ""dry days."" As the egg starts to mature, mucus increases in the vagina, appears at the vaginal opening, and is white or yellow and cloudy and sticky. The greatest amount of mucus appears just before ovulation. During these ""wet days"" it becomes clear and slippery, like raw egg whites. Sometimes it can be stretched apart. This is when you are most fertile. About four days after the wet days begin the mucus changes again. There will be much less and it becomes sticky and cloudy. You might have a few more dry days before your period returns. Describe changes in your mucus on a calendar. Label the days, ""Sticky,"" ""Dry,"" or ""Wet."" You are most fertile at the first sign of wetness after your period or a day or two before wetness begins.''The cervical mucus method is less reliable for some women. Women who are ''breastfeeding'', taking hormonal ''birth control'' (like ''the pill''), using feminine hygiene products, have ''vaginitis'' or sexually transmitted infections (STIs or ''STDs''), or have had surgery on the cervix should not rely on this method.' "
When to see your doctor if you are having problems getting pregnant,"'Happily, doctors are able to help many ''infertile'' couples go on to have ''babies''.' You are younger than 35 and have not been able to conceive after one year of frequent sex without birth control. You are age 35 or older and have not been able to conceive after six months of frequent sex without birth control. You believe you or your partner might have fertility problems in the future (even before you begin trying to get pregnant). You or your partner has a problem with sexual function or libido."
What is infertility?,"'Some women want children but either cannot conceive or keep miscarrying. This is called infertility. Lots of couples have infertility problems. About one-third of the time, it is a female problem. In another one-third of cases, it is the man with the fertility problem. For the remaining one-third, both partners have fertility challenges or no cause is found.' "
What causes of infertility in women?,"'Some common reasons for infertility in women include:''Age:'"" Women generally have some decrease in fertility starting in their early 30s. And while many women in their 30s and 40s have no problems getting pregnant, fertility especially declines after age 35. As a woman ages, normal changes that occur in her ovaries and eggs make it harder to become pregnant. Even though menstrual cycles continue to be regular in a woman's 30s and 40s, the eggs that ovulate each month are of poorer quality than those from her 20s. It is harder to get pregnant when the eggs are poorer in quality. As a woman nears ""'menopause'', the ovaries may not release an egg each month, which also can make it harder to get pregnant. Also, as a woman and her eggs age, she is more likely to miscarry, as well as have a baby with genetic problems, such as ''Down syndrome''.''Health problems:'' Some women have diseases or conditions that affect their hormone levels, which can cause infertility.''Polycystic ovay syndrome (''PCOS'')'': Women with PCOS rarely or never ovulate. Failure to ovulate is the most common cause of infertility in women.''With ''primary ovarian insufficiency'"" (POI), a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40. It is not the same as early ""'menopause''. Some women with POI get a period now and then. But getting pregnant is hard for women with POI.''A condition called luteal phase defect (LPD) is a failure of the uterine lining to be fully prepared for pregnancy. This can keep a fertilized egg from implanting or result in ''miscarriage''.''Reproductive problems:'"" Common problems with a woman's reproductive organs, like ""'uterine fibroids'', ''endometriosis'', and ''pelvic inflammatory disease'"" (PID) can worsen with age and also affect fertility. These conditions might cause the fallopian tubes to be blocked, so the egg can't travel through the tubes into the uterus.""'Lifestyle factors:'"" Certain lifestyle factors also can have a negative effect on a woman's fertility. Examples include ""'smoking'', alcohol use, weighing much more or much less than an ideal body weight, a lot of strenuous ''exercise'', and having an eating disorder. ''Stress'' also can affect fertility.'  "
What causes infertility in men?,"""Unlike women, some men remain fertile into their 60s and 70s. But as men age, they might begin to have problems with the shape and movement of their sperm. They also have a slightly higher risk of sperm gene defects. Or they might produce no sperm, or too few sperm. Lifestyle choices also can affect the number and quality of a man's sperm. Alcohol and drugs can temporarily reduce sperm quality. And researchers are looking at whether environmental toxins, such as pesticides and lead, also may be to blame for some cases of infertility. Men also can have health problems that affect their sexual and reproductive function. These can include sexually transmitted infections (STIs), ""'diabetes'', surgery on the ''prostate gland'', or a severe testicle injury or problem.'  "
What is the treatment for infertility?,"'If you are having fertility issues, your doctor can refer you to a fertility specialist, a doctor who treats infertility. The doctor will need to test both you and your partner to find out what the problem is. Depending on the problem, your doctor might recommend treatment. About 9 in 10 cases of infertility are treated with drugs or surgery. '""Don't delay seeing your doctor as age also affects the success rates of these treatments. ""'For some couples, adoption or foster care offers a way to share their love with a child and to build a family.''Some treatments include:''Drugs:'"" Various fertility drugs may be used for women with ovulation problems. It is important to talk with your doctor about the drug to be used. You should understand the drug's benefits and side effects. Depending on the type of fertility drug and the dosage of the drug used, multiple births (such as twins) can occur.""'Surgery:'"" Surgery is done to repair damage to a woman's ovaries, fallopian tubes, or uterus. Sometimes a man has an infertility problem that can be corrected by surgery.""'Intrauterine insemination (IUI, artificial insemination):'"" Male sperm is injected into part of the woman's reproductive tract, such as into the uterus or fallopian tube. IUI often is used along with drugs that cause a woman to ovulate.""'Assisted reproductive technology (ART):'"" ART involves stimulating a woman's ovaries; removing eggs from her body; mixing them with sperm in the laboratory; and putting the embryos back into a woman's body. Success rates of ART vary and depend on many factors.""'Third party assistance:'' Options include donor eggs (eggs from another woman are used), donor sperm (sperm from another man are used), or surrogacy (when another woman carries a baby for you).''Finding the cause of infertility is often a long, complex, and emotional process. And treatment can be expensive. Many health insurance companies do not provide coverage for infertility or provide only limited coverage. Check your health insurance contract carefully to learn about what is covered. Some states have laws that mandate health insurance policies to provide infertility coverage.'  "
What other options are available if a couple can't conceive?,"""If infertility is a problem for you, another option may be adoption. Adopting a baby or child can be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life. So many babies, children, and adolescents in the United States and around the world need a family. Some of these are healthy infants, and many are children with special needs, including physical, emotional, or mental disabilities. If you do adopt a child with special needs, there are both federal and state sources of financial assistance available to help you afford the child's care.""'There are two types of adoptions:''The laws of each state differ on whether, after a period of time, the files of a closed adoption can be opened later to reveal this information. State laws also differ on whether adoptions can be handled by an adoption agency or independently (such as through a doctor, lawyer, counselor or independent organization). Most adoption agencies carefully screen and study the adoptive parents. You can learn more about adoption through the resources at the end of this section.''Another option for couples who have a lot of love to share with a child is foster care. Unlike adoption, foster care is a temporary service that responds to crises in the lives of children and families. But it also can be the first step to adopting a child. Many foster children have been abused or neglected, or removed by a court order. Foster families are people who take these children into their homes to provide day-to-day care and nurturing. Children in foster care may live with unrelated foster parents, with relatives, with families who plan to adopt them, or in group homes or residential treatment centers. Even though foster care is viewed as a temporary service, many children have to stay in foster care for long periods of time.''Each child in foster care should have a plan that will let him or her grow up in a permanent family. For many children, the plan is to return to the birth parents. In these cases, foster families may work with the birth parents and the child to help them both learn the skills they need to live together again. Foster parents need to be able to love the children who live in their home, and let go of them when it is time to send them back to their parents. For other children, going back to their parents will not be possible, and the foster parents may become adoptive parents. Or they can keep other kinds of formal or informal ties with the children they parent.''Every state has its own rules about foster ''parenting''. But, the chances are good that you can be a foster parent in your state. There are many more children in need of care than there are foster parents available. To fill this gap, states are looking for people who want to help children and can share their time and their homes. States also give foster parents many different forms of support, like training and financial assistance.'  Open adoption: The birth mother, and possibly the birth father, know something about the adoptive parents. They might even meet and exchange names or addresses. Closed adoption: The birth mother and adoptive parents do not meet each other or know each others' names."
Counseling and support groups for help ,"""If you've been having problems getting pregnant, you know how frustrating it can feel. Not being able to get pregnant can be one of the most stressful experiences a couple has. Both counseling and support groups can help you and your partner talk about your feelings and help you meet other couples struggling with the same issues. You will learn that anger, ""'grief'', blame, guilt, and ''depression'' are all normal. Couples do survive infertility, and can become closer and stronger in the process. Ask your doctor for the names of counselors or therapists with an interest in fertility.' "
What is tuberous sclerosis?,"'Tuberous sclerosis -- also called tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) -- is a rare, multi-system ''genetic disease'' that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, ''lungs'', and skin. It usually affects the central nervous system and results in a combination of symptoms including ''seizures'', developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, and ''kidney disease''.''The disorder affects as many as 25,000 to 40,000 individuals in the United States and about 1 to 2 million individuals worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of one in 6,000 newborns. TSC occurs in all races and ethnic groups, and in both genders.''The name tuberous sclerosis comes from the characteristic ''tuber'' or potato-like nodules in the brain, which calcify with age and become hard or sclerotic. The disorder -- once known as ''epiloia'' or '""Bourneville's disease ""'-- was first identified by a French physician more than 100 years ago.''Many TSC patients show evidence of the disorder in the first year of life. However, clinical features can be subtle initially, and many signs and symptoms take years to develop. As a result, TSC can be unrecognized or misdiagnosed for years.' "
Is TSC inherited?,"'Although some individuals inherit the disorder from a parent with TSC, most cases occur as sporadic cases due to new, spontaneous mutations in TSC1 or TSC2. In this situation, neither parent has the disorder or the faulty gene(s). Instead, a faulty gene first occurs in the affected individual.''In familial cases, TSC is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that the disorder can be transmitted directly from parent to child. In those cases, only one parent needs to have the faulty gene in order to pass it on to a child. If a parent has TSC, each offspring has a 50 percent chance of developing the disorder. Children who inherit TSC may not have the same symptoms as their parent and they may have either a milder or a more severe form of the disorder.''Rarely, individuals acquire TSC through a process called ''gonadal mosaicism'"". These patients have parents with no apparent defects in the two genes that cause the disorder. Yet these parents can have a child with TSC because a portion of one of the parent's reproductive cells (sperm or eggs) can contain the genetic mutation without the other cells of the body being involved. In cases of gonadal mosaicism, genetic testing of a blood sample might not reveal the potential for passing the disease to offspring."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of TSC?,"'TSC can affect many different systems of the body, causing a variety of signs and symptoms. Signs of the disorder vary depending on which system and which organs are involved. The natural course of TSC varies from individual to individual, with symptoms ranging from very mild to quite severe. In addition to the benign tumors that frequently occur in TSC, other common symptoms include ''seizures'', cognitive impairment, behavior problems, and skin abnormalities. Tumors can grow in nearly any organ, but they most commonly occur in the brain, kidneys, heart, lungs, and skin. ''Malignant'' tumors are rare in TSC. Those that do occur primarily affect the kidneys.''Brain involvement in TSC'' Three types of ''brain lesions'' are seen in TSC: ''cortical tubers'', for which the disease is named, generally form on the surface of the brain but may also appear in the deep areas of the brain: ''subependymal nodules'' (SEN), which form in the walls of the ventricles -- the fluid-filled cavities of the brain; and ''subependymal giant-call astrocytomas'' (SEGA), which develop from SEN and grow such that they may block the flow of fluid within the brain, causing a buildup of fluid and pressure and leading to ''headaches'' and ''blurred vision''.''TSC usually causes the greatest problems for those affected and their family members through effects on brain function. Most individuals with TSC will have seizures at some point during their life. Seizures of all types may occur, including ''infantile spasms''; tonic-clonic seizures (also known as ''grand mal'' seizures); or tonic, akinetic, atypical absence, myoclonic, complex partial or generalized squires. ''Infantile spasms'' can occur as soon as the day of birth and are often difficult to recognize. Seizures can also be difficult to control by medication, and sometimes surgery or other measures are used.''Abut one-half to two-thirds of individuals with TSC have developmental delays ranging from mild ''learning disabilities'' to severe impairment. Behavior problems, including aggression, sudden rage, ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'', acting out, ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'', and repetitive, destructive, or self-harming behavior occur in children with TSC and can be difficult to manage. About one-third of children with TSC meet criteria for ''autism spectrum disorder''.''Kidney problems'' such as ''cysts'' and ''angiomyolipomas'' occur in an estimated 70 to 80 percent of individuals with TSC, usually occurring between ages 15 and 30. Cysts are usually small, appear in limited numbers, and cause no serious problems. Approximately 2 percent of individuals with TSC develop large numbers of cysts in a pattern similar to ''polycystic kidney disease'' during childhood. In these cases, kidney function is compromised and ''kidney failure'' occurs. In rare instances, the cysts may bleed, leading to blood loss and ''anemia''.''Angiomyolipomas-benign growths consisting of fatty tissue and muscle cells-are the most common kidney lesions in TSC. These growths are seen in the majority of individuals with TSC, but are also found in about one of every 300 people without TSC. Angiomyolipomas caused by TSC are usually found in both kidneys and in most cases they produce no symptoms. However, they can sometimes grow so large that they cause ''pain'' or kidney failure. Bleeding from angiomyolipomas may also occur, causing both ''pain'' and ''weakness''. If severe bleeding does not stop naturally, there may severe blood loss, resulting in profound ''anemia'' and a life-threatening drop in ''blood pressure'', warranting urgent medical attention.''Other rare kidney problems include renal cell ''carcinoma'', developing from an angiomyolipoma, and oncocytomas, benign tumors unique to individuals with TSC.''Tumors called cardiac ''rhabdomyomas'' are often found in the hearts of infants and young children with TSC, and they are often seen on ''prenatal'' fetus ''ultrasound'' exams. If the tumors are large or there are multiple tumors, they can block circulation and cause death. However, if they do not cause problems at birth -- when in most cases they are at their largest size -- they usually become smaller with time and do not affect the individual in later life.''Benign tumors called ''phakomas'' are sometimes found in the eyes of individuals with TSC, appearing as white patches on the retina. Generally they do not cause ''vision loss'' or other vision problems, but they can be used to help diagnose the disease.''Additional tumors and cysts may be found in other areas of the body, including the ''liver'', lung, and pancreas. Bone cysts, ''rectal polyps'', gum fibromas, and dental pits may also occur.''A wide variety of skin abnormalities may occur in individuals with TSC. Most cause no problems but are helpful in diagnosis. Some cases may cause disfigurement, necessitating treatment. The most common skin abnormalities include:''Lung lesions are present in about one-third of adult women with TSC and are much less commonly seen in men. Lung lesions include lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and multinodular multifocal pneumocyte hyperplasia (MMPH). LAM is a ''tumor''-like disorder in which cells proliferate in the lungs, and there is lung destruction with ''cyst'' formation There is a range of symptoms with LAM, with many TSC individuals having no symptoms, while others suffer with breathlessness, which can progress and be severe. MMPH is a more benign ''tumor'' that occurs in men and women equally.'  Hypomelanic macules (""ash leaf spots""), which are white or lighter patches of skin that may appear anywhere on the body and are caused by a lack of skin pigment or melanin -- the substance that gives skin its color. Reddish spots or bumps called facial angiofibromas (also called adenoma sebaceum), which appear on the face (sometimes resembling acne) and consist of blood vessels and fibrous tissue. Raised, discolored areas on the forehead called forehead plaques, which are common and unique to TSC and may help doctors diagnose the disorder. Areas of thick leathery, pebbly skin called shagreen patches, usually found on the lower back or nape of the neck. Small fleshy tumors called ungual orsubungual fibromas that grow around and under the toenails or fingernails and may need to be surgically removed if they enlarge or cause bleeding. These usually appear later in life, ages 20-50. Other skin features that are not unique to individuals with TSC, including molluscum fibrosum or skin tags, which typically occur across the back of the neck and shoulders, café au lait spots or flat brown marks, and poliosis, a tuft or patch of white hair that may appear on the scalp or eyelids."
What causes tuberous sclerosis?,"'TSC is caused by defects, or mutations, on two genes -- TSC1 and TSC2. Only one of the genes needs to be affected for TSC to be present. The TSC1 gene, discovered in 1997, is on chromosome 9 and produces a protein called ''hamartin''. The TSC2 gene, discovered in 1993, is on chromosome 16 and produces the protein ''tuberin''. Scientists believe these proteins act in a complex as growth suppressors by inhibiting the activation of a master, evolutionarily conserved kinase called mTOR. Loss of regulation of mTOR occurs in cells lacking either hamartin or tuberin, and this leads to abnormal differentiation and development, and to the generation of enlarged cells, as are seen in TSC ''brain lesions''.' "
How is TSC diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of TSC is based upon clinical criteria. In many cases the first clue to recognizing TSC is the presence of seizures or delayed development. In other cases, the first sign may be white patches on the skin (hypomelanotic macules) or the identification of cardiac tumor rhabdomyoma.''Diagnosis of the disorder is based on a careful clinical exam in combination with computed tomography (CT) or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') of the brain, which may show tubers in the brain, and an ''ultrasound of the heart'', liver, and kidneys, which may show tumors in those organs. Doctors should carefully examine the skin for the wide variety of skin features, the fingernails and toenails for ungual fibromas, the ''teeth'"" and gums for dental pits and/or gum fibromas, and the eyes for retinal lesions. A Wood's lamp or ultraviolet light may be used to locate the hypomelantic macules which are sometimes hard to see on infants and individuals with pale or fair skin. Because of the wide variety of signs of TSC, it is best if a doctor experienced in the diagnosis of TSC evaluates a potential patient.""'In infants TSC may be suspected if the child has cardiac rhabdomyomas or seizures (infantile spasms) at birth. With a careful examination of the skin and brain, it may be possible to diagnose TSC in a very young infant. However, many children are not diagnosed until later in life when their seizures begin and other symptoms such as facial angiofibromas appear.' "
How is TSC treated?,"'There is no cure for TSC, although treatment is available for a number of the symptoms. Antiepileptic ''drugs'' may be used to control seizures. ''Vigabatrin'' is a particularly useful medication in TSC, and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of infantile spasms in TSC, although it has significant side effects. The FDA has approved the drug everolimus (Afinitor®) to treat subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA ''brain tumors'') and angiomyolipoma kidney tumors. Specific medications may be prescribed for behavior problems. Intervention programs including special schooling and occupational therapy may benefit individuals with special needs and developmental issues. Surgery may be needed in case of complications connected to tubers, SEN or SEGA, as well as in risk of hemorrhage from kidney tumors. Respiratory insufficiency due to LAM can be treated with supplemental oxygen therapy or lung transplantation if severe.''Because TSC is a lifelong condition, individuals need to be regularly monitored by a doctor to make sure they are receiving the best possible treatments. Due to the many varied symptoms of TSC, care by a clinician experienced with the disorder is recommended.''Basic laboratory studies have revealed insight into the function of the TSC genes and has led to recent use of rapamycin and related drugs for treating some manifestations of TSC. Rapamycin has been shown to be effective in treating SEGA, the ''brain tumor'' seen in TSC. However, its benefit for a variety of other aspects of and tumors seen in people with TSC is less certain, and ''clinical trials'' looking at the benefit carefully are continuing. Rapamycin and related drugs are not yet approved by the FDA for any purpose in individuals with TSC.' "
What is the prognosis?,"'The prognosis for individuals with TSC is highly variable and depends on the severity of symptoms. Those individuals with mild symptoms usually do well and have a normal life expectancy, while paying attention to TSC-specific issues. Individuals who are severely affected can suffer from severe mental retardation and persistent ''epilepsy''.''All individuals with TSC are at risk for life-threatening conditions related to the ''brain tumors'', kidney lesions, or LAM. Continued monitoring by a physician experienced with TSC is important. With appropriate medical care, most individuals with the disorder can look forward to normal life expectancy.' "
What research is being done?,"'Within the Federal Government, the leading supporter of research on TSC is the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). The NINDS, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is responsible for supporting and conducting research on the brain and the central nervous system. NINDS conducts research in its laboratories at NIH and also supports studies through grants to major medical institutions across the country. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Cancer Institute, also components of the NIH, support and conduct research on TSC.''Scientists who study TSC seek to increase our understanding of the disorder by learning more about the TSC1 and TSC2 genes that can cause the disorder and the function of the proteins-tuberin and hamartin-produced by these genes. Scientists hope knowledge gained from their current research will improve the genetic test for TSC and lead to new avenues of treatment, methods of prevention, and, ultimately, a cure for this disorder.'""Research studies run the gamut from very basic scientific investigation to clinical translational research. For example, some investigators are trying to identify all the protein components that are in the same 'signaling pathway' in which the TSC1 and TSC2 protein products and the mTOR protein are involved. Other studies are focused on understanding in detail how the disease develops, both in animal models and in patients, to better define new ways of controlling or preventing the development of the disease. Finally, ""'clinical trials'' of rapamycin are underway (with NINDS and NCI support) to rigorously test the potential benefit of this compound for some of the tumors that are problematic in TSC patients.'

What is toxic shock syndrome?,"'Toxic shock syndrome is a severe illness associated with group A ''Streptococcus'' (''GAS'' or ''Streptococcus pyogenes''); this bacterium produces a toxin termed TSS toxin-1 (TSST-, or phage-group-1 streptococcal toxic shock syndrome). TSS was first described in 1978 in children, but subsequent reports identified TSS outbreaks in women who use tampons. Although first thought to be additionally associated with ''menstruation'', over the past years, less than half of TTS cases have been ''menstruation''-related. Although most cases of TTS occur in women who menstruate, about 25% of infections occur in men. TSS is also associated with ''Staphylococcus'' infections; some ''strains'' of these bacteria produce exotoxins very similar to TSST-1.'  "
How do you get toxic shock syndrome?,"'The cause of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is one of several closely related exotoxins secreted by bacteria that are infecting the person. The toxins (also termed superantigens) activate T cells of the immune system to produce chemicals known as cytokines that subsequently cause shock and tissue damage.''The superantigens have a unique way of interacting with the immune system. Although there are several closely related exotoxins, about 80% of individuals with TSS have an illness caused by TSST-1 or a similar exotoxin. Other exotoxins such as those produced by enterococci A, C, D, E, and H cause most of the remaining 20% of infections.''M protein, a filamentous protein on the cell membrane of group A ''Streptococcus'' bacteria enhances the likelihood of the bacterial strain being more likely to cause disease. Bacterial strains that lack M protein are less lethal because M protein can protect bacteria from host immune defenses. In addition, M protein apparently enhances cell damage and inflammation caused by exotoxins.' "
What are risk factors for toxic shock syndrome?,"'Risk factors for TSS include a history of using high-absorbency tampons, surgical wounds, history of using a ''diaphragm'' or ''contraceptive sponge'', having a localized ''deep skin infection'', abortion, ''burns'', and immunosuppression (for example, as seen with ''diabetes'', chronic lung or ''heart disease'', or in elderly patients).''Not recognizing TTS symptoms while using a tampon can be a serious mistake. For example, Sara Manitoski, a 16-year-old who was on an overnight school trip, complained of ''stomach cramps'' before she went to bed. The following morning, she was found unresponsive. She ultimately died, and the ''autopsy'' revealed that she died from TTS.' "
What are toxic shock syndrome symptoms and signs?,"'TSS symptoms and signs a resemble those found in other infections; however, the most common symptoms of TSS are as follows:''Skin shedding may occur on the palms and soles of the ''feet'' about one or two weeks after the initial infection begins.''Some doctors classify TSS cases by stages -- others do not. However, early symptoms such as a high fever and a falling ''blood pressure'' (shock-like symptoms) may occur before later stages of organ damage appear. Early symptoms are ''flu-like'' and can be confused with those of other diseases, like ''norovirus'' or other viral and bacterial infections, especially in young women.'  Fever higher than 38.9 C (102 F) Low blood pressure (about <90 systolic); lightheadedness Decreased kidney function Disturbances in blood clotting (platelets less than or equal to 100,000/mm3) Liver involvement (twice the upper limit of normal for liver enzyme measurements) Acute respiratory distress Vomiting A sunburn-like red rash that's flat and/or shedding of the skin (erythroderma) Damage and death of soft tissues, such as necrotizing fasciitis, myositis, or gangrene due to flesh-eating bacterial infections Fatigue Headache Muscle aches"
How is toxic shock syndrome diagnosed?,"'In general, after the history and physical, if the patient has ''low blood pressure'' and multiorgan involvement characterized by two of the above listed symptoms of organ dysfunction (renal, lung, liver, skin, or blood), the clinical diagnosis of TSS is made, according to CDC criteria. A confirmation of the diagnosis is done by isolation of one of the causative bacteria; the bacteria should be identified as capable of producing exotoxin that either is, or functions like, TSST-1.' "
What is the treatment for toxic shock syndrome?,"'The treatment for TSS varies from patient to patient; however, the following treatments are fairly common. Patients with TSS usually will be treated with two or more of the following treatments:' Intravenous fluids to treat shock IV antibiotics Deep surgical cleaning of any infected wounds Cardiac medications to help treat low blood pressure Oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation as needed Blood products if needed Dialysis for patients with kidney failure Hospitalization in an intensive-care unit"
What is the prognosis of toxic shock syndrome?,"'Patients with TSS who are diagnosed early and given appropriate treatment often have a good prognosis. Early treatment can help prevent life-threatening complications such as ''renal failure'', respiratory failure, and coagulation disorders. However, the mortality (death) rate is about 5%-15%, and patients who develop complications have a poorer prognosis than those who do not. Patients who develop TSS are at risk for reinfection.' "
How can I prevent toxic shock syndrome?,"'It is possible to reduce the chances of developing TSS. Menstruating females should minimize use of items like tampons, diaphragms, and sponges. Women should change tampons frequently and avoid super-absorbent tampons. For example, polyester, carboxymethylcellulose, and polyacrylate rayon, which increase tampon absorbency, have been removed from tampons because they were associated with increased TSS toxin production. Anyone diagnosed with TSS has a higher risk of reinfection. Women diagnosed with TSS should avoid tampon use in the future. Your ob-gyn doctor may provide additional recommendations. Early treatment of wounds, especially deep wounds, can help prevent TSS.' "
Introduction to birth control,"'\tThe terminology used to describe ''birth control methods'' include: ''contraception'', ''pregnancy'' ''prevention'', ''fertility'' control, and ''family planning''. But no matter what the terminology, sexually active people can choose from an abundance of methods to reduce the possibility of their ''becoming pregnant''. Nevertheless, no method of ''birth control'' available\xa0today offers perfect protection against sexually transmitted infections (''sexually transmitted diseases'', or ''STDs''), except abstinence.''\tIn simple terms, all methods of ''birth control'"" are based on either preventing a man's sperm from reaching and entering a woman's egg (""'fertilization'"") or preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the woman's uterus (her womb) and starting to grow. New methods of birth control are being developed and tested all the time. And what is appropriate for a couple at one point may change with time and circumstances.""'\tUnfortunately, no birth control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.' "
Permanent methods of contraception (surgical sterilization),"'\tSterilization is considered a permanent method of contraception. In certain cases, sterilization can be reversed, but the success of this procedure is not guaranteed. For this reason, sterilization is meant for men and women who do not intend to have children in the future.' "
Vasectomy,"'\tA ''vasectomy'' is a form of sterilization of a man. A vasectomy ensures that no sperm will exit from his penis when he ejaculates during sexual intercourse.''\tA vasectomy is usually performed by either a ''urologist'' or a general surgeon. Under local anesthesia, the vas deferens (tubes that carry sperm from the testicles into the urethra, also known as ductus deferens) from each testicle is severed. The open ends are then closed off. A vasectomy can be performed in the clinic and involves making two small openings in the scrotum. After a vasectomy, the man may feel tenderness or ''bruising'' around the incision site.''\tA vasectomy does not interfere with the ability of a man to have an erection or the quantity of his ejaculation fluid. After a man has a vasectomy, another second form of birth control should be used until his ejaculate fluid is found to be free from sperm. This usually takes 10 to 20 ejaculations.''\tVasectomy reversals are possible, but they tend to be expensive and are not guaranteed to be effective. A vasectomy should be considered a permanent form of birth control.''\tA vasectomy does not protect a man or his partner from sexually transmitted infections.' "
Tubal ligation (tubes tied),"'Tubal ligation is also known as ""having one\'s tubes tied,"" or having a ""tubal."" Tubal ligation is for women, and like a vasectomy, should be considered a permanent form of birth control.'""A tubal ligation is performed under general, regional, or local anesthesia and can be performed as an outpatient procedure. The surgeon or OB/GYN\xa0uses one of several procedures in order to access a woman's Fallopian tubes (which run from the top part of her uterus to each ovary). A ""'laparoscopy'' is a procedure in which a small incision is made\xa0just below the navel. A viewing tube (scope) can then be inserted through this incision to view and reach the Fallopian tubes. A minilaparotomy is a small incision in the lower abdomen is sometimes used for tubal ligation as an alternative to a laparoscopic procedure.'""Once the doctor has access to a woman's Fallopian tubes, they are closed off by using a clip, tying and cutting, or cauterizing (burning) the tubes. The procedure takes anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes.""'Side effects of a tubal ligation may include infection, bleeding (hemorrhage), and any effects or complications associated with being under general anesthesia.'""A tubal ligation blocks a woman's Fallopian tubes. As a result of the procedure, about 1 inch of each tube is blocked off. An egg can no longer travel down the tube to the uterus, and sperm cannot make contact with the egg. Tubal ligation should have no effect on a woman's ""'menstrual cycle'' or hormone production.'""A woman's tubal ligation can be surgically reversed, usually with more success than in men who have had a vasectomy. About 14% of women in the US seek information about a reversal of tubal ligation.""'A tubal ligation does not protect a woman or her partner from sexually transmitted infections (sexually transmitted diseases, or ''STDs''). It is also not an absolute method of birth control because a small percentage of women become ''pregnant'' after a tubal ligation. Pregnancy after tubal ligation is uncommon (occurring in less than 2% of women), and the risk of pregnancy appears to be related to age (younger women have more post-tubal ligation ''pregnancies'') as well as the type of procedure used for the sterilization.' "
Hysteroscopic sterilization,"""\tHysteroscopic sterilization is a nonsurgical form of permanent birth control in which a physician inserts a 4-centimeter (1.6 inch) long metal coil into each one of a woman's two Fallopian tubes via a scope passed through the cervix into the uterus (hysteroscope), and from there into the openings of the Fallopian tubes. Over the next few months, tissue grows over the coil to form a plug that prevents fertilized eggs from traveling from the ovaries to the uterus.""""\tThe procedure takes about 30 minutes, can be done in a doctor's office, and usually requires only a local anesthetic. During a 3-month period after the coils are inserted, women must use other forms of birth control until their physician verifies by an imaging test known as a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) that the Fallopian tubes are completely blocked.""'\tLike tubal ligation, this form of sterilization is permanent (not reversible) and is designed as an alternative to surgical sterilization which requires general anesthesia and an incision. About 6% of women who have the procedure develop side effects, mainly due to improper placement of the coils.''\tThis form of sterilization, like other methods of surgical sterilization, does not protect a woman or her partner from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).' "
Hysterectomy,"'A ''hysterectomy'"" is the surgical removal of a woman's uterus and, depending on her overall health status and the reason for the operation, perhaps her ovaries as well. For practical purposes, no woman who has had a hysterectomy can become pregnant; it is an irreversible method of birth control and absolute sterilization. A laparoscopic hysterectomy (removal of the uterus through tiny incisions in the abdomen through which instruments are placed) is possible when there are no complications and no suspicion of ""'cancer''. A supra-cervical hysterectomy, which spares the cervix and removes the upper part of the uterus, is also a common surgical technique.''If a woman has other chronic medical problems that may be helped by a hysterectomy (such as abnormally excessive menstrual bleeding, ''uterine fibroids'', ''uterine growths''), than this may be an appropriate procedure for her to consider. Otherwise, contraception should be considered a secondary benefit and not a sole reason to have the procedure.' "
What is tube thoracostomy?,"'Tube thoracostomy, also known as open chest drainage, is a surgical procedure to drain the collection of pleural fluid, air, blood, or pus from the pleural ''cavity'' through a tube inserted in your chest.''The pleural ''cavity'' is the space lying between the pleura (visceral and parietal), the two thin layers that surround the ''lungs''. This space contains a small amount of liquid known as pleural fluid, which acts as a lubricant for the expansion and contraction of the lungs during ''respiration''. When there is an excessive collection of pleural fluid or build-up of air, blood, or pus in the pleural cavity, you will start having trouble ''breathing''. In such conditions, tube thoracostomy eases breathing.' "
Why is a tube thoracostomy performed?,"'In some situations, such as severe traumatic injuries to the chest, tube thoracostomy becomes an emergency and a life-saving procedure. It is also performed as a pre-planned procedure in certain diseases that cause buildup of fluid or air in the pleural cavity.''Tube thoracostomy is performed if the patient develops:' Pleural effusion: Excessive collection of pleural fluid in the pleural cavity Pneumothorax: Leakage of air in the pleural activity Hemothorax: Collection of blood in the pleural cavity Hemopneumothorax: Collection of blood as well as air in the pleural cavity Hydrothorax: Collection of fluid in the pleural cavity due to organ (liver or heart)  failure Chylothorax: Collection of lymphatic fluid (chyle) in the pleural cavity Empyema:  Collection of pus in the pleural cavity."
What are the guidelines for tube thoracostomy management?,"'Surgeons follow a certain set of rules (guidelines) for any surgical procedure. The guidelines for tube thoracostomy include:' The patient is screened for clotting or bleeding disorder with certain blood tests. If one of the patient’s lungs has been removed (pneumonectomy), the surgeon will consult a cardiothoracic surgeon to drain the post-pneumonectomy space.  If the chest drain insertion is a pre-planned procedure, the blood-thinning medication, warfarin will be discontinued for a few days before the procedure. Prior to commencing chest tube insertion, the surgeon will explain the procedure to the patient and obtain aformal, written consent from the patient or their family. The patient will be given a sedative medicine (benzodiazepine or opioid) to make them relaxed throughout the procedure. The patient will lie on their back or sit and lean forwards. The skin below the armpit will be marked with a pen. The surgeon will check if they can draw free air or fluid from the marked area.  A chest X-ray or an ultrasonography (USG) will be used to select the appropriate site for chest tube placement. The marked area will be cleaned with a sterile solution before inserting the chest tube. Antibiotics will be started if the patient has accidental injuries. An anesthetic will be injected into the marked site prior to insertion of the chest tube, Chest tube insertion will be performed without substantial force. The chest tube may have valves at its insertion, and it is connected directly to the outside collection chamber, which collects drainage from the chest cavity. "
What are the strategies for tube thoracostomy management?,"'In patients with empyema or ''pleural effusion'', initial removal of 50-200 mL of fluid using a syringe attached to a needle may be done prior to the insertion of the chest tube.''The incision will be made over the rib to minimize the risks of injury to the nerve and blood vessels that follow the lower margin of each rib.''Small-bore drains are recommended, as they are more comfortable than larger-bore tubes. Large-bore drains are recommended for drainage of acute hemothorax and to check for further blood loss.\xa0' The strategies for managing the complications of tube thoracostomy are as follows: If the chest tube has been placed too far into the chest, it will be retracted If the chest tube goes into the abdominal space, it will be removed. If bleeding occurs at the incision site, it will be stopped by pressing on it tightly. If bleeding occurs in the chest and does not resolve spontaneously, the chest might be opened (thoracotomy). Bleeding in the abdomen which is as result of liver or spleen injury requires emergency opening of the abdomen (laparotomy) Persistent pneumothorax or hemothorax might require insertion of a new chest tube. If the patient starts coughing or experiences chest tightness, the surgeon will end the procedure.  Most experts recommend removal of no more than 1-1.5 L of fluid at any one time. "
What is tuberculosis (TB)?,"'Tuberculosis'' (''TB'') is a disease (bacterial infection) caused by a bacterium named ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' that usually infects the ''lungs'', but in some individuals, the bacteria can attack any part of the body. Before treatments were effective against TB, it was the leading cause of death in the United States.' "
Is tuberculosis (TB) contagious?,"'Yes, TB is highly ''contagious'' and can be transmitted from an infected person to an uninfected person, mainly when a person with TB ''coughs'', sneezes, speaks, or even sings (known as airborne transmission or airborne disease). Other people who breathe in the aerosolized bacteria can become infected. Some individuals have TB infections but show no symptoms because their bodies prevent TB organisms from growing. Patients with this type of infection are termed as having latent (dormant) TB. Individuals with latent TB have the organisms suppressed; in this condition, the individuals are not contagious for TB when the organisms are dormant. However, if a person with latent TB is no longer able to suppress the TB organisms, that individual can then become contagious.''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'"" organisms can survive for a while even in the deceased; to avoid getting TB, physicians who perform autopsies have to be careful not to spread the organisms into the air while they're doing their investigations."" "
How will I know if I have tuberculosis?,"'People may suspect they have tuberculosis if they have spent any length of time around ''coughing'' or ''sneezing'' individuals known to have tuberculosis. Symptoms and signs of TB include the following:''A physician can order skin tests, TB blood tests, and send sputum samples for specialized stains and culture to definitively diagnose tuberculosis in an individual.' Severe coughing lasting at least three weeks or more Night sweats Coughing up blood or sputum Chest pains Fatigue Weight loss with no appetite Fever and chills"
How do people transmit tuberculosis?,"'TB spreads when the organisms are coughed up or aerosolized by sneezing, speaking, or singing. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that TB is not spread by handshakes, sharing food, ''drinks'', or toothbrushes, touching items like toilet seats, clothing, or bedsheets, or kissing. People with other health problems like ''diabetes'', ''HIV'' infection, ''drug abuse'', ''alcohol abuse'', and/or recent exposure to individuals with TB are at increased risk for contracting TB.' "
What is the incubation period for tuberculosis?,"'The incubation period for tuberculosis is measured from exposure time to time of development of a positive tuberculin skin test. In most individuals, the incubation period varies from approximately two to 12 weeks. However, the risk for developing active disease is highest in the first two years after infection and development of a positive TB skin test.' "
How will I know if I am cured of tuberculosis? What is the contagious period for TB?,"'Treatment for tuberculosis, both active infections and latent TB infections, involves the use of several different anti-TB medications (for example, ''isoniazid'' [Nydrazid, Laniazid, INH], rifampin [''Rifadin''], ''rifapentine'' [''Priftin''], ''ethambutol'' [''Myambutol''], ''pyrazinamide''), often in combination, for up to a total of six to nine months. A physician will determine the best treatment for you on an individual basis, since some strains of the bacteria are resistant to certain ''drugs''. Some people are probably noncontagious after two weeks while on medication or during treatment but some researchers suggest that others may take longer (months) until they are not able to spread the disease. Reduction or absence of symptoms and signs suggests that a person on antibiotics is unlikely to be contagious, but this is not always true.' "
When should I contact a medical caregiver about tuberculosis?,"'Tuberculosis, like many diseases, is best treated early in the infection. Consequently, you should contact a physician if'""An individual should not put off seeing a physician if there's slightest chance he or she has TB because the disease can progress and eventually cause death if not treated in a timely fashion.""  you have been exposed to someone with active TB; you have had a positive TB skin test; you have developed symptoms of a severe cough with blood-tinged or bloody sputum; you have other symptoms of TB, such as fatigue, fever, or night sweats along with coughing; your condition worsens with treatment; you have symptoms of yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) while undergoing treatment; your vision changes, such as developing blurry or odd colored vision."
What is tuberculosis?,"'Tuberculosis (TB) is a multisystemic infectious disease caused by ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' (or TB, TB germs), a rod-shaped bacterium. TB (TB may stand for the disease or the bacteria that cause the disease) is the most common cause of infectious disease-related mortality worldwide (about 10 million people worldwide were sick with TB in 2017, and about 1.3 million people died from TB worldwide in 2017 according to the World Health Organization [WHO] and the CDC). ''HIV''-associated TB infections are a leading cause of death in ''HIV'' patients. ''TB symptoms'' can span such a wide range that TB is termed the ""great imitator"" by many who study infectious diseases because TB symptoms can mimic many other diseases. Additional terms describe TB. The terms include consumption, Pott\'s disease, active, latent, pulmonary, cutaneous, and others (see the following section), and they appear in both medical and nonmedical publications. In most instances, the different terms refer to a specific type of TB with some unique symptoms or findings. The most common site (about 85%) for TB to develop is in the pulmonary tract although it may infect other parts of the body. Humans are the only known hosts for ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' (although it can infect animals). The bacteria may stain weakly both gram-negative and gram-positive due to its cell surface so medical professionals use acid-fast stains to visualize the cells with a microscope.'""TB has likely been infecting humans for many centuries; evidence of TB infections has been found in cadavers that date back to about 8000 BC. The Greeks termed it as a wasting away disease (phthisis). For many European countries, TB caused death in about 25% of adults and was the leading cause of death in the U.S. until the early 1900s. Robert Koch discovered TB's cause, ""'Mycobacterium tuberculosis'"", in 1882. With increased understanding of TB, public health initiatives, treatment methods like isolation of patients (quarantine), and the development of drugs to treat TB, the incidence of the disease, especially in developed countries, has been markedly reduced. However, the CDC estimates one-third of the world's population is infected with TB with about 1.8 million deaths per year. About 60% of all TB-infected people are located in India, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Pakistan, and South Africa.""""There is a vast amount of detailed information available in the medical literature on all aspects of this potentially debilitating and lethal disease. The goal of this article is to introduce the reader to TB and help them to obtain a general knowledge about TB's cause, transmission, diagnostic tests, treatments, and prevention methods against tuberculosis infection."" "
Are there different types of tuberculosis (TB)?,"'There are many types of tuberculosis, but the main two types are termed either active or latent tuberculosis infection. Active TB is when the disease is actively producing symptoms and can be transmitted to other people; latent disease is when the person is infected with ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'"" bacteria, but the bacteria are not producing symptoms (usually due to the body's immune system suppressing the bacterial growth and spread) and have no TB bacteria in the sputum. People with latent TB usually cannot transfer ""'Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' bacteria to others unless the immune system fails; the failure causes reactivation (bacterial growth is no longer suppressed) that results in active TB so the person becomes contagious. Latent TB resembles ''chickenpox'' infection that goes dormant and may reactivate years later.''Many other types of TB exist in either the active or latent form. These types are named for the signs and for the body systems ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' preferentially infect, and these infection types vary from person to person. Consequently, pulmonary tuberculosis mainly infects the pulmonary system (''lungs''), cutaneous TB has skin symptoms, while miliary TB describes widespread small infected sites (lesions or granulomas about 1 mm-5 mm) found throughout body organs. It is not uncommon for some people to develop more than one type of active TB. More types will be listed in the symptoms and signs section below.''Atypical mycobacteria that may cause disease are the ''M. avium'' complex, ''M. fortuitum'' complex, and ''M. kansasii''.' "
What causes tuberculosis?,"'The cause of TB is infection of human tissue(s) by the bacterium ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'"" (mycobacteria or TB). These bacteria are slow growing, aerobic, and can grow within body cells (an intracellular parasitic bacterium). Its unique cell wall helps protect it from the body's defenses and gives mycobacteria the ability to retain certain dyes like fuchsin (a reddish dye) after an acid rinse that rarely happens with other bacterial, fungal, or parasitic genera.""'Mycobacteria that escape destruction by body defenses may be spread by blood or lymphatic pathways to most organs, with preference to those that oxygenate well (lungs, kidneys, and bones, for example). Typical TB lesions, termed granulomas, usually consist of a central necrotic area, then a zone with macrophages, giant Langerhans cells and lymphocytes that become surrounded by immature macrophages, plasma cells, and more lymphocytes. These granulomas also contain mycobacteria. In latent infections, a fibrous capsule usually surrounds the granulomas, and in some people, the granulomas calcify, but if the immune defenses fail initially or at a later time (reactivate), the bacteria continue to spread and disrupt organ functions.'  "
What are risk factors for tuberculosis?,"'Although TB is not easily spread, it is usually spread between people who are in close contact (working together or living together).''There are many risk factors for developing tuberculosis. Certain groups of people have a high risk, such as people who work in hospitals and other areas where TB-infected people may reside (jails, ''nursing'' homes, group homes for ''HIV'' patients, homeless shelters). Close association with drug users, or people with known TB infections are also at higher risk. Other people at high risk include the following:' Visitors and immigrants from areas known to have high incidence of TB Children and the elderly with weakened immune systems (especially those with a positive TB skin test, see below) Patients with HIV infection Drug abusers, especially IV drug abuse Head and neck cancer patients Transplant patients Diabetics Kidney disease patients People undergoing immunosuppressive therapy Silicosis"
What are tuberculosis symptoms and signs?,"'Although there are a number of TB types, pulmonary tuberculosis is responsible for the majority (about 85%) of TB infections. Consequently, pulmonary TB symptoms and signs may occur with or even before other types of TB are diagnosed. The classical clinical symptoms and signs of pulmonary TB may include the following:''Other types are loosely classified as extra pulmonary and often have symptoms that are nonspecific but frequently localized to the involved site. The following includes the signs and symptoms of additional types of TB:'   Fever Night sweats Cough (often chronic) Hemoptysis (coughing up bloody sputum) Decrease or loss of appetite Weight loss and/or muscle loss (unintentional) Fatigue and/or malaise Chest pain (pain while breathing) Shortness of breath Swollen lymph nodes Pneumonitis (may be the only symptom in the elderly). Skeletal TB (also termed Pott's disease): spinal pain, back stiffness, paralysis is possible TB meningitis: headaches (variable in length but persistent), mental changes, coma TB arthritis: usually pain in a single joint (hips and knees most common) Genitourinary TB: dysuria, flank pain, increased frequency, masses or lumps (granulomas) Gastrointestinal TB: difficulty swallowing, nonhealing ulcers, abdominal pain, malabsorption, diarrhea (may be bloody) Miliary TB: many small nodules widespread in organs that resemble millet seeds (hence its name) Pleural TB: empyema and pleural effusions Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB): patients infected with TB bacteria that are resistant to multiple drugs XDR TB: patients infected with TB bacteria that are resistant to some of the most effective anti-TB medications; XDR stands for extensively drug resistant Caseous TB: Necrotic (dead and dying) tissue that is infected with TB organisms has a soft, dry, and cheesy appearance. End-stage TB: Patients may suffer fever, constant coughing, shortness of breath, weight loss, mental changes, and blood in their sputum before death."
"Is TB contagious, and how long is the incubation period and contagious period?","'TB is contagious and can be spread to others by airborne droplets during ''sneezing'', coughing, and contact with sputum, so you can get the disease by close contact with infected people; outbreaks occur in crowded conditions. The incubation period may vary from about two to 12 weeks. A person may remain contagious for a long time (as long as viable TB bacteria are present in sputum) and can remain contagious until they have been on appropriate therapy for several weeks. However, some people may be infected but suppress the infection and develop symptoms years later; some never develop symptoms or become contagious.' "
How do physicians diagnose tuberculosis? What is involved with TB testing?,"""Because TB may occur as either a latent or active form, the definitive diagnosis of active tuberculosis depends on the culture of mycobacteria from sputum or tissue biopsy. However, it may take weeks for these slow-growing bacteria to grow on specialized media. Since patients with latent TB do not require isolation or immediate drug therapy, it is useful to determine if a person is either not infected, has a latent infection, or is actively infected with transmissible TB bacteria. Consequently, doctors needed a presumptive test(s) that could reasonably assure that the person was infected or not so therapy could begin. After getting a patient's history and physical exam data, the next usual test is the skin test (termed the Mantoux tuberculin skin test or the tuberculin skin test or TST, sometimes referred to as a PPD test). The test involves injecting tuberculin (an extract made from killed mycobacteria) into the skin. In about 48-72 hours, the skin is examined for induration (swelling) by a qualified person; a positive test (induration) strongly suggests the patient has either been exposed to live mycobacteria or is actively infected (or had been vaccinated); no induration suggests the person tests negative for TB. This test can have false-positive results (especially in individuals vaccinated for TB with the BCG vaccine). False negative results can be caused by patients who are immunocompromised.""'Another test, IGRA (''interferon''-gamma release assays) can measure the immune response to ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''. Other quick tests are useful; chest X-rays can give evidence of lung infection while a sputum smear stained with certain dyes that are retained mainly (but not exclusively) by mycobacteria can show the presence of the bacterium. These tests, when examined by a doctor, are useful in establishing a presumptive diagnosis of either latent or active TB, and most doctors will initiate treatment based on their judgment of these tests. In addition, some of these tests are useful in the U.S. and elsewhere only in people who are not vaccinated with a TB vaccine (see below) but are less useful in vaccinated people. For some patients, culture studies still should be completed to determine the drug susceptibility of an infecting TB strain.''Other tests have been developed. For example, a ''PCR'' test (''polymerase chain reaction'"") to detect TB antigens and the LED-FM microscopic technique to identify TB organisms with microscopy may be used. Two other TB blood tests (also called interferon-gamma release assays or IGRAs) have been approved by the FDA and measure how strongly the body's immune system reacts to TB bacteria. IGRAs are recommended in testing patients who have been vaccinated against TB (see prevention section below).""'People with positive symptoms, positive blood tests, sputum smear, or culture positive are considered infected with TB and contagious (active TB).''Physicians diagnose and treat people with latent TB infections (LTBI) according to the following current CDC criteria:' 

Read Doctor's View
   No symptoms or physical findings suggestive of TB disease TST or IGRA result is usually positive Chest radiograph is typically normal If done, respiratory specimens are smear and culture negative Cannot spread TB bacteria to others Should consider treatment for LTBI to prevent TB disease (strongly advised by the CDC)"
What is the treatment for tuberculosis?,"'The treatment for TB depends on the type of TB infection and drug sensitivity of the mycobacteria. For latent TB, three anti-TB drugs are used in four different recommended schedules. The drugs are ''isoniazid'' (INH), rifampin (RIF; ''Rifadin''), and ''rifapentine'' (RPT; ''Priftin'"") and the CDC's four recommended schedules are below and are chosen by the treating doctor based on the patients overall health and type of TB the patient was likely exposed to.""'First-line drugs used to treat active TB are INH, RIF, ''ethambutol'' (EMB; ''Myambutol''), and ''pyrazinamide''. The CDC offers a guide for the basic treatment schedules for active TB (drug-susceptible TB organisms) as follows:'""The most current treatment guidelines need to be reviewed and correlated to the patient's specific condition and circumstances before any treatment is started.""'Treatment of drug-resistant (or antibiotic-resistant) and multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis TB can be difficult. These TB patients may require second-line drugs. Patients with these infections are recommended by the CDC to involve infectious-disease specialists as there are multiple approaches that involve other anti-TB drugs and variable treatment schedules that can be used. In addition, there are new drugs and treatment schedules being developed and approved by the FDA. The infectious-disease consultant may be aware of these newest treatments that may benefit specific patients. For example, bedaquiline (Sirturo) has been approved for treatment of MDR TB, and research with an antimicrobial drug, ''moxifloxacin'', suggests it may help in treatment protocols.''Some side effects of treatment may include the following:''Patients are urged to see their doctor if any side effects occur.''In some patients, the lung destruction may be severe and the only treatment left may be surgical resection of the diseased lung tissue.''Medications are needed for TB treatment. Home remedies will not treat TB but at best may help reduce symptoms. Home remedies may include milk, pineapple, Indian gooseberry, bananas, and many others. Patients should discuss these remedies with their doctors before use.'   Loss of appetite Nausea and/or vomiting Jaundice Paresthesia Bruise formation, bleeding Vision changes"
What types of doctors treat TB?,"""Although the patient's primary care doctor can oversee and coordinate treatment, other specialists like infectious disease, pulmonary medicine, internal medicine, critical care, and public health physicians can also be involved in the treatment."" "
What are complications of tuberculosis?,"'Although some people may develop no complications, others range from mild to severe complications, including death. Some of the more severe complications include lung function damage, bone pain (spine, ribs, and joints), meningitis, kidney and/or liver malfunction, cardiac tamponade, and visual disturbances.' "
What is the prognosis of tuberculosis?,"'For most people who live in areas where diagnosis and treatment is available, the prognosis of TB is good if they complete the treatment protocols. The recurrence rate of TB is low (0%-14%) and some may be due to reinfection. Drug-resistant tuberculosis is more difficult to treat, and the prognosis is not as good. The same poor prognosis occurs for those patients who are immunocompromised (for example, HIV-positive individuals), elderly, and in patients with previous infection and treatment for TB.' "
How can people prevent tuberculosis?,"'A vaccine against TB is commercially available; it is termed BCG, or Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine. However, the vaccine is not recommended for use in the U.S. because of the low risk for TB infections. Also, the vaccine is highly variable in its ability to prevent adult pulmonary disease. Another problem is that the vaccine may interfere with the interpretation of the tuberculin skin test. Despite this, a number of countries still use it to reduce childhood infections and miliary disease. Consequently, the CDC makes this recommendation: ""The BCG vaccine should be considered only for very select persons who meet specific criteria and in consultation with a TB expert.""''Currently, people who have active TB are suggested to be treated using isolation techniques along with anti-TB drugs to prevent spread according to the CDC. The CDC suggests that patients with probable active TB be isolated in a private room with negative pressure (air exhausted to outside or through a high-efficiency particulate air filter). Further, staff taking care of them must wear high-efficiency disposable masks sufficient to filter out any airborne mycobacteria. Continued isolation is suggested until sputum smears are negative for three consecutive determinations (usually after approximately two to four weeks of treatment). Sanatoriums (also spelled sanitorium or sanitarium) are where people with long-term illness, especially those with TB, used to be treated before good antibiotic therapy was available.''Researchers are attempting to produce an effective vaccine; there is a new study involving biobeads that contain several TB bacterial antigens and no live bacteria. The biobeads are being studied and may provide the first new vaccine against TB in 100 years.' "
"What is 
XDR TB?","'Extensively drug-resistant ''tuberculosis'' (XDR ''TB'') is a relatively rare type of multidrug-resistant ''tuberculosis'' (MDR ''TB''). It is resistant to almost all ''drugs'' used to treat TB, including the two best first-line drugs: ''isoniazid'' and rifampin. XDR TB is also resistant to the best second-line medications: fluoroquinolones and at least one of three injectable drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). ' "
How is XDR TB spread?,"'Drug-susceptible (regular) TB and XDR TB are spread the same way. TB germs are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the ''lungs'' or throat ''coughs'', sneezes, speaks, or sings. These germs can float in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. Persons who breathe in the air containing these TB germs can become infected. ''TB is not spread by' shaking someone's hand sharing food or drink touching bed linens or toilet 
seats sharing toothbrushes kissing smoking or sharing cigarettes"
"Why is XDR TB 
so serious?","'Because XDR TB is resistant to the most powerful first-line and second-line drugs, patients are left with treatment options that are much less effective and often have worse treatment outcomes. XDR TB is of special concern for persons with ''HIV'' infection or other conditions that can weaken the immune system. These persons are more likely to develop TB disease once they are infected, and also have a higher risk of death once they develop TB disease. ' "
Who is at risk for getting XDR TB?,"'Drug-resistant TB (MDR or XDR) is more common in people who: '   Do not take their TB medicine regularly Do not take all of their TB medicines 
as told by their doctor or nurse Develop active TB disease again, after having 
taken TB medicine in the past Come from areas of the world where drug-resistant 
TB is common Have spent time with someone known to have drug-resistant TB 
disease"
How can I prevent myself from getting TB?,"'Avoid close contact or prolonged time with known TB patients in crowded, enclosed environments like clinics, hospitals, prisons, or homeless shelters. ' "
Can the TB vaccine (BCG) help prevent XDR TB?,"'There is a ''vaccine'' for TB disease called Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). It is used in some countries to prevent severe forms of TB in children. However, BCG is not generally recommended in the United States because it has limited effectiveness for preventing TB in adults. The effect of BCG against XDR TB would likely be similar to the effect on drug-susceptible TB. ' "
"If I have regular (drug-susceptible) TB, how can I prevent getting 
drug-resistant TB?","'The most important thing is for you to continue taking all your TB medicines exactly as prescribed. No doses should be missed and treatment should not be stopped early. You should tell your health care provider if you are having trouble taking the medications. If you plan to travel, make sure you have enough medicine to last while away. ' "
Can XDR TB be treated and cured?,"'Yes, in some cases. Some TB control programs have shown that cure is possible for an estimated 30% of affected people. Successful outcomes depend greatly on the extent of the ''drug resistance'"", the severity of the disease, and whether the patient's immune system is weakened."" "
What are the symptoms of XDR TB?,"'The general symptoms of TB disease include feelings of sickness or ''weakness'', ''weight loss'', ''fever'', and ''night sweats''. The symptoms of TB disease of the lungs may also include ''coughing'', ''chest pain'', and ''coughing up blood''. Symptoms of TB disease in other parts of the body depend on the area affected. If you have these symptoms, you should contact your doctor or local health department. ' "
What should I do if I have been around someone who has XDR TB?,"'If you think you have been exposed to someone with TB disease, you should contact your doctor or local health department about getting a TB skin test or the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (QFT-G), a blood test. And tell the doctor or nurse when you spent time with this person. ' "
How long does it take to find out if you have XDR TB?,"'If TB bacteria are found in the sputum (''phlegm''), the diagnosis of TB can be made in a day or two, but this finding will not be able to distinguish between drug-susceptible (regular) TB and drug-resistant TB. To determine drug susceptibility, the bacteria need to be grown and tested in a laboratory. Final diagnosis for TB, and especially for XDR TB, may take from 6 to 16 weeks. ' "
Is XDR TB a problem in the United States?,"'The risk of acquiring XDR TB in the United States appears to be relatively low. However, it is important to acknowledge the ease at which TB can spread. As long as XDR TB exists, the United States is at risk and must address the threat. ' "
How many cases of XDR TB have been reported in the United States?,"'In the United States, 49 cases of XDR TB have been reported between 1993 and 2006. ' "
Is it safe to travel where cases of XDR TB have been reported?,"'Although MDR and XDR TB are occurring globally, they are still rare. ''HIV''-infected ''travelers'' are at greatest risk if they come in contact with a person with MDR or XDR TB.''All ''travelers'' should avoid high risk settings where there are no infection control measures in place. Documented places where transmission has occurred include crowded hospitals, prisons, homeless shelters, and other settings where susceptible persons come in contact with persons with TB disease. ''Air travel itself carries a relatively low risk of infection with TB of any kind. ' "
What can health care providers do to prevent XDR TB?,"""Health care providers can help prevent MDR and XDR TB by quickly diagnosing cases, following recommended treatment guidelines, monitoring patients' response to treatment, and making sure therapy is completed. ""'Providers should also ensure proper implementation of infection control procedures to prevent exposure to TB in hospitals or health-care settings where TB patients are likely to be seen. ' "
Are immigrants putting the U.S. at increased risk for TB?,"'Persons applying to enter the U.S. with immigrant or refugee visas must complete a questionnaire about any symptoms of TB they may have and obtain a chest radiograph. If positive, the person submits sputum specimens for examination for TB bacteria. Persons identified as having infectious TB are not granted entry to the United States, until they have been treated. ' "
Why haven't we heard about XDR TB before now?,"'For some years we have seen isolated cases of very highly resistant TB around the world that we would today call XDR TB. The drugs used to treat TB have been around a long time and drug resistance has taken many years to develop. Over time, countries have improved their laboratory capacity to test for drug resistance and their ability to track the number of cases. All of these factors have contributed to an increase in reporting of cases of drug-resistant TB. With more cases being identified, the problem was more closely examined, defined, and given a name. ' "
What is CDC doing to prevent XDR TB from becoming a bigger problem?,"'CDC is collaborating with other federal agencies and international partners to raise awareness and enhance strategies for TB ''prevention'' worldwide by ''SOURCE: ''Centers for Disease Control & Prevention' Strengthening TB services for people living with HIV/AIDS Assembling outbreak 
response teams Improving access to TB drugs Developing international TB testing

What is the tuberculosis skin test?,"""The tuberculosis skin test determines if someone has developed an immune response to the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). This response can occur if someone currently has TB, if they were exposed to it in the past, or if they received the BCG vaccine against TB (which is not administered in the U.S.). Estimates indicate that one-third of the world's population has latent TB, and around 1.3 million people worldwide die of TB each year. The tuberculin test or PPD (purified protein derivative) test are other names for the tuberculosis skin test.""'The tuberculin skin test is based on the fact that infection with ''M. tuberculosis'' bacterium produces a delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reaction to certain components of the bacterium. Medical professionals extract the components of the organism from TB cultures and are the core elements of the classic tuberculin PPD (also known as purified protein derivative). This PPD material is used for skin testing for tuberculosis. Reaction in the skin to tuberculin PPD begins when specialized immune cells, called T cells, sensitized by prior infection, are attracted by the immune system to the skin site where they release chemical messengers called lymphokines. These lymphokines induce induration (a hard, raised area with clearly defined margins at and around the injection site) through local vasodilation (expansion of the diameter of blood vessels) leading to fluid deposition known as ''edema'', fibrin deposition, and attraction of other types of inflammatory cells to the area.''An incubation period of two to 12 weeks is usually necessary after exposure to the TB bacteria in order for the PPD test to be positive. Anyone can have a TB test, and physicians can perform the test on infants, ''pregnant'' women, or ''HIV''-infected people with no danger. It is only contraindicated in people who have had a severe reaction to a previous tuberculin skin test.' "
How do medical professionals administer the tuberculosis skin test?,"'The standard recommended tuberculin test, known as the Mantoux test, is administered by injecting a 0.1 mL of a liquid containing 5 TU (tuberculin units) of PPD into the top layers of skin (intradermally, immediately under the surface of the skin) of the forearm. Health care providers should use a skin area that is free of abnormalities and away from veins. Typically, medical professionals make the injection using a 27-gauge needle and a tuberculin syringe. Inject the tuberculin PPD just beneath the surface of the skin. A discrete, pale elevation of the skin (a wheal) 6 mm-10 mm in diameter should be produced when the injection is done correctly. This wheal or ""bleb"" is generally quickly absorbed. If it becomes apparent that the first test was improperly administered, another test can be given at once, selecting a site several centimeters away from the original injection.' "
What is the method of reading the tuberculosis skin test?,"'""Reading"" the skin test means detecting a raised, thickened local area of skin reaction, referred to as induration. Induration is the key item to detect, not redness or ''bruising''. Read skin tests 48-72 hours after the injection when the size of the induration is maximal. Tests read after 72 hours tend to underestimate the size of the induration and are not accurate.' "
"How 
do physicians interpret skin test results?","'The basis of the reading of the skin test is the presence or absence and the amount of induration (localized swelling). A physician will measure the diameter of the induration transversely (for example, perpendicular) to the long axis of the forearm and recorded in millimeters. The area of induration (palpable, raised, hardened area) around the site of injection is the reaction to tuberculin. It is important to note that redness is not measured.''A tuberculin reaction is classified as positive based on the diameter of the induration in conjunction with certain patient-specific risk factors. In a healthy person whose immune system is normal, induration greater than or equal to 15 mm is considered a positive skin test. If ''blisters'' are present (vesiculation), the test is also considered positive.''In some groups of people, the test is considered positive if induration less than 15 mm is present. For example, an area of induration of 10 mm is considered positive in the following groups:''An induration of 5 mm is considered positive for the following groups:''On the other hand, a negative test does not always mean that a person is free of tuberculosis. People who have been infected with TB may not have a positive skin test (known as a false negative result) if their immune function is compromised by chronic medical conditions, ''cancer'' ''chemotherapy'', or ''AIDS''. Additionally, 10%-25% of people with newly diagnosed tuberculosis of the ''lungs'' will also have a negative result, possibly due to poor immune function, poor ''nutrition'', accompanying viral infection, or steroid therapy. Over 50% of patients with widespread, disseminated TB (spread throughout the body, known as miliary TB) will also have a negative TB test.''A person who received a BCG vaccine (administered in some countries but not the U.S.) against tuberculosis may also have a positive skin reaction to the TB test, although this is not always the case. This is an example of a false positive result. The positive reaction that is due to the vaccine may persist for years. Those who were vaccinated after the first year of life or who had more than one dose of the vaccine have the greatest likelihood of having a persistent positive result than those who were vaccinated as infants.''People infected with other types of mycobacteria other than ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' may also have false-positive TB skin tests.' Recent immigrants from high-prevalence areas Residents and employees of high-risk areas IV drug abusers Children under 4 years old People who work with mycobacteria in laboratories People with suppressed immune systems HIV-infected people People with changes seen on chest X-ray that are consistent with previous TB Recent contacts of people with TB People who have received organ transplants"
Are there side effects or risks from having the PPD skin test?,"'The test typically does not produce side effects. There is a very slight risk of having a severe reaction to the test, including swelling and redness of the arm, particularly in people who have had tuberculosis or been infected previously and in those who have previously had the BCG vaccine. ''Allergic'' reactions are also rare complications.''Since the test does not use live bacteria, so there is no chance of developing tuberculosis from the test.'  "
What is tuberous sclerosis?,"'Tuberous sclerosis -- also called tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) -- is a rare, multi-system ''genetic disease'' that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, ''lungs'', and skin. It usually affects the central nervous system and results in a combination of symptoms including ''seizures'', developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, and ''kidney disease''.''The disorder affects as many as 25,000 to 40,000 individuals in the United States and about 1 to 2 million individuals worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of one in 6,000 newborns. TSC occurs in all races and ethnic groups, and in both genders.''The name tuberous sclerosis comes from the characteristic ''tuber'' or potato-like nodules in the brain, which calcify with age and become hard or sclerotic. The disorder -- once known as ''epiloia'' or '""Bourneville's disease ""'-- was first identified by a French physician more than 100 years ago.''Many TSC patients show evidence of the disorder in the first year of life. However, clinical features can be subtle initially, and many signs and symptoms take years to develop. As a result, TSC can be unrecognized or misdiagnosed for years.' "
Is TSC inherited?,"'Although some individuals inherit the disorder from a parent with TSC, most cases occur as sporadic cases due to new, spontaneous mutations in TSC1 or TSC2. In this situation, neither parent has the disorder or the faulty gene(s). Instead, a faulty gene first occurs in the affected individual.''In familial cases, TSC is an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that the disorder can be transmitted directly from parent to child. In those cases, only one parent needs to have the faulty gene in order to pass it on to a child. If a parent has TSC, each offspring has a 50 percent chance of developing the disorder. Children who inherit TSC may not have the same symptoms as their parent and they may have either a milder or a more severe form of the disorder.''Rarely, individuals acquire TSC through a process called ''gonadal mosaicism'"". These patients have parents with no apparent defects in the two genes that cause the disorder. Yet these parents can have a child with TSC because a portion of one of the parent's reproductive cells (sperm or eggs) can contain the genetic mutation without the other cells of the body being involved. In cases of gonadal mosaicism, genetic testing of a blood sample might not reveal the potential for passing the disease to offspring."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of TSC?,"'TSC can affect many different systems of the body, causing a variety of signs and symptoms. Signs of the disorder vary depending on which system and which organs are involved. The natural course of TSC varies from individual to individual, with symptoms ranging from very mild to quite severe. In addition to the benign tumors that frequently occur in TSC, other common symptoms include ''seizures'', cognitive impairment, behavior problems, and skin abnormalities. Tumors can grow in nearly any organ, but they most commonly occur in the brain, kidneys, heart, lungs, and skin. ''Malignant'' tumors are rare in TSC. Those that do occur primarily affect the kidneys.''Brain involvement in TSC'' Three types of ''brain lesions'' are seen in TSC: ''cortical tubers'', for which the disease is named, generally form on the surface of the brain but may also appear in the deep areas of the brain: ''subependymal nodules'' (SEN), which form in the walls of the ventricles -- the fluid-filled cavities of the brain; and ''subependymal giant-call astrocytomas'' (SEGA), which develop from SEN and grow such that they may block the flow of fluid within the brain, causing a buildup of fluid and pressure and leading to ''headaches'' and ''blurred vision''.''TSC usually causes the greatest problems for those affected and their family members through effects on brain function. Most individuals with TSC will have seizures at some point during their life. Seizures of all types may occur, including ''infantile spasms''; tonic-clonic seizures (also known as ''grand mal'' seizures); or tonic, akinetic, atypical absence, myoclonic, complex partial or generalized squires. ''Infantile spasms'' can occur as soon as the day of birth and are often difficult to recognize. Seizures can also be difficult to control by medication, and sometimes surgery or other measures are used.''Abut one-half to two-thirds of individuals with TSC have developmental delays ranging from mild ''learning disabilities'' to severe impairment. Behavior problems, including aggression, sudden rage, ''attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'', acting out, ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'', and repetitive, destructive, or self-harming behavior occur in children with TSC and can be difficult to manage. About one-third of children with TSC meet criteria for ''autism spectrum disorder''.''Kidney problems'' such as ''cysts'' and ''angiomyolipomas'' occur in an estimated 70 to 80 percent of individuals with TSC, usually occurring between ages 15 and 30. Cysts are usually small, appear in limited numbers, and cause no serious problems. Approximately 2 percent of individuals with TSC develop large numbers of cysts in a pattern similar to ''polycystic kidney disease'' during childhood. In these cases, kidney function is compromised and ''kidney failure'' occurs. In rare instances, the cysts may bleed, leading to blood loss and ''anemia''.''Angiomyolipomas-benign growths consisting of fatty tissue and muscle cells-are the most common kidney lesions in TSC. These growths are seen in the majority of individuals with TSC, but are also found in about one of every 300 people without TSC. Angiomyolipomas caused by TSC are usually found in both kidneys and in most cases they produce no symptoms. However, they can sometimes grow so large that they cause ''pain'' or kidney failure. Bleeding from angiomyolipomas may also occur, causing both ''pain'' and ''weakness''. If severe bleeding does not stop naturally, there may severe blood loss, resulting in profound ''anemia'' and a life-threatening drop in ''blood pressure'', warranting urgent medical attention.''Other rare kidney problems include renal cell ''carcinoma'', developing from an angiomyolipoma, and oncocytomas, benign tumors unique to individuals with TSC.''Tumors called cardiac ''rhabdomyomas'' are often found in the hearts of infants and young children with TSC, and they are often seen on ''prenatal'' fetus ''ultrasound'' exams. If the tumors are large or there are multiple tumors, they can block circulation and cause death. However, if they do not cause problems at birth -- when in most cases they are at their largest size -- they usually become smaller with time and do not affect the individual in later life.''Benign tumors called ''phakomas'' are sometimes found in the eyes of individuals with TSC, appearing as white patches on the retina. Generally they do not cause ''vision loss'' or other vision problems, but they can be used to help diagnose the disease.''Additional tumors and cysts may be found in other areas of the body, including the ''liver'', lung, and pancreas. Bone cysts, ''rectal polyps'', gum fibromas, and dental pits may also occur.''A wide variety of skin abnormalities may occur in individuals with TSC. Most cause no problems but are helpful in diagnosis. Some cases may cause disfigurement, necessitating treatment. The most common skin abnormalities include:''Lung lesions are present in about one-third of adult women with TSC and are much less commonly seen in men. Lung lesions include lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and multinodular multifocal pneumocyte hyperplasia (MMPH). LAM is a ''tumor''-like disorder in which cells proliferate in the lungs, and there is lung destruction with ''cyst'' formation There is a range of symptoms with LAM, with many TSC individuals having no symptoms, while others suffer with breathlessness, which can progress and be severe. MMPH is a more benign ''tumor'' that occurs in men and women equally.'  Hypomelanic macules (""ash leaf spots""), which are white or lighter patches of skin that may appear anywhere on the body and are caused by a lack of skin pigment or melanin -- the substance that gives skin its color. Reddish spots or bumps called facial angiofibromas (also called adenoma sebaceum), which appear on the face (sometimes resembling acne) and consist of blood vessels and fibrous tissue. Raised, discolored areas on the forehead called forehead plaques, which are common and unique to TSC and may help doctors diagnose the disorder. Areas of thick leathery, pebbly skin called shagreen patches, usually found on the lower back or nape of the neck. Small fleshy tumors called ungual orsubungual fibromas that grow around and under the toenails or fingernails and may need to be surgically removed if they enlarge or cause bleeding. These usually appear later in life, ages 20-50. Other skin features that are not unique to individuals with TSC, including molluscum fibrosum or skin tags, which typically occur across the back of the neck and shoulders, café au lait spots or flat brown marks, and poliosis, a tuft or patch of white hair that may appear on the scalp or eyelids."
What causes tuberous sclerosis?,"'TSC is caused by defects, or mutations, on two genes -- TSC1 and TSC2. Only one of the genes needs to be affected for TSC to be present. The TSC1 gene, discovered in 1997, is on chromosome 9 and produces a protein called ''hamartin''. The TSC2 gene, discovered in 1993, is on chromosome 16 and produces the protein ''tuberin''. Scientists believe these proteins act in a complex as growth suppressors by inhibiting the activation of a master, evolutionarily conserved kinase called mTOR. Loss of regulation of mTOR occurs in cells lacking either hamartin or tuberin, and this leads to abnormal differentiation and development, and to the generation of enlarged cells, as are seen in TSC ''brain lesions''.' "
How is TSC diagnosed?,"'The diagnosis of TSC is based upon clinical criteria. In many cases the first clue to recognizing TSC is the presence of seizures or delayed development. In other cases, the first sign may be white patches on the skin (hypomelanotic macules) or the identification of cardiac tumor rhabdomyoma.''Diagnosis of the disorder is based on a careful clinical exam in combination with computed tomography (CT) or ''magnetic resonance imaging'' (''MRI'') of the brain, which may show tubers in the brain, and an ''ultrasound of the heart'', liver, and kidneys, which may show tumors in those organs. Doctors should carefully examine the skin for the wide variety of skin features, the fingernails and toenails for ungual fibromas, the ''teeth'"" and gums for dental pits and/or gum fibromas, and the eyes for retinal lesions. A Wood's lamp or ultraviolet light may be used to locate the hypomelantic macules which are sometimes hard to see on infants and individuals with pale or fair skin. Because of the wide variety of signs of TSC, it is best if a doctor experienced in the diagnosis of TSC evaluates a potential patient.""'In infants TSC may be suspected if the child has cardiac rhabdomyomas or seizures (infantile spasms) at birth. With a careful examination of the skin and brain, it may be possible to diagnose TSC in a very young infant. However, many children are not diagnosed until later in life when their seizures begin and other symptoms such as facial angiofibromas appear.' "
How is TSC treated?,"'There is no cure for TSC, although treatment is available for a number of the symptoms. Antiepileptic ''drugs'' may be used to control seizures. ''Vigabatrin'' is a particularly useful medication in TSC, and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of infantile spasms in TSC, although it has significant side effects. The FDA has approved the drug everolimus (Afinitor®) to treat subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA ''brain tumors'') and angiomyolipoma kidney tumors. Specific medications may be prescribed for behavior problems. Intervention programs including special schooling and occupational therapy may benefit individuals with special needs and developmental issues. Surgery may be needed in case of complications connected to tubers, SEN or SEGA, as well as in risk of hemorrhage from kidney tumors. Respiratory insufficiency due to LAM can be treated with supplemental oxygen therapy or lung transplantation if severe.''Because TSC is a lifelong condition, individuals need to be regularly monitored by a doctor to make sure they are receiving the best possible treatments. Due to the many varied symptoms of TSC, care by a clinician experienced with the disorder is recommended.''Basic laboratory studies have revealed insight into the function of the TSC genes and has led to recent use of rapamycin and related drugs for treating some manifestations of TSC. Rapamycin has been shown to be effective in treating SEGA, the ''brain tumor'' seen in TSC. However, its benefit for a variety of other aspects of and tumors seen in people with TSC is less certain, and ''clinical trials'' looking at the benefit carefully are continuing. Rapamycin and related drugs are not yet approved by the FDA for any purpose in individuals with TSC.' "
What is the prognosis?,"'The prognosis for individuals with TSC is highly variable and depends on the severity of symptoms. Those individuals with mild symptoms usually do well and have a normal life expectancy, while paying attention to TSC-specific issues. Individuals who are severely affected can suffer from severe mental retardation and persistent ''epilepsy''.''All individuals with TSC are at risk for life-threatening conditions related to the ''brain tumors'', kidney lesions, or LAM. Continued monitoring by a physician experienced with TSC is important. With appropriate medical care, most individuals with the disorder can look forward to normal life expectancy.' "
What research is being done?,"'Within the Federal Government, the leading supporter of research on TSC is the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). The NINDS, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is responsible for supporting and conducting research on the brain and the central nervous system. NINDS conducts research in its laboratories at NIH and also supports studies through grants to major medical institutions across the country. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Cancer Institute, also components of the NIH, support and conduct research on TSC.''Scientists who study TSC seek to increase our understanding of the disorder by learning more about the TSC1 and TSC2 genes that can cause the disorder and the function of the proteins-tuberin and hamartin-produced by these genes. Scientists hope knowledge gained from their current research will improve the genetic test for TSC and lead to new avenues of treatment, methods of prevention, and, ultimately, a cure for this disorder.'""Research studies run the gamut from very basic scientific investigation to clinical translational research. For example, some investigators are trying to identify all the protein components that are in the same 'signaling pathway' in which the TSC1 and TSC2 protein products and the mTOR protein are involved. Other studies are focused on understanding in detail how the disease develops, both in animal models and in patients, to better define new ways of controlling or preventing the development of the disease. Finally, ""'clinical trials'' of rapamycin are underway (with NINDS and NCI support) to rigorously test the potential benefit of this compound for some of the tumors that are problematic in TSC patients.'

What should you know about Eustachian tubes?,"'The Eustachian tube originates in the rear of the nose adjacent to the soft palate, runs a slightly uphill course, and ends in the middle ear space. The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear space to the rear of the nose near the soft palate. The middle ear space is the hollowed out portion of the skull bone that contains the ''hearing'' apparatus and is covered on one side by the eardrum.''Cartilage provides the supporting structure for the first two-thirds of the Eustachian tube, with the last third (the part closest to the middle ear space) being made of bone.''In adults, the Eustachian tube is approximately 35 mm long (1.3 inches) and approximately 3 mm in diameter (less than 1/10 inch).''The tissue that lines the Eustachian tube is similar to that inside the nasal ''cavity'' and may respond the same way (swelling and mucous production) when presented with similar stimuli. Normally, the Eustachian tube is closed, but it can become partially or completely blocked as a consequence of common colds or ''allergies''.''Partial or complete blockage of the Eustachian tube can cause sensations of popping, clicking, and ear fullness. Altitude changes can cause symptoms in persons with Eustachian tube problems. Several maneuvers can be done to improve Eustachian tube function.''The Eustachian tube was named in honor of the 16th century Italian anatomist Eustachius. Sources credit Alcmaeon of Sparta as the first to describe the structure in approximately 400 BC.'  "
What is the anatomy of Eustachian tubes (pictures)?,"'The primary function of the Eustachian tube is to ventilate the middle ear space, ensuring that its pressure remains at near normal environmental air pressure. The secondary function of the Eustachian tube is to drain any accumulated secretions, infection, or debris from the middle ear space. Several small muscles located in the back of the throat and palate control the opening and closing of the Eustachian tube. Swallowing and yawning cause contractions of these muscles located in the back of the throat and help regulate Eustachian tube function. If it were not for the Eustachian tube, the middle ear ''cavity'' would be an isolated air pocket inside the head that would be vulnerable to every change in air pressure and lead to unhealthy middle ear space function.''Normally, the nasal opening of the Eustachian tube is closed, which helps prevent the inadvertent contamination of the middle ear space by the normal secretions found in the back of the nose. A dysfunctional Eustachian tube that is always open is called a ""patulous"" Eustachian tube. Patients with this rare condition are plagued by chronic ''ear infections''. A much more common problem is a failure of the Eustachian tube to effectively regulate air pressure. Partial or complete blockage of the Eustachian tube can cause sensations of popping, clicking, and ear fullness and occasionally moderate to severe ear ''pain''. Such intense ''pain'' is most frequently experienced during sudden air pressure changes during airplane travel, particularly during take-off and landing. Young children may describe the popping sensation as ""a tickle in my ear"" or ""my ears are ''itching''.""''If the Eustachian tube function worsens, air pressure in the middle ear falls, and the ear feels full and sounds are perceived as muffled. Eventually, a vacuum is created which can then cause fluid to be drawn down the Eustachian tube into the middle ear space (termed serous ''otitis media''). If the fluid becomes infected, the common ''ear infection'' (suppurative otitis media) develops.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of blocked Eustachian tubes?,"'People with some Eustachian tube dysfunction may experience signs and symptoms, for example,'   intermittent ear fullness, ear-popping or cracking, pain, mild hearing loss (an attenuation of sound), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and occasionally poor balance"
What causes blocked Eustachian tubes?,"'Eustachian tube problems and the associated ''ear infections'' are among the most common problems seen by health-care professionals. Many people have chronic problems regulating middle ear pressure. The Eustachian tube can be blocked, or obstructed, for a variety of reasons, for example:' The most common cause is a ""cold"" (upper respiratory infection). Sinus infections and allergies may also cause swelling of the tissue lining the Eustachian tube. Simply put, a stuffy nose leads to stuffy ears. Children are particularly prone to Eustachian tube blockage because their tubes are narrower in diameter, more horizontal in orientation, and closer at the nasal opening of the Eustachian tube to the adenoids. Adenoid tissue in the back of the nose near the Eustachian tube can act as a reservoir for bacteria, contributing to recurrent ear infections. Enlarged adenoids obstructing the opening of the Eustachian tube may also be present. Adenoid removal (adenoidectomy) is frequently recommended in children with chronic ear infections (chronic otitis media). Rarely, masses or tumors in the skull base or nasopharynx can lead to Eustachian tube obstruction. Excessively small Eustachian tubes (as may afflict children with Down Syndrome) Smoking is associated with damage to the cilia that sweep mucus and debris from the middle ear space via the Eustachian tube to the back of the nose where it may be expelled. Causes of Eustachian tube dysfunction range from allergies to excessively small Eustachian tubes (as may afflict children with Down Syndrome)."
"What home remedies treat pain, function, and help clear blocked Eustachian tubes?","'Several maneuvers may be done to improve the Eustachian tube function and thus aid in the equalization of air pressure.' The simple act of swallowing activates the muscles in the back of the throat that help open the Eustachian tube. Any activity that promotes swallowing can help open the Eustachian tube, for example, chewing gum, drinking, or eating. Yawning is even more effective because it is a stronger muscle activator. If the ears still feel full, the person can try to forcibly open the Eustachian tube by taking a deep breath and blowing while pinching your nostrils and closing the mouth. When a ""pop"" is felt, you know you have succeeded. If problems persist despite trying to forcibly open the tubes you may need to seek medical attention. If you feel dizzy performing this maneuver, then stop and discuss this with your doctor. If you have a cold, sinus infection, ear infection, or suffering from allergies, it may be advisable to postpone air travel. Similarly, individuals with Eustachian tube problems may find such sports as scuba diving painful, and in some situations quite dangerous. Babies traveling on airplanes cannot intentionally pop their ears but may do so if they are sucking on a bottle or pacifier. Crying, similar in function to yawning, will also enable equalization of air pressure."
What is the medical treatment for Eustachian tube dysfunction?,"'An evaluation with an ''allergy'' specialist or Allergist may be helpful in diagnosing the cause of the Eustachian tube dysfunction or blockage.'   Many people with Eustachian tube blockage or dysfunction that travel use a decongestant pill or nasal spray an hour prior to takeoff, and if necessary, prior to descent. The decongestant acts to shrink the membranes lining the nose and throat, allowing the ears to equalize more easily. Similarly, people experiencing chronic daily problems with Eustachian tube dysfunction can benefit from aggressive control of allergies (with antihistamines, decongestants, and prescription nasal sprays). Acid reflux control may help some people if their reflux is irritating the lining in the back of the nose and Eustachian tube opening."
Will surgery cure Eustachian tube dysfunction?,"'In severe situations, a ""pressure equalization tube"" (PET) can be surgically placed in the eardrum, replacing the role of a functioning Eustachian tube, and thus guaranteeing equalization of middle ear pressure. This procedure is most commonly seen in young children who experience recurrent ear infections as a consequence of a poorly functioning Eustachian tube.' "
What changes can you make to avoid Eustachian tube dysfunction at altitudes?,"   A rapid change in altitude, and thus air pressure is equalized across the eardrum by a normally functioning Eustachian tube. A healthy tube opens frequently and widely enough to equalize these changes in air pressure. With altitude changes during the descent of an airplane, air pressure increases as the plane lowers. The air pressure change pushes the eardrum inward (retraction). Persons with Eustachian tube blockage can develop the fullness of the ear, dulled hearing, and possibly pain when this occurs. Those with poorly functioning Eustachian tubes may experience similar symptoms when riding in elevators, driving through the mountains, or diving to the bottom of a swimming pool. Scuba divers learn tricks to equalize their ear pressures."
Introduction to birth control,"'\tThe terminology used to describe ''birth control methods'' include: ''contraception'', ''pregnancy'' ''prevention'', ''fertility'' control, and ''family planning''. But no matter what the terminology, sexually active people can choose from an abundance of methods to reduce the possibility of their ''becoming pregnant''. Nevertheless, no method of ''birth control'' available\xa0today offers perfect protection against sexually transmitted infections (''sexually transmitted diseases'', or ''STDs''), except abstinence.''\tIn simple terms, all methods of ''birth control'"" are based on either preventing a man's sperm from reaching and entering a woman's egg (""'fertilization'"") or preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the woman's uterus (her womb) and starting to grow. New methods of birth control are being developed and tested all the time. And what is appropriate for a couple at one point may change with time and circumstances.""'\tUnfortunately, no birth control method, except abstinence, is considered to be 100% effective.' "
Permanent methods of contraception (surgical sterilization),"'\tSterilization is considered a permanent method of contraception. In certain cases, sterilization can be reversed, but the success of this procedure is not guaranteed. For this reason, sterilization is meant for men and women who do not intend to have children in the future.' "
Vasectomy,"'\tA ''vasectomy'' is a form of sterilization of a man. A vasectomy ensures that no sperm will exit from his penis when he ejaculates during sexual intercourse.''\tA vasectomy is usually performed by either a ''urologist'' or a general surgeon. Under local anesthesia, the vas deferens (tubes that carry sperm from the testicles into the urethra, also known as ductus deferens) from each testicle is severed. The open ends are then closed off. A vasectomy can be performed in the clinic and involves making two small openings in the scrotum. After a vasectomy, the man may feel tenderness or ''bruising'' around the incision site.''\tA vasectomy does not interfere with the ability of a man to have an erection or the quantity of his ejaculation fluid. After a man has a vasectomy, another second form of birth control should be used until his ejaculate fluid is found to be free from sperm. This usually takes 10 to 20 ejaculations.''\tVasectomy reversals are possible, but they tend to be expensive and are not guaranteed to be effective. A vasectomy should be considered a permanent form of birth control.''\tA vasectomy does not protect a man or his partner from sexually transmitted infections.' "
Tubal ligation (tubes tied),"'Tubal ligation is also known as ""having one\'s tubes tied,"" or having a ""tubal."" Tubal ligation is for women, and like a vasectomy, should be considered a permanent form of birth control.'""A tubal ligation is performed under general, regional, or local anesthesia and can be performed as an outpatient procedure. The surgeon or OB/GYN\xa0uses one of several procedures in order to access a woman's Fallopian tubes (which run from the top part of her uterus to each ovary). A ""'laparoscopy'' is a procedure in which a small incision is made\xa0just below the navel. A viewing tube (scope) can then be inserted through this incision to view and reach the Fallopian tubes. A minilaparotomy is a small incision in the lower abdomen is sometimes used for tubal ligation as an alternative to a laparoscopic procedure.'""Once the doctor has access to a woman's Fallopian tubes, they are closed off by using a clip, tying and cutting, or cauterizing (burning) the tubes. The procedure takes anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes.""'Side effects of a tubal ligation may include infection, bleeding (hemorrhage), and any effects or complications associated with being under general anesthesia.'""A tubal ligation blocks a woman's Fallopian tubes. As a result of the procedure, about 1 inch of each tube is blocked off. An egg can no longer travel down the tube to the uterus, and sperm cannot make contact with the egg. Tubal ligation should have no effect on a woman's ""'menstrual cycle'' or hormone production.'""A woman's tubal ligation can be surgically reversed, usually with more success than in men who have had a vasectomy. About 14% of women in the US seek information about a reversal of tubal ligation.""'A tubal ligation does not protect a woman or her partner from sexually transmitted infections (sexually transmitted diseases, or ''STDs''). It is also not an absolute method of birth control because a small percentage of women become ''pregnant'' after a tubal ligation. Pregnancy after tubal ligation is uncommon (occurring in less than 2% of women), and the risk of pregnancy appears to be related to age (younger women have more post-tubal ligation ''pregnancies'') as well as the type of procedure used for the sterilization.' "
Hysteroscopic sterilization,"""\tHysteroscopic sterilization is a nonsurgical form of permanent birth control in which a physician inserts a 4-centimeter (1.6 inch) long metal coil into each one of a woman's two Fallopian tubes via a scope passed through the cervix into the uterus (hysteroscope), and from there into the openings of the Fallopian tubes. Over the next few months, tissue grows over the coil to form a plug that prevents fertilized eggs from traveling from the ovaries to the uterus.""""\tThe procedure takes about 30 minutes, can be done in a doctor's office, and usually requires only a local anesthetic. During a 3-month period after the coils are inserted, women must use other forms of birth control until their physician verifies by an imaging test known as a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) that the Fallopian tubes are completely blocked.""'\tLike tubal ligation, this form of sterilization is permanent (not reversible) and is designed as an alternative to surgical sterilization which requires general anesthesia and an incision. About 6% of women who have the procedure develop side effects, mainly due to improper placement of the coils.''\tThis form of sterilization, like other methods of surgical sterilization, does not protect a woman or her partner from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).' "
Hysterectomy,"'A ''hysterectomy'"" is the surgical removal of a woman's uterus and, depending on her overall health status and the reason for the operation, perhaps her ovaries as well. For practical purposes, no woman who has had a hysterectomy can become pregnant; it is an irreversible method of birth control and absolute sterilization. A laparoscopic hysterectomy (removal of the uterus through tiny incisions in the abdomen through which instruments are placed) is possible when there are no complications and no suspicion of ""'cancer''. A supra-cervical hysterectomy, which spares the cervix and removes the upper part of the uterus, is also a common surgical technique.''If a woman has other chronic medical problems that may be helped by a hysterectomy (such as abnormally excessive menstrual bleeding, ''uterine fibroids'', ''uterine growths''), than this may be an appropriate procedure for her to consider. Otherwise, contraception should be considered a secondary benefit and not a sole reason to have the procedure.' "
What is tularemia?,"'Tularemia is an infection caused by the Gram-negative bacteria ''Francisella tularensis''. The organism is named after Edward Francis who, while in Tulare County, California, helped discover how the disease was spread and how the causative organism could be cultured.''Tularemia is usually a disease of animals. Humans can acquire tularemia when they come in contact with infected animals or are bitten by insects that have fed on an infected animal. ''Ticks'', biting flies, and mosquitoes have been shown to transmit tularemia between animals and humans. Tularemia is one of several tick-borne diseases and can be spread by many species of ticks, including ''Dermacentor variabilis'' and ''Amblyomma americana''. Among biting flies, the deer fly (''Chrysops'' spp.) is the most widely cited insect that transmits the disease (vector). Even small doses of these bacteria (10-50 bacteria) have the potential to cause severe disease. For this reason, ''F. tularensis'' has the potential to be used as a bioweapon.' "
What are the different types of tularemia?,"'There are four subspecies of ''F. tularensis'', and all are capable of causing disease in humans (''F. tularensis, F. holarctica, F. mediasiatica'', and'' F. novicida''). The subspecies ''tularensis'' and ''holarctica'' are the most common causes of tularemia in humans. The type of tularemia depends on which subspecies is involved and how the organism was acquired. Disease caused by the subspecies ''F. holarctica'' is often milder than that caused by ''F. tularensis''.''The type of disease is often named for the most prominent symptoms. Thus, ulceroglandular tularemia is usually caused by inoculation of the skin and is associated with open sores and ''swollen lymph nodes''. If there is no sore but swollen ''lymph nodes'' are prominent, the disease may be classified as glandular. If the eye or throat is involved, oculoglandular or pharyngeal tularemia is said to be present. Disease involving the ''lungs'' is termed pneumonic disease. Tularemia that predominately affects the bloodstream and body organs is referred to as typhoidal tularemia. Some researchers classify tularemia into two groups: ulceroglandular and typhoidal. However, others classify seven different types according to where they occur:' Ulceroglandular: cutaneous ulcers Glandular: regional adenopathy Oculoglandular: conjunctivitis Oropharyngeal: mouth and oral cavity Intestinal: abdominal organs Pneumonic: lungs Typhoidal: general feverish (febrile) illness"
What causes tularemia?,"'Tularemia is caused by the bacterium ''Francisella tularensis''. Tularemia is an uncommon disease in humans, with statistics showing less than one case per million people per year in the U.S. This translates into less than 150 cases per year, with a majority in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. Illness caused by ticks and insects is most common in the summer months and often occurs in children. Disease caused in winter is associated with hunters who handle dead animals. ''F. tularensis'' can infect many types of animals but particularly affects rabbits, hares, and rodents. The disease is sometimes called rabbit fever because it occurs when hunters contact the skin of infected rabbits. Farmers, veterinarians, foresters, landscape workers, and hunters are at risk of contracting tularemia because of their likely direct animal contact, but the disease can also affect others who inadvertently come into contact with animals or are bitten by insects.''Tularemia is usually acquired directly by skinning, eating, or otherwise handling infected animals. In rare instances, transmission has occurred when wild rodents (prairie ''dogs'') were sold as pets. Dried animal material may be aerosolized and inhaled, causing disease. Domestic animals such as cats may pick up the organism on their claws after killing a wild rodent or rabbit. Dogs and cats may also eat contaminated meat, causing fever and swollen nodes. Transmission of tularemia from dogs or cats to humans is rare. Finally, the disease has been transmitted by drinking water contaminated with animal products. Contaminated food and water have been responsible for large outbreaks in times of war.'  "
What are risk factors for tularemia?,"'Risk factors for tularemia include bites from almost any kind of animal (for example, domesticated dogs or cats can become infected, rodents, wild rabbits), tick bites, aerosols created from animal carcasses and/or bioweapons, handling animal carcasses (for example, skinning animals, sheering sheep), being a veterinarian, landscaper, hiker, or hunter, and eating or drinking contaminated foods.' "
What are tularemia symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms usually appear three to five days after the organism is acquired, although longer incubation periods (14 days) have been reported. Patients become ill suddenly and have ''influenza''-like symptoms with fever, aches, and ''fatigue'', and ''headache''. A nonspecific ''rash'' may occur. Fever may be high, and may go away for a short time only to return. Untreated, the fever usually lasts about four weeks.''Other symptoms depend on the type of tularemia. In ulceroglandular tularemia, a red nodule appears at the site of inoculation and eventually forms an open sore associated with swollen lymph nodes. If untreated, the sore and the swollen lymph nodes resolve slowly over a period of months. Lymph nodes may become filled with pus (suppurate) and require drainage. In glandular tularemia, there is significant swelling of a group of lymph nodes but no detectable sore. The eye is infected (oculoglandular disease) when touched by contaminated hands, causing ''pain'', swelling, and discharge. Oculoglandular disease is accompanied by swollen lymph nodes around the ear and neck.''Pharyngeal tularemia is usually acquired through eating or drinking and causes a ''sore throat''. Necrotic tissue and pus often line the throat, and the lymph nodes of the neck are swollen.''Typhoidal tularemia causes infection of many organs and the bloodstream. Patients with typhoidal tularemia may experience ''diarrhea'' or ''jaundice''. As the disease progresses, the ''liver'' and spleen may become enlarged. ''Pneumonia'' may occur at presentation or may be a late complication. In severe disease, the kidneys and other organs may fail.''Pneumonic tularemia is caused by inhalation of infected material or by spread of the organism to the lung from other sites. Inhalation may occur while farming, mowing a yard (mowing over dead rodents), or sheering sheep. Laboratory workers may become infected when material is inadvertently aerosolized in the lab. Pneumonia may occur in any of the types of tularemia but is especially common in typhoidal tularemia.' "
"Is tularemia contagious, and what is the contagious period for tularemia?","'Tularemia is not transmitted from person to person, so there is no contagious period for tularemia. However, some medical authors consider tularemia to be highly contagious to humans from environmental sources because of the small number of bacteria it takes to cause potentially lethal infections. Contagiousness from environmental sources can be long-lived, as the organisms can survive in cool, moist environments for weeks or months.' "
What is the incubation period for tularemia?,'The incubation period for tularemia (the time it takes to develop signs and symptoms after exposure to the organisms) varies with the size of the inoculum; as few as 10 organisms may cause infection. The average incubation period is about two to six days but can range from one to 21 days.' 
What types of specialists treat tularemia?,"'Specialists who help diagnose and treat tularemia are infectious-disease specialists, critical-care specialists, and pulmonologists. Other specialists may be consulted depending upon where the organisms spread inside the body. (For example, a cardiologist may be consulted if pericarditis develops.)' "
How do health-care professionals diagnose tularemia?,"'The first step in diagnosing tularemia is to suspect the disease. Because tularemia is rare, physicians may not think to ask about a history of ''tick bite'' or an occupational exposure such as hunting. Tissues or blood may be sent for culture, which requires special media. It is critical to warn the laboratory that tularemia is suspected because the organism poses a threat to laboratory workers. More rapid diagnosis may be obtained through use a ''polymerase chain reaction'' (''PCR'') test, although this may be falsely negative in up to one-third of cases. Other rapid tests under study include special fluorescent stains, tests that detect parts of the bacteria in the urine, and experimental tests for bacterial RNA. Infected patients make antibodies against ''F. tularensis'' and these antibodies may be detected in the blood after the first week of illness. High titers of antibodies indicate a high likelihood of disease. However, antibodies may simply represent disease that happened in the remote past rather than an acute illness.' "
What is the treatment for tularemia?,"'Tularemia is treated with a drug called streptomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic. The drug is given intramuscularly, twice a day, for one to two weeks. The antibiotic gentamicin is an alternative drug and may be given intravenously. Neither of these drugs is effective against meningitis because they do not penetrate from the bloodstream into the brain. In tularemic meningitis, it may be necessary to put gentamicin directly into the fluid that bathes the brain.''The oral medications ''doxycycline'' (''Vibramycin'') or ''tetracycline'' (Sumycin) may work but are less effective than streptomycin. The disease may relapse after treatment with these pills. Other drugs, such as ''ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro''), are effective in the test tube but have not been widely used in patients. However, one outbreak in Spain with 142 patients showed good clinical outcomes with ciprofloxacin; fluoroquinolone antibiotics may be useful in treating tularemia if additional studies show clinical effectiveness.' "
Are there home remedies for tularemia?,'There are no home remedies for tularemia. It is a relatively rare disease but can quickly become fatal (60% of individuals infected may die from it) if not treated with appropriate antimicrobials.' 
Is there a vaccine for tularemia?,"'There is no vaccine for tularemia currently licensed in the U.S. An older vaccine made from a weakened strain of ''F. tularensis'' had many other problems and was withdrawn. There is great interest in developing a new vaccine, not only to protect those at high risk for disease (lab workers or researchers who routinely handle the bacteria), but also for counterterrorism to reduce the threat of biological warfare. The National Institutes of Health is funding several research projects to develop an effective vaccine against ''F. tularensis''.''If a person is exposed to tularemia in a high-risk situation, such as in a laboratory accident, a two-week course of doxycycline or ciprofloxacin pills is recommended. Exposures from tick bites or other low-risk settings do not require preventive antibiotics.''To prevent and/or reduce the risk of tularemia, hunters should not handle wild animals with their bare hands. If a pet brings a killed rodent inside, the rodent should not be touched by the person who disposes of it. Tick bites can be avoided by wearing long pants and sleeves. Hikers should check themselves for ticks every day. If a tick is found on the body, it should not be removed with bare hands. Insect bites may be minimized by using insect repellents.' "
What is the prognosis for tularemia?,"'The prognosis for tularemia may range from good to poor, depending upon the type of tularemia and how quickly it is properly treated. Untreated tularemia is fatal in up to 60% of cases and is often due to organ failure. With treatment, deaths are rare and the mortality rate is less than 5%. However, many patients have fatigue that continues for months after the infection resolves. Less common complications of tularemia include meningitis, bone infection, or infection of the heart.' "
Tularemia and bioterrorism,"'F. tularensis'' can be freeze-dried and made into a powder which can be aerosolized. This makes it a potential source of bioterrorism similar to ''anthrax'', ''botulism'', or ''brucellosis'' because it could be delivered to large numbers of people. Once inhaled, it is estimated that more than 80% of people would become infected and 6% would die. Inhalation of only about 10-50 bacteria can cause disease. If the number of people exposed was large enough, infected people would overwhelm the health-care system and infected soldiers would be unable to fight. Tularemia is difficult to diagnosis, and few people are immune to the disease.' "
Where can people find more information about tularemia?,"'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""Tularemia""''https://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/''United States Department of Labor, Occupational Safety & Health Administration''http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/tularemia/index.html' "
Introduction to Liposuction,"""Liposuction is a cosmetic procedure that removes fat that you can't seem to get rid of through ""'diet'' and ''exercise''.''A ''plastic'' or dermatologic surgeon usually does the procedure on your hips, belly, thighs, buttocks, back, arms, or face to improve their shape. But liposuction can also be done with other plastic surgeries, including facelifts, breast reductions, and tummy ''tucks''.'  "
Am I a Good Candidate?,"""You'll want to have realistic expectations. Liposuction won't get rid of ""'cellulite'"", so if you hoped you'd come out of surgery without any, you're out of luck.""'Liposuction is a surgical procedure, and with it comes risks. So you need to be in good health before you get it. That means you must at least:'""Doctors don't recommend the procedure if you have health problems with blood flow or have ""'heart disease'', ''diabetes'', or a weak immune system.' Be within 30% of your ideal weight Have firm, elastic skin Not smoke"
What Should I Know Beforehand?,"'The first step is to consult with your surgeon. Talk about your goals, the options, the risks and benefits, and the costs. Ask all your questions.''If you decide to go ahead with liposuction, your surgeon will give you instructions on how to prepare for it. These may include ''diet'' and ''alcohol'' restrictions.''Tell your surgeon about any ''allergies'' you have and any medications you take, including ''over-the-counter'' and herbal ''supplements''. She will likely recommend you stop taking certain meds, such as blood thinners and certain painkillers several weeks before surgery.' "
What Should I Expect?,"""Your liposuction may take place at your doctor's office or a surgery center. Make sure that the place where you're getting it done is accredited, and is known for its professional standards, safety and good results."" You'll go home the day of the procedure. Make sure to have someone drive you home afterward. (If you're having a lot of fat removed, you should get the surgery done in a hospital, where you might stay overnight). Before your liposuction starts, your doctor might mark the areas of your body that will be treated. She may also take photos to use later for before-and-after comparisons. Next you'll get general anesthesia -- which means you will not be awake during the procedure -- or a ""local,"" which means you will be awake but not feel any pain."
Types of Liposuction,"'There are just a few different liposuction techniques. But what they all have in common is the use of a thin tube, called a cannula, connected to a vacuum to suction the fat from your body.''Tumescent liposuction'' is the most common technique. Your surgeon injects a sterile solution into the area where the fat is to be removed. It consists of saline -- which is salt water -- along with ''lidocaine'' and epinephrine. The solution makes it easier to suction the fat with less blood loss and ''pain''.''Ultrasound''-assisted liposuction, or UAL'', uses sound waves energy under your skin to rupture the cell walls of the fat. This liquefies the fat so it can be suctioned out.''Laser-assisted liposuction, or SmartLipo'', uses a laser to produce a burst of energy to liquefy the fat.' "
How Long Is Recovery?,"'You might not have to stay in the hospital depending on the type of surgery you had. But you should expect ''bruising'', swelling, and soreness for at least a few weeks.''Your surgeon may require you to wear a compression garment for 1 to 2 months after surgery to control swelling.'""You'll probably also have to take some antibiotics to prevent infection. Most people can return to work within a few days and get back to normal activities within 2 weeks. But every person is different.""'Ask your ''plastic surgeon'' specific questions about what your recovery will be like, including:'  What medications will I need to take? Will I wear bandages? Will I have stitches, and when will they be removed? When can I exercise again? Do I need to come back for a follow-up visit?"
What Are the Risks?,"'Cosmetic surgery'' is still surgery, so there are some risks. You can help reduce them by making sure it is done only by a specially trained, board-certified cosmetic surgeon.''There are several possible risks directly related to liposuction that you still have to consider, including:''Another risk is a ''blood clot'' in your deep veins. Clots can be very dangerous if they travel to other parts of your body, such as your lungs.' Bleeding Complications from anesthesia Shock (usually from not getting enough fluid during surgery) Fluid accumulation (pockets of fluid forming under the skin) Infections (strep, staph) Fat embolism (when tiny pieces of fat break away and block blood flow) Burns from instruments Uneven fat removal Reactions to lidocaine Change in skin sensation; numbness Damage to nerves, blood vessels, muscles, lungs, and abdominal organs"
Are the Results Permanent?,"'The fat cells are removed permanently during liposuction. But you can gain weight back, with new fat cells, which usually go to different areas of your body.''To keep your new shape after surgery, follow a diet that includes lots of lean protein, fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy. And exercise regularly.' "
Is Liposuction Covered By Health Insurance?,"""Because liposuction is a cosmetic procedure, most health plans don't cover it. Talk to your insurance company and your surgeon about the costs and payment options, as well as who pays if you have any complications."" "
Introduction,"""Are sit-ups just not giving you the taut tummy you desire? If you've got a little too much flab or excess skin in your abdomen that won't diminish with ""'diet'' or ''exercise'', you may want to consider an abdominoplasty, popularly referred to as a ""tummy tuck.""''This procedure flattens your abdomen by removing extra fat and skin, and tightening muscles in your abdominal wall.'""However, this is a major surgery. So if you're considering it, take the time to educate yourself, thoroughly analyze your own situation and do not rush to make the final decision.""'A tummy tuck should be the last resort for people who have exhausted all other measures, and the procedure should not be used as an alternative to ''weight loss''.' "
Who Are the Best Candidates For a Tummy Tuck?,"'A tummy tuck is suitable for both men and women who are in good overall general health.''It should not be confused with a  ''liposuction''  (the ''cosmetic surgery'' used to remove fat deposits), although your surgeon may elect to perform liposuction as part of a tummy tuck.''Women who have muscles and skin stretched by multiple ''pregnancies'' may find the procedure useful to tighten those muscles and reduce that skin. A tummy tuck is also an alternative for men or women who were ''obese'' at one point in their lives and still have excessive fat deposits or loose skin in the abdominal area.' "
Who Should Not Consider a Tummy Tuck?,"""If you're a woman who is still planning to have children, then you may want to postpone a tummy tuck until you're through bearing children. Here's why: During surgery, your vertical muscles are tightened. Future pregnancies can separate these muscles.""'Are you still planning to lose a lot of weight? If so, you do not want to consider a tummy tuck.'""It's important to note that a tummy tuck can cause prominent, permanent scarring. If this is something you don't want, you may want to reconsider. Your doctor will discuss all these options with you when you go for the consultation."" "
How a Tummy Tuck is Done,"'Depending on your desired results, this surgery can take anywhere from one to five hours. The complexity of your particular situation also will determine whether you have it completed as an in-patient or outpatient procedure.''You will receive general anesthesia, which will put you to ''sleep'"" during the operation. It's important to have someone with you who can drive you home. If you live alone, you also will need someone to stay with you at least the first night after the surgery.""'There are two options for a tummy tuck. You and your surgeon will discuss your desired results, and he or she will determine the appropriate procedure during your consultation.''Complete abdominoplasty.'' Your abdomen will be cut from hipbone to hipbone in this procedure, the option for those patients who require the most correction. The incision will be made low, at about the same level as your pubic hair.''Your surgeon will then manipulate and contour the skin, tissue and muscle as needed. Your ''belly button'"" will have a new opening if you undergo this procedure, because it's necessary to free your navel from surrounding tissue. Drainage tubes may be placed under your skin and these will be removed in a few days as your surgeon sees fit.""'Partial or mini abdominoplasty.'' Mini-abdominoplasties are often performed on patients whose fat deposits are located below the navel and require shorter incisions. ''During this procedure, your belly button most likely will not be moved. Your skin will be separated between the line of incision and your belly button. This type of surgery may also be performed with an endoscope (small camera on the end of a tube). The procedure may only take up to two hours, again, depending on your own personal situation and the complexity of your needs.' "
How to Prepare For Tummy Tuck Surgery,"'If you smoke, you will have to stop for a certain period as determined by your doctor. It is not enough to just cut down on ''smoking''. You must stop completely for at least two weeks prior to surgery and for two weeks after. ''Smoking'' can increase the risk of complications and delay healing.''Make sure you eat well-balanced, complete meals and do not try to ''diet'' excessively before the surgery. Proper ''nutrition'' plays a key role in healing properly. ''If you take certain medications, your surgeon may instruct you to stop taking these for a certain period before and after the surgery. Your surgeon will determine this as part of your pre-operative consultation.'""Before undergoing the surgery, you'll need to get your home ready for your post-operative care. Your home recovery area should include:""'You know yourself best, so make sure you set up the safest, most comfortable recovery area before you undergo the surgery to meet your personal needs.' Plenty of ice packs Supply of loose, comfortable clothing that can be taken on and off very easily Petroleum jelly for incision sites Telephone within reaching distance Hand-held shower head and bathroom chair"
What Are the Complications and Side Effects of Tummy Tuck Surgery?,"'As expected, you will have ''pain'' and swelling in the days following surgery. Your doctor can prescribe a painkiller, if needed, and will instruct you on how to best handle the ''pain''. Soreness may last for several weeks or months.''You may also experience numbness, ''bruising'' and overall ''tiredness'' for that same time period.'""As with any surgery, there are risks. Remember, this surgery affects a very crucial part of your body. Though they're rare, complications can include infection, bleeding under the skin flap or ""'blood clots'' that could travel to your lung and interfere with your ''breathing''. You may carry an increased risk of complications if you have poor circulation, ''diabetes'' or ''heart'', lung or ''liver disease'' or a history of blood clots.''You may experience insufficient healing, which can cause more significant scarring or loss of skin. If you do heal poorly, you may require a second surgery.''As we mentioned before, the ''scars'"" from a tummy tuck are fairly prominent and though they may fade slightly, they will never completely disappear. Your surgeon may recommend certain creams or ointments to use after you've completely healed to help with the scars."" "
Taking Care of Yourself After Surgery,"""Whether you're having a partial or complete tummy tuck, your incision site will be stitched and bandaged. It's very important that you follow all your surgeon's instructions on how to care for the bandage in the days following surgery. The bandage used will be a firm, elastic band that promotes proper healing. Your surgeon will also instruct you on how to best position yourself while sitting or lying down to help ease pain.""'If you are an exceptionally physically active person,you will have to severely limit strenuous ''exercise'' for at least six weeks. Your doctor will advise you on this as you go through the process. You may need to take up to one month off of work after the surgery to ensure proper recovery. Again, your doctor will help you determine this based on your personal situation.' "
Return to Living,"""Generally, most people love the new look after they've undergone this procedure. However, you may not feel like your normal self for months after the surgery. You've gone through a tremendous amount to make this happen, both emotionally and physically, and it's very important that you follow proper diet and exercise to maintain your new look."" "
Does Insurance Cover a Tummy Tuck?,"'Insurance carriers generally do not cover elective, ''cosmetic surgery''. However, your carrier may cover a certain percentage if you have a ''hernia'' that will be corrected through the procedure, or your anterior muscles are abnormally spread.'""It's extremely important that you begin communicating with your insurance company early on, and that you discuss your insurance concerns with your surgeon. In most cases, your surgeon will write a letter to your insurance carrier, making the case for medical necessity, if it applies to you.""""It's also very important to realize that insurance may only cover certain portions of the surgery, so make sure you get details. With any cosmetic surgery, this may affect future insurance coverage for you and your premiums may increase.""'Reviewed by the doctors at The Cleveland Clinic, Department of ''Plastic Surgery''.''Edited by  Charlotte E.

What is a pheochromocytoma?,"'Pheochromocytomas are a type of tumor of the adrenal glands that can release high levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine. As the name implies, the adrenalglands are located near the ""renal"" (kidney) area.\xa0 One adrenal gland sits on top of each of the two kidneys.''Despite their small size, the adrenal glands have many functions. They are complex endocrine (hormone secreting) glands. Cells in different regions of the adrenal glands have different functions in the endocrine system.The outer portion of the adrenal gland is called the adrenal cortex. In part of the adrenal cortex (zona fasciculata and zona reticularis) the cells secrete cortisol, a hormone similar to cortisone, which is essential for handling stresses In another area (zona glomerulosa) cells secrete a hormone called aldosterone which helps in water and salt regulation and ''blood pressure'' control.''The inner area of the adrenal gland is referred to as the adrenal medulla. This is where the cells secrete substances called catecholamines -- epinephrine, norepinephrine and ''dopamine''. These are ""flight or fight"" hormones. They are responsible in part for that feeling of an ""adrenaline"" rush people feel when they are afraid. It is these cells that are overproduced by a pheochromocytoma. Basically, a pheochromocytoma is a tumor of these catecholamine-secreting cells, and that causes the clinical signs and symptoms we will discuss below. The catecholamine-secreting cells are sometimes referred to as chromaffin cells, and they are found in other areas of the body as well as in the adrenal medulla.''Sometimes, pheochromocytomas arise from chromaffin cells that are located outside of the adrenal gland. In this case, they are termed extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas and are usually located in the abdomen.''Pheochromocytomas may occur in persons of any age. The peak incidence is between the third and the fifth decades of life. Pheochromocytomas are, fortunately, quite rare, and most of them are benign.'  "
What are the symptoms of a pheochromocytoma?,"'Someone with a pheochromocytoma usually has three classic symptoms -- ''headache'', ''sweating'', and ''heart'' ''palpitations'' (a ''fast heart beat'') in association with markedly elevated blood pressure (''hypertension''). Other conditions that may accompany these classic symptoms are as follows: ''anxiety'', ''nausea'', ''tremors'', ''weakness'', ''abdominal pain'', and ''weight loss''.''Some people, however, never develop symptoms of a pheochromocytoma. Up to 10% of cases are discovered incidentally, meaning that they are not suspected and only found when the patient is undergoing diagnostic studies for other conditions. In some cases, the ''high blood pressure'' comes and goes and may be difficult to document. In other cases, the blood pressure is consistently elevated and easily recorded.''Pheochromocytomas are present in only about 0.2% of all people with ''high blood pressure''. There are certain conditions, however, in which the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma may rank high on the list of possibilities; they are discussed below.' "
What conditions are associated with pheochromocytomas?,"'Pheochromocytomas can be a component of certain familial or genetic syndromes. The most common familial condition is called multiple endocrine neoplasia, or MEN for short. Two types of MEN -- MEN 2A and 2B -- are associated with pheochromocytomas. Both are genetic syndromes that run in families and are transmitted from parent to child in an autosomal dominant manner.''Pheochromocytomas are not the only tumors that occur in MEN 2A and 2B. MEN 2A carries an increased risk of tumors of the parathyroids, glands near the thyroid that help to regulate calcium levels in the body. And both MEN 2A and 2B elevate the risk of medullary ''carcinoma of the thyroid'' - an unusual type of\xa0 ''thyroid cancer''. In families where MEN is suspected, genetic testing can be done to help identify family members at risk.''Pheochromocytomas are a feature of other genetic disorders, including von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and ''neurofibromatosis type 1''. Both of these disorders are associated with the development of numerous benign and malignant tumors.''There are also many individuals who have pheochromocytomas with no known family history of them. These cases are termed sporadic. In general, if these patients have bilateral disease (pheochromocytomas in both adrenal glands) or are diagnosed before the age of 21, genetic screening is recommended.' "
What else can cause the symptoms of a pheochromocytoma?,"'Basically, anything that can cause over activity of the sympathetic nervous system can be on the list of diagnoses to rule out when suspecting a pheochromocytoma. The sympathetic system is the main control panel governing the release of the ""flight or fight"" response in response to ''stress'' or fear, as mentioned above. Things that can stimulate this include ''drugs'' (even excessive use of decongestants should be considered); withdrawal from drugs (such as suddenly stopping certain blood pressure medications); ''panic attacks'', and spinal cord injuries are among the many conditions that can also lead to some of the symptoms seen in pheochromocytomas.' "
How is pheochromocytoma diagnosed?,"'Pheochromocytoma is a possibility in anyone with the classic triad of symptoms -- ''headache'', sweating, and heart ''palpitations'' -- especially when there is ''high blood pressure'' (though high blood pressure is not always present). A physician becomes more suspicious if the patient is young and has no other risk factors or habits that may cause these findings.''Perhaps the patient knows their family history well and can inform their doctor of other types of endocrine tumors, including pheochromocytoma(s) diagnosed in family members. Consequently, a doctor suspecting familial pheochromocytoma can go straight to genetic testing. However, in most cases, if suspicion is high, the physician proceeds with a series of tests to measure the culprit hormones and their breakdown products (metabolites) listed below.''First, hormones such as catecholamines and metanephrines are measured in a 24 hour urine collection, and metanephrines may also be measured in the blood. If these are greater than 2 times the normal level, imaging studies are usually done to look at the adrenal glands.''If imaging with ''MRI'' or ''CT scans'' of the adrenal glands shows a mass in the gland (or outside it), surgery may be done. If it is not clear that the mass is actually functional and related to the findings clinically, or if there is no mass seen on imaging, another test can be performed. This test called a 131-I-MIBG scan is quite specific for pheochromocytomas. In this test a radioactive ''iodine'' molecule is injected into the bloodstream and localized in the area of the tumor, allowing visualization of the pheochromocytoma on imaging studies.' "
How is a pheochromocytoma treated?,"'Surgery is the definitive treatment. Until the tumor is removed, control of blood pressure is a top priority. Controlling blood pressure before and during surgery is the trickiest part of care. There is a chance of developing an acute hypertensive crisis (a potentially dangerous, sudden, and severe rise in blood pressure) after anesthesia is given during the surgery. The blood pressure is therefore managed with special medications both prior to and during surgery and is carefully monitored throughout the procedure. Consultation with an endocrinologist is recommended to help design treatment for individual patients.''Because of the types of hormones involved in a pheochromocytoma, first attempts at blood pressure control utilize agents of a specific class of drugs known as alpha blockers. These agents are used prior to use of ''beta blockers'' to balance and best control the blood pressure response to anesthesia.''In the rare instances of pheochromocytomas that are malignant,and not cured by surgery, then ''chemotherapy'' or ''radiation therapy'' may be required after surgery. Trials of very specific or ""targeted"" new drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown some promise in the treatment of pheochromocytoma and are under study in ''clinical trials''. As yet, drug therapy for this disease cannot offer a possible cure, but may benefit the patient by reducing symptomsand sometimes prolonging life.' "
What is the prognosis with a pheochromocytoma?,"'Pheochromocytoma is benign in most cases, and if blood pressure-related surgical complications can be avoided, the likelihood of cure is excellent. Both malignant and benign pheochromocytomas can recur after surgery. The statistics vary from one study to the next, but recurrence rates average around 10%. Therefore, long-term follow-up care after surgery is very important to keep outlooks fair to good with additional appropriate treatments of medicine or surgery.''In the low percent of these already rare tumors in which malignant behavior is evident, survival may still be quite prolonged, as the pace of the disease may still be slow. Participation in clinical trials of new therapies is strongly encouraged in the unfortunate case of metastatic pheochromocytoma. Should a pheochromocytoma be diagnosed during ''pregnancy'', the mortality (death risk) is increased for both the mother and the fetus. Referral as soon as possible to a major center with experience with this circumstance is recommended.' "
What is brain cancer?,"'Brain cancer is a disease of the brain in which cancer cells (''malignant'' cells) arise in the brain tissue (cancer of the brain). Cancer cells grow to form a mass of cancer tissue (tumor) that interferes with brain functions such as muscle control, sensation, memory, and other normal body functions. Tumors composed of cancer cells are called malignant tumors, and those composed of mainly noncancerous cells are called benign tumors. Cancer cells that develop from brain tissue are called primary ''brain tumors'' while tumors that spread from other body sites to the brain are termed metastatic or secondary ''brain tumors''. Statistics suggest that brain cancer occurs infrequently (1.4% of all new cancer patients per year), so it is not considered to be a common illness and is likely to develop in about 23,770 new people per year with about 16,050 deaths as estimated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the American Cancer Society. Only about 5% of brain tumors may be due to hereditary genetic conditions such as ''neurofibromatosis'', tuberous sclerosis, and a few others.'  "
What are the types of brain cancers?,"'The most common primary brain tumors are usually named for the brain tissue type (including brain stem cancers) from which they originally developed.' Five brain tumors are gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, vestibular schwannomas, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (medulloblastomas).Gliomas have several subtypes, which include astrocytomas (for example, an astrocytoma is a brain cancer composed of abnormal brain cells known as astrocytes), oligodendrogliomas, ependymomas, and choroid plexus papillomas. Glioblastomas arise from astrocytes and are usually highly aggressive (malignant) tumors; doctors diagnosed Senator John McCain with this form of brain tumor. Gliomas have several subtypes, which include astrocytomas (for example, an astrocytoma is a brain cancer composed of abnormal brain cells known as astrocytes), oligodendrogliomas, ependymomas, and choroid plexus papillomas. Glioblastomas arise from astrocytes and are usually highly aggressive (malignant) tumors; doctors diagnosed Senator John McCain with this form of brain tumor. These names all reflect different types of cells in the normal brain that can become cancers. When the grades are coupled with the tumor name, it gives doctors a better understanding of the severity of brain cancer. For example, a grade III (anaplastic) glioma is an aggressive tumor, while an acoustic neuroma is a grade I benign tumor. However, even benign tumors can cause serious problems if they grow big enough to cause increased intracranial pressure or obstruct vascular structures or cerebrospinal fluid flow."
What are four grades of brain cancers?,"""Not all brain tumors are alike, even if they arise from the same type of brain tissue. Tumors are assigned a grade depending on how the cells in the tumor appear microscopically. The grade also provides insight as to the cell's growth rate. NCI lists the following grades from benign to most aggressive (grade IV):"" Grade I: The tissue is benign. The cells look nearly like normal brain cells, and they grow slowly. Grade II: The tissue is malignant. The cells look less like normal cells than do the cells in a grade I tumor. Grade III: The malignant tissue has cells that look very different from normal cells. The abnormal cells are actively growing and have a distinctly abnormal appearance (anaplastic). Grade IV: The malignant tissue has cells that look most abnormal and tend to grow quickly."
What are the stages of brain cancer?,"'Brain cancers are staged (stage describes the extent of the cancer) according to their cell type and grade because they seldom spread to other organs, while other cancers, such as breast or ''lung cancer'', are staged according to so-called TMN staging which is based on the location and spread of cancer cells. In general, these cancer stages range from 0 to 4; with stage 4 indicating the cancer has spread to another organ (highest stage is 4).' "
What is metastatic brain cancer?,"'Cancer cells that develop in a body organ such as the lung (primary cancer tissue type) can spread via direct extension, or through the lymphatic system and/or through the bloodstream to other body organs such as the brain. Tumors formed by such cancer cells that spread (metastasize) to other organs are called metastatic tumors. Metastatic brain cancer is a mass of cells (tumor) that originated in another body organ and has spread into the brain tissue. Metastatic tumors in the brain are more common than primary brain tumors. They are usually named after the tissue or organ where the cancer first developed (for example, metastatic lung or ''breast cancer'' tumors in the brain, which are the most common types found). Occasionally, an abbreviated name may be used that often confuses people; for example, ""small cell brain cancer"" actually means ""''small cell lung cancer'' that has metastasized to the brain."" People should not hesitate to ask their doctor about any terms they do not understand or about the origin of their cancer.' "
What causes brain cancer?,"'Primary brain tumors arise from many types of brain tissue (for example, glial cells, astrocytes, and other brain cell types). Metastatic brain cancer is caused by the spread of cancer cells from a body organ to the brain. However, the causes for the change from normal cells to cancer cells in both metastatic and primary brain tumors are not fully understood. Data gathered by research scientists show that people with certain risk factors are more likely to develop brain cancer.''Individuals with risk factors, such as having a job in an oil refinery, handlers of jet fuel or chemicals like benzene, chemists, embalmers, or rubber-industry workers, show higher rates of brain cancer than the general population. Some families have several members with brain cancer, but heredity (genetic passage of traits from parents to children) as a cause for brain tumors has not been proven. Other risk factors such as ''smoking'', ''radiation'' exposure, and viral infection (''HIV'') have been suggested but not proven to cause brain cancer. There is no good evidence that brain cancer is ''contagious'', caused by head ''trauma'', or caused by cell phone use. Although many lay press and web articles claim that ''aspartame'' (an ''artificial sweetener'"") causes brain cancer, the FDA maintains that it does not cause brain cancer and base their findings on over 100 toxicological and clinical studies regarding the sweetener's safety."" "
Do cell phones cause brain cancer?,"'There is an ongoing concern by a number of people that cell phones cause brain cancer. Some reports in the popular press and some web sites suggest that avoiding cell phone use and using a macrobiotic ''diet'' will help avoid brain cancer. This situation has been exacerbated by a recent ruling to put cell phones on a list of items that ""may"" cause cancer by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). This was done because the IARC suggested that an increase in gliomas may occur with high use of cell phones. The IARC classified cell phones as group 2b carcinogens; these substances are considered possibly carcinogenic, but evidence is limited in both humans and experimental animals. The report does not say that cell phones cause brain cancer.''Currently, many researchers are convinced there is no good evidence for these cancer-causing claims. In December 2010, a large study of about 59,000 cell phone users, with use times ranging over five to 10 years, indicated that no substantial change in brain cancer incidence could be found in these individuals. Investigators suggest that ""high usage"" of cell phones over long time periods is yet to be investigated. With over 5 billion phones in use and no significant increase in gliomas (the most frequent type of brain cancer) reported worldwide, many investigators think that normal cell use likely causes no harm. However, for those readers who want to minimize any electromagnetic radiation dose from cell phones, the reader can consult the web for a list of phones that produce the highest and lowest radiation levels (for example, ''http://reviews.cnet.com/2719-6602_7-291-2.html?tag=page;page''). In addition, the use of earphones or the speaker function will allow usage without the phone having close proximity to the brain. The American Cancer Society has a detailed review of most of the major studies done on this topic to date (''http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/athome/cellular-phones''). In addition, the National Cancer Institute has an up-to-date article that discusses the ""cell phone and cancer risk"" controversy in great detail (''http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet'').' "
What are brain cancer symptoms and signs?,"'Although there are few early warning signs, the most common signs and ''symptoms of brain cancer'' may include one or more of the following:''Other common symptoms that can occur include''These symptoms can also occur in people who do not have brain cancer, and none of these symptoms alone or in combination can predict that a person has brain cancer. Cancer can occur in any part of the brain (for example, occipital, frontal, parietal, or temporal lobes, brainstem, or meningeal membranes [meninges; singular is meninx]). Primary cerebral ''lymphoma'' can occur but is rare; so are craniopharyngiomas that are derived from the ''pituitary gland''. A few brain cancers may produce few or no symptoms (for example, some meningeal and pituitary gland tumors).'   Difficulty walking and/or dizziness/vertigo Seizures Muscle weakness (for example, arm and leg weakness) Headaches (persistent and/or severe) nausea, vomiting, blurry vision, a change in a person's alertness, sleepiness, mental capacity reduction and/or confusion, memory problems, changes in speech, such as difficulty speaking, impaired voice, or inability to speak, personality changes, hallucinations, weakness on one side of the body, coordination problems, fatigue, and pins and needles sensations and/or reduced sensation of touch."
What type of doctors treat brain cancer?,"""Usually, the patient's primary care physician or pediatrician helps to coordinate the treatment team of doctors to individually treat the patient. The treatment team may consist of oncologists, neurologists, radiation oncologists, neurosurgeons, and additional personnel like occupational and physical therapists and possibly speech therapists, depending upon the outcome of initial treatments. For patients who have terminal and/or inoperable brain cancer, ""'hospice'' and other organizations may help the patient and their family and friends coordinate supportive care.' "
What tests do doctors use to diagnose brain cancer?,"'The initial test is an interview that includes a medical history and physical examination of the person by a health care provider. The results of this interaction will determine if other specific tests need to be done.''The most frequently used test to detect brain cancer is a ''CT scan'' (''computerized tomography''). This test resembles a series of ''X-rays'' and is not painful, although sometimes a dye needs to be injected into a vein for better images of some internal brain structures. Another test that is gaining popularity because of its high sensitivity for detecting anatomic changes in the brain is MRI (''magnetic resonance imaging''). This test also shows the brain structures in detail better than CT. If the tests show evidence (tumors or abnormalities in the brain tissue) of brain cancer, then other doctors such as neurosurgeons and neurologists that specialize in treating brain ailments will be consulted to help determine what should be done to treat the patient. Occasionally, a tissue sample (biopsy) may be obtained by surgery or insertion of a needle to help determine the diagnosis. Other tests (white blood cell counts, ''electrolytes'"", or examination of cerebrospinal fluid to detect abnormal cells or increased intracranial pressure) may be ordered by the health care practitioner to help determine the patient's state of health or to detect other health problems. These tests help differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous conditions in the brain that may produce similar symptoms (for example, Hippel-Lindau disease or diseases in the spinal cord or the nervous system outside of the brain)."" "
What is the treatment for brain cancer?,"""A treatment plan is individualized for each brain cancer patient. The treatment plan is constructed by the doctors who specialize in brain cancer, and treatments vary widely depending on the cancer type, brain location, tumor size, patient age, and the patient's general health status. A major part of the plan is also determined by the patient's wishes. Patients should discuss treatment options with their health care providers.""'Surgery, ''radiation therapy'', and chemotherapy are the major treatment categories for most brain cancers. Individual treatment plans often include a combination of these treatments. Surgical therapy attempts to remove all of the tumor cells by cutting the tumor away from normal brain tissue. This surgery that involves opening the skull (craniotomy) is often termed invasive surgery to distinguish it from noninvasive radiosurgery or radiation therapy described below. Some brain cancers are termed inoperable by surgeons because attempting to remove the cancer may cause further ''brain damage'' or death. However, a brain cancer termed inoperable by one surgeon may be considered operable by another surgeon. Patients with a diagnosis of an inoperable brain tumor should consider seeking a second opinion before surgical treatment is abandoned.'""Radiation therapy attempts to destroy tumor cells by using high-energy radiation focused onto the tumor to destroy the tumor cells' ability to function and replicate. Radiosurgery is a nonsurgical procedure that delivers a single high dose of precisely targeted radiation using highly focused gamma-ray or X-ray beams that converge on the specific area or areas of the brain where the tumor or other abnormality is located, minimizing the amount of radiation to healthy brain tissue. Equipment used to do radiosurgery varies in its radiation source; a gamma knife uses focused gamma rays, and a linear accelerator uses photons, while heavy-charged particle radiosurgery uses a proton beam. Tomotherapy is a type of radiotherapy in which radiation is delivered in a highly precise and individualized manner that minimizes radiation exposure to healthy tissue; it has also been used to treat brain cancer.""'Chemotherapy attempts to destroy tumor cells using chemicals (''drugs'') that are designed to destroy specific types of cancer cells. There are many chemical agents used; specific drug therapies are numerous, and each regimen is usually designed for the specific type of brain cancer and individualized for each patient. For example, bevacizumab (''Avastin'') is a drug approved for treatment of glioblastomas (''glioblastoma'' multiforme). Chemotherapy can be administered intrathecally (into the cerebrospinal fluid by a ''spinal tap'' or through a surgically placed permanent reservoir under the ''scalp'' attached through a sterile tubing placed into the fluid-containing chambers in the brain), by IV administration, and biodegradable chemically impregnated polymers. All treatments attempt to spare normal brain cells.''Other treatment options may include hyperthermia (heat treatments), immunotherapy (immune cells directed to kill certain cancer cell types), or steroids to reduce inflammation and brain swelling. These may be added on to other treatment plans.''Clinical trials'' (treatment plans designed by scientists and physicians to try new chemicals or treatment methods on patients) can be another way for patients to obtain treatment specifically for their cancer cell type. Clinical trials are part of the research efforts to produce better treatments for all disease types. Stem cell treatments for brain and brain stem cancers and other conditions may be available, because research with patients is ongoing using these potential therapies. The best treatment for brain cancer is designed by the team of cancer specialists in conjunction with the wishes of the patient.' "
Are there any home remedies for brain cancer?,"'There are many home remedies that make claims of being effective in treating brain cancer (and many other cancers). Most are ''nutrition'' or ''supplements'' like herbs, fish oils, chokeberry, and many others. Most have little or no research data to support their claims. Before using such compounds, discuss their use with your doctors.' "
What are the side effects of brain cancer treatment?,"'Side effects of brain cancer treatment vary with the treatment plan (for example, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation) and the overall health status of the patient. Most treatment plans try to keep all side effects to a minimum. For some patients, the side effects of brain cancer treatment can be severe. Treatment plans should include a discussion of potential side effects and the likelihood of them developing, so the patient and their caregivers (family, friends) can make appropriate treatment decisions in conjunction with their medical team. Also, if side effects develop, the patient has some knowledge of what to do about them such as when to take certain medicines (for example, ''anti-nausea'' medication is frequently given) or when to call their doctor to report health changes.''Surgical side effects include an increase in current symptoms, damage to normal brain tissue, brain swelling, and seizures. Other symptoms of changes in brain function such as muscle weakness, mental changes, and decreases in any brain-controlled function can occur. Combinations of these side effects may happen. The side effects are most noticeable shortly after surgery but frequently decline over time. Occasionally, the side effects do not go away.''Chemotherapy usually affects (damages or kills) rapidly growing cancer cells but also can affect normal tissue. Chemotherapy is usually given intravenously so the drugs can reach most body organs. Common side effects of chemotherapy are nausea, vomiting, ''hair loss'', and loss of energy. The immune system is often ''depressed'' by chemotherapy, which results in a high susceptibility to infections. Other systems, such as the kidneys and the reproductive organs, may also be damaged by chemotherapy and are complications of therapy. Most of the side effects decline over time, but some may not.''Radiation therapy has most of the same side effects as chemotherapy. Most radiation therapy is focused onto the brain cancer tissue, so some systems do not receive direct radiation (immune system, kidneys, and others). The effects on systems not receiving the direct radiation are usually not as severe as those seen with chemotherapy. However, hair and skin are usually affected, resulting in ''hair loss'' (sometimes permanently) and reddish and darkened skin that needs protection from the sun.'  "
What is the prognosis of treated brain cancer?,"'Survival of treated brain cancer varies with the cancer type (low-grade versus aggressive and/or inoperable, for example), location, overall age, and general health of the patient. In general, most treatment plans seldom result in a cure. Reports of survival rate or life expectancy greater that five years (which is considered to be long-term survival) vary from less than about 5% to a high of 86%, no matter what treatment plan is used; recovery (cure) from brain cancer is possible, but realistically, complete recovery does not occur often. However, about 75% of children will survive pediatric brain cancer longer than five years; often because of chronic diseases, the elderly have poorer outcomes except with the lowest grade tumors.'""So, why use any treatment plan? Without treatment, brain cancers are usually aggressive and result in death within a short time span. Treatment plans can prolong survival and can improve the patient's quality of life for some time. Again, the patient and caregivers should discuss the prognosis when deciding on treatment plans.""'In general, life expectancy in patients with brain cancer is usually described as a survival rate five years after diagnosis. The survival rate is expressed as a percentage of people still alive five years after the diagnosis and/or treatment. The survival rates vary with the type and grade of brain cancer and the age of the patient. For example, glioblastomas in patients aged 20-44 have a five-year survival rate of 19% and only a 5% rate in patients aged 55-64. In contrast, patients with a meningioma (a benign brain tumor) in the same age groups have survival rates of 87% and 71%, respectively. These survival rates change as advancements in treatment plans improve; the patient and his/her doctors should discuss these rates as they are only estimates, and each person is different. Survival with no reoccurrence of the disease after five years is considered a cure by some; however, close follow-up with doctors is usually recommended to quickly evaluate any possible recurrence of the cancer.'  "
What can I do to help my family (and me) cope with my diagnosis of brain cancer?,"""Discuss your concerns openly with your doctors and family members. It is common for brain cancer patients to be concerned about how they can continue to lead their lives as normally as possible; it is also common for them to become anxious, depressed, and angry. Most people cope better when they discuss their concerns and feelings. Although some patients can do this with friends and relatives, others find solace in support groups (people who have brain cancer and are willing to discuss their experiences with other patients) composed of people who have experienced similar situations and feelings. The patient's treatment team of doctors should be able to connect patients with support groups. In addition, information about local support groups is available from the American Cancer Society at ""'http://www.cancer.org/docroot/home/index.asp'' or the American Brain Tumor Association at ''https://www.abta.org/''.' "
Is it possible to prevent brain cancer?,"'Although there is no way to prevent brain cancers, early diagnosis and treatment of tumors that tend to metastasize to the brain may reduce the risk of metastatic brain tumors. The following factors have been suggested as possible risk factors for primary brain tumors: radiation to the head, ''HIV'' infection, and environmental toxins. However, no one knows the exact causes that initiate brain cancer, especially primary brain cancer, so specific preventive measures are not known. Although web sites and popular press articles suggest that macrobiotic diets, not using cell phones, and other methods will help prevent brain cancer, there is no reliable data to support these claims.' "
Where can I get more information about my type of brain cancer?,"""There are many types of brain cancer. For more specific information about a cancer type, questions and discussions with the patient's treatment team are the best way to obtain specific information. Also, there are many online resources available about brain cancer types. Often, these resources provide additional detailed information about pathology, statistics, treatments, and support groups for brain cancer patients."" "
What is tumor grade?,"'Tumor grade is the description of a tumor based on how abnormal the tumor cells and the tumor tissue look under a microscope. It is an indicator of how quickly a tumor is likely to grow and spread. If the cells of the tumor and the organization of the tumor\'s tissue are close to those of normal cells and tissue, the tumor is called ""well-differentiated."" These tumors tend to grow and spread at a slower rate than tumors that are ""undifferentiated"" or ""poorly differentiated,"" which have abnormal-looking cells and may lack normal tissue structures. Based on these and other differences in microscopic appearance, doctors assign a numerical ""grade"" to most cancers. The factors used to determine tumor grade can vary between different types of cancer.''Tumor grade is not the same as the stage of a cancer. Cancer stage refers to the size and/or extent (reach) of the original (primary) tumor and whether or not cancer cells have spread in the body. Cancer stage is based on factors such as the location of the ''primary tumor'', tumor size, regional ''lymph node'' involvement (the spread of cancer to nearby ''lymph nodes''), and the number of tumors present.'  "
How is tumor grade determined?,"'If a tumor is suspected to be ''malignant'"", a doctor removes all or part of it during a procedure called a biopsy. A pathologist (a doctor who identifies diseases by studying cells and tissues under a microscope) then examines the biopsied tissue to determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant. The pathologist also determines the tumor's grade and identifies other characteristics of the tumor."" "
How are tumor grades classified?,"'Grading systems differ depending on the type of cancer. In general, tumors are graded as 1, 2, 3, or 4, depending on the amount of abnormality. In Grade 1 tumors, the tumor cells and the organization of the tumor tissue appear close to normal. These tumors tend to grow and spread slowly. In contrast, the cells and tissue of Grade 3 and Grade 4 tumors do not look like normal cells and tissue. Grade 3 and Grade 4 tumors tend to grow rapidly and spread faster than tumors with a lower grade.''If a grading system for a tumor type is not specified, the following system is generally used (1):' GX: Grade cannot be assessed (undetermined grade) G1: Well differentiated (low grade) G2: Moderately differentiated (intermediate grade) G3: Poorly differentiated (high grade) G4: Undifferentiated (high grade)"
What are some of the cancer type-specific grading systems?,"'Breast and ''prostate cancers'' are the most common types of cancer that have their own grading systems.''Breast cancer''. Doctors most often use the Nottingham grading system (also called the Elston-Ellis modification of the Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grading system) for ''breast cancer''. This system grades breast tumors based on the following features:''Each of the categories gets a score between 1 and 3; a score of ""1"" means the cells and tumor tissue look the most like normal cells and tissue, and a score of ""3"" means the cells and tissue look the most abnormal. The scores for the three categories are then added, yielding a total score of 3 to 9. Three grades are possible:''Prostate cancer''. The Gleason scoring system is used to grade ''prostate cancer'' (1). The ''Gleason score'' is based on biopsy samples taken from the prostate. The pathologist checks the samples to see how similar the tumor tissue looks to normal prostate tissue. Both a primary and a secondary pattern of tissue organization are identified. The primary pattern represents the most common tissue pattern seen in the tumor, and the secondary pattern represents the next most common pattern. Each pattern is given a grade from 1 to 5, with 1 looking the most like normal prostate tissue and 5 looking the most abnormal. The two grades are then added to give a Gleason score. The American Joint Committee on Cancer recommends grouping Gleason scores into the following categories (1):' Tubule formation: how much of the tumor tissue has normal breast (milk) duct structures Nuclear grade: an evaluation of the size and shape of the nucleus in the tumor cells Mitotic rate: how many dividing cells are present, which is a measure of how fast the tumor cells are growing and dividing Total score = 3-5: G1 (Low grade or well differentiated) Total score = 6-7: G2 (Intermediate grade or moderately differentiated) Total score = 8-9: G3 (High grade or poorly differentiated) Gleason X: Gleason score cannot be determined Gleason 2-6: The tumor tissue is well differentiated Gleason 7: The tumor tissue is moderately differentiated Gleason 8-10: The tumor tissue is poorly differentiated or undifferentiated"
How does tumor grade affect a patient's treatment options?,"""Doctors use tumor grade and other factors, such as cancer stage and a patient's age and general health, to develop a treatment plan and to determine a patient's prognosis (the likely outcome or course of a disease; the chance of recovery or recurrence). Generally, a lower grade indicates a better prognosis. A higher-grade cancer may grow and spread more quickly and may require immediate or more aggressive treatment.""""The importance of tumor grade in planning treatment and determining a patient's prognosis is greater for certain types of cancer, such as ""'soft tissue sarcoma'', primary ''brain tumors'', and breast and ''prostate cancer''.''Patients should talk with their doctor for more information about tumor grade and how it relates to their treatment and prognosis.'

What are brain tumors?,'A tumor in the brain isn’t like tumors in other parts of your body. It has limited room for growth because of the skull. This means that a growing tumor can squeeze vital parts of the brain and lead to serious health problems. Learning about the possible symptoms of brain tumors can help you know when to tell a doctor about them.' 
What are the early warning symptoms and signs of a brain tumor?,"'Cancer that has spread to the brain from another part of the body is called a metastatic brain tumor. Metastatic brain tumors are much more common than primary tumors.\xa0''The symptoms of a brain tumor depend on tumor size, type, and location. Symptoms may be caused when a tumor presses on a nerve or harms a part of the brain. Also, they may be caused when a tumor blocks the fluid that flows through and around the brain, or when the brain swells because of the buildup of fluid.''The most common early warning symptoms and signs of brain tumors include:''Most often, these symptoms are not due to a brain tumor. Another health problem could cause them. If you have any of these symptoms, you should tell your doctor so that problems can be diagnosed and treated early before it has grown. Some people with brain tumors have seizures, especially in someone who does not have a history of seizures.'   A new onset or change in pattern of headaches Headaches in the morning Headaches that gradually become more frequent and severe Nausea and vomiting for no reason Changes in speech, vision, or hearing Problems balancing or walking Changes in mood, personality, or ability to concentrate Problems with memory Muscle jerking or twitching (seizures or convulsions) Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs Gradual loss of sensation or movement in an arm or a leg Confusion in everyday matters Personality or behavior changes"
What are the types of benign and cancerous brain tumors?,"""When most normal cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. New cells form when the body doesn't need them, and old or damaged cells don't die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor. There are two types of brain tumors, primary and cancerous.""   Primary brain tumors can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).Usually, benign tumors can be removed, and they seldom grow back.Benign brain tumors usually have an obvious border or edge. Cells from benign tumors rarely invade tissues around them.They don't spread to other parts of the body.Benign tumors can press on sensitive areas of the brain and cause serious health problems.Unlike benign tumors in most other parts of the body, benign brain tumors are sometimes life threatening.Benign brain tumors may become turn into cancer.

Unlike benign tumors in most other parts of the body, benign brain tumors are sometimes life threatening. Benign brain tumors may become turn into cancer. Malignant brain tumors (also called brain cancer) contain cancer cells:Malignant brain tumors are generally more serious and often are a threat to life.They are likely to grow rapidly and crowd or invade the nearby healthy brain tissue.Cancer cells may break away from malignant brain tumors and spread to other parts of the brain or to the spinal cord. They rarely spread to other parts of the body. Malignant brain tumors are generally more serious and often are a threat to life. They are likely to grow rapidly and crowd or invade the nearby healthy brain tissue. Cancer cells may break away from malignant brain tumors and spread to other parts of the brain or to the spinal cord. They rarely spread to other parts of the body."
What are the grades for benign and cancerous brain tumors?,"'Doctors group brain tumors by grade. The grade of a tumor refers to the way the cells look under a microscope:''Cells from low-grade tumors (grades I and II) look more normal and generally grow more slowly than cells from high-grade tumors (grades III and IV).\xa0Over time, a low-grade tumor may become a high-grade tumor. However, the change to a high-grade tumor happens more often among adults than children.' Grade I: The tissue is benign. The cells look nearly like normal brain cells, and they grow slowly. Grade II: The tissue is malignant. The cells look less like normal cells than do the cells in a Grade I tumor. Grade III: The malignant tissue has cells that look very different from normal cells. The abnormal cells are actively growing (anaplastic). Grade IV: The malignant tissue has cells that look most abnormal and tend to grow quickly."
What are the common types and grades for primary brain tumors?,"'There are many types of primary brain tumors. Primary brain tumors are named according to the type of cells or the part of the brain in which they begin. For example, most primary brain tumors begin in glial cells. This type of tumor is called a glioma.''Among adults, the most common types are:''Among children, the most common types and stages of brain tumors\xa0are:'   Astrocytoma: The tumor arises from star-shaped glial cells called astrocytes. It can be any grade. In adults, an astrocytoma most often arises in the cerebrum.Grade I or II astrocytoma: It may be called a low-grade glioma.Grade III astrocytoma: It's sometimes called a high-grade or an anaplastic astrocytoma.Grade IV astrocytoma: It may be called a glioblastoma or malignant astrocytic glioma. Grade I or II astrocytoma: It may be called a low-grade glioma. Grade III astrocytoma: It's sometimes called a high-grade or an anaplastic astrocytoma. Grade IV astrocytoma: It may be called a glioblastoma or malignant astrocytic glioma. Meningioma: The tumor arises in the meninges. It can be grade I, II, or III. It's usually benign (grade I) and grows slowly. Oligodendroglioma: The tumor arises from cells that make the fatty substance that covers and protects nerves. It usually occurs in the cerebrum. It's most common in middle-aged adults. It can be grade II or III. Medulloblastoma: The tumor usually arises in the cerebellum. It's sometimes called a primitive neuroectodermal tumor. It is grade IV. Grade I or II astrocytoma: In children, this low-grade tumor occurs anywhere in the brain. The most common astrocytoma among children is juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma. It's grade I. Ependymoma: The tumor arises from cells that line the ventricles or the central canal of the spinal cord. It's most commonly found in children and young adults. It can be grade I, II, or III. Brain stem glioma: The tumor occurs in the lowest part of the brain. It can be a low-grade or high-grade tumor. The most common type is diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma."
What are the causes and risk factors for brain tumors?,"""When you're told that you have a brain tumor, it's natural to wonder what may have caused your disease. But no one knows the exact causes of brain tumors. Doctors seldom know why one person develops a brain tumor and another doesn't.""'Researchers are studying whether people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop a brain tumor. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of getting a disease.''Studies have found the following risk factors for brain tumors:''Researchers are studying whether using cell phones, having had a ''head injury'', or having been exposed to certain chemicals at work or to magnetic fields are important risk factors. Studies have not shown consistent links between these possible risk factors and brain tumors, but additional research is needed.' Ionizing radiation: Ionizing radiation from high dose x-rays (such as radiation therapy from a large machine aimed at the head) and other sources can cause cell damage that leads to a tumor. People exposed to ionizing radiation may have an increased risk of a brain tumor, such as meningioma or glioma. Family history: It is rare for brain tumors to run in a family. Only a very small number of families have several members with brain tumors."
What procedures and tests diagnose the type and grade of a brain tumor?,"'If you have symptoms that suggest a brain tumor, your doctor will give you a physical exam and ask about your personal and family health history. You may have one or more of the following tests:''However, if the tumor is in the brain stem or certain other areas, the surgeon may not be able to remove tissue from the tumor without harming normal brain tissue. In this case, the doctor uses MRI, CT, or other imaging tests to learn as much as possible about the brain tumor.' Neurologic exam: Your doctor checks your vision, hearing, alertness, muscle strength, coordination, and reflexes. Your doctor also examines your eyes to look for swelling caused by a tumor pressing on the nerve that connects the eye and the brain. MRI: A large machine with a strong magnet linked to a computer is used to make detailed pictures of areas inside your head. Sometimes a special dye (contrast material) is injected into a blood vessel in your arm or hand to help show differences in the tissues of the brain. The pictures can show abnormal areas, such as a tumor. CT scan: An x-ray machine linked to a computer takes a series of detailed pictures of your head. You may receive contrast material by injection into a blood vessel in your arm or hand. The contrast material makes abnormal areas easier to see. Your doctor may ask for other tests: Angiogram: Dye injected into the bloodstream makes blood vessels in the brain show up on an x-ray. If a tumor is present, the x-ray may show the tumor or blood vessels that are feeding into the tumor. Spinal tap: Your doctor may remove a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that fills the spaces in and around the brain and spinal cord). This procedure is performed with local anesthesia. The doctor uses a long, thin needle to remove fluid from the lower part of the spinal column. A spinal tap takes about 30 minutes. You must lie flat for several hours afterward to keep from getting a headache. A laboratory checks the fluid for cancer cells or other signs of problems. Biopsy: The removal of tissue to look for tumor cells is called a biopsy. A pathologist looks at the cells under a microscope to check for abnormal cells. A biopsy can show cancer, tissue changes that may lead to cancer, and other conditions. A biopsy is the only sure way to diagnose a brain tumor, learn what grade it is, and plan treatment. Surgeons can obtain tissue to look for tumor cells in two ways:Biopsy at the same time as treatment: The surgeon takes a tissue sample when you have surgery to remove part or all of the tumor. See the Surgery section.Stereotactic biopsy: You may get local or general anesthesia and wear a rigid head frame for this procedure. The surgeon makes a small incision in the scalp and drills a small hole (a burr hole) into the skull. CT or MRI is used to guide the needle through the burr hole to the location of the tumor. The surgeon withdraws a sample of tissue with the needle. A needle biopsy may be used when a tumor is deep inside the brain or in a part of the brain that can't be operated on.

Why do I need a biopsy? How will the biopsy results affect my treatment plan? What kind of biopsy will I have? How long will it take? Will I be awake? Will it hurt? What are the chances of infection or bleeding after the biopsy? Are there any other risks? How soon will I know the results? If I do have a brain tumor, who will talk with me about treatment? When?"
Should you ask for a second opinion before you start treatment for a brain tumor?,"'Before starting treatment, you might want a second opinion about your diagnosis and treatment plan. Some people worry that the doctor will be offended if they ask for a second opinion. Usually the opposite is true. Most doctors welcome a second opinion. And many health insurance companies will pay for a second opinion if you or your doctor requests it. Some companies require a second opinion.'""If you get a second opinion, the doctor may agree with your first doctor's diagnosis and treatment plan. Or the second doctor may suggest another approach. Either way, you'll have more information and perhaps a greater sense of control. You can feel more confident about the decisions you make, knowing that you've looked at your options.""""It may take some time and effort to gather your medical records and see another doctor. In many cases, it's not a problem to take several weeks to get a second opinion. The delay in starting treatment usually won't make treatment less effective. To make sure, you should discuss this delay with your doctor. Some people with a brain tumor need treatment right away.""'There are many ways to find a doctor for a second opinion. You can ask your doctor, a local or state medical society, a nearby hospital, or a medical school for names of specialists.''Also, you can request a consultation with specialists at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.' Adults and children with a brain tumor: Specialists in the NCI Neuro-Oncology Branch provide consultations. The telephone number is 301-594-6767 or 866-251-9686. Children with a brain tumor: Specialists in the NCI Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Section of the Pediatric Oncology Branch provide consultations. The telephone number is 301-496-8009 or 877-624-4878."
What are the treatments for benign and cancerous brain tumors?,"'People with brain tumors have several treatment options. The options are surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Many people get a combination of treatments.''The choice of treatment depends mainly are:''For some types of ''brain cancer'', the doctor also needs to know whether cancer cells were found in the cerebrospinal fluid.''Your doctor can describe your treatment choices, the expected results, and the possible side effects. Because cancer therapy often damages healthy cells and tissues, side effects are common. Before treatment starts, ask your health care team about possible side effects and how treatment may change your normal activities. You and your health care team can work together to develop a treatment plan that meets your medical and personal needs.''You may want to talk with your doctor about taking part in a clinical trial, a research study of new treatment methods. See the Taking Part in Cancer Research section.''Your doctor may refer you to a specialist, or you may ask for a referral. Specialists who treat brain tumors include neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and neuroradiologists.''Your health care team may also include an oncology nurse, a registered dietitian, a ''mental health'' counselor, a social worker, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, a speech therapist, and a physical medicine specialist. Also, children may need tutors to help with schoolwork. (The Rehabilitation section has more information about therapists and tutors.)''Can you recommend other doctors who could give me a second opinion about my treatment options? How often should I have checkups?'   The type and grade of brain tumor Its location in the brain Its size Your age and general health What type of brain tumor do I have? Is it benign or malignant? What is the grade of the tumor? What are my treatment choices? Which do you recommend for me? Why? What are the expected benefits of each kind of treatment? What can I do to prepare for treatment? Will I need to stay in the hospital? If so, for how long? What are the risks and possible side effects of each treatment? How can side effects be managed? What is the treatment likely to cost? Will my insurance cover it? How will treatment affect my normal activities? What is the chance that I will have to learn how to walk, speak, read, or write after treatment? Would a research study (clinical trial) be appropriate for me?"
What is the most common type of surgery to remove brain tumors?,"""Surgery is the usual first treatment for most brain tumors. Before surgery begins, you may be given general anesthesia, and your scalp is shaved. You probably won't need your entire head shaved.""   Surgery to open the skull is called a craniotomy. The surgeon makes an incision in your scalp and uses a special type of saw to remove a piece of bone from the skull. You may be awake when the surgeon removes part or all of the brain tumor. The surgeon removes as much tumor as possible. You may be asked to move a leg, count, say the alphabet, or tell a story. Your ability to follow these commands helps the surgeon protect important parts of the brain. After the tumor is removed, the surgeon covers the opening in the skull with the piece of bone or with a piece of metal or fabric. The surgeon then closes the incision in the scalp. Sometimes surgery isn't possible. If the tumor is in the brain stem or certain other areas, the surgeon may not be able to remove the tumor without harming normal brain tissue. People who can't have surgery may receive radiation therapy or other treatment. You may have a headache or be uncomfortable for the first few days after surgery. However, medicine can usually control pain. Before surgery, you should discuss the plan for pain relief with your health care team. After surgery, your team can adjust the plan if you need more relief. You may also feel tired or weak. The time it takes to heal after surgery is different for everyone. You will probably spend a few days in the hospital. Other, less common problems may occur after surgery for a brain tumor. The brain may swell or fluid may build up within the skull. The health care team will monitor you for signs of swelling or fluid buildup. You may receive steroids to help relieve swelling. A second surgery may be needed to drain the fluid. The surgeon may place a long, thin tube (shunt) in a ventricle of the brain. (For some people, the shunt is placed before performing surgery on the brain tumor.) The tube is threaded under the skin to another part of the body, usually the abdomen. Excess fluid is carried from the brain and drained into the abdomen. Sometimes the fluid is drained into the heart instead. Infection is another problem that may develop after surgery. If this happens, the health care team will give you an antibiotic. Brain surgery may harm normal tissue. Brain damage can be a serious problem. It can cause problems with thinking, seeing, or speaking. It can also cause personality changes or seizures. Most of these problems lessen or disappear with time. But sometimes damage to the brain is permanent. You may need physical therapy, speech therapy, or occupational therapy. See the Rehabilitation section. Do you suggest surgery for me? How will I feel after the operation? What will you do for me if I have pain? How long will I be in the hospital? Will I have any long-term effects? Will my hair grow back? Are there any side effects from using metal or fabric to replace the bone in the skull? When can I get back to my normal activities? What is my chance of a full recovery?"
What is radiation treatment for brain tumors?,"'Radiation therapy kills brain tumor cells with high-energy x-rays, gamma rays, or protons.'""Radiation therapy usually follows surgery. The radiation kills tumor cells that may remain in the area. Sometimes, people who can't have surgery have radiation therapy instead.""'Doctors use external and internal types of radiation therapy to treat brain tumors:''Some people have no or few side effects after treatment. Rarely, people may have nausea for several hours after external radiation therapy. The health care team can suggest ways to help you cope with this problem. Radiation therapy also may cause you to become very tired with each radiation treatment. Resting is important, but doctors usually advise people to try to stay as active as they can.''Also, external radiation therapy commonly causes ''hair loss'' from the part of the head that was treated. Hair usually grows back within a few months. Radiation therapy also may make the skin on the scalp and ears red, dry, and tender. The health care team can suggest ways to relieve these problems.''Sometimes radiation therapy causes brain tissue to swell. You may get a ''headache'' or feel pressure. The health care team watches for signs of this problem. They can provide medicine to reduce the discomfort. Radiation sometimes kills healthy brain tissue. Although rare, this side effect can cause headaches, seizures, or even death.''Radiation may harm the ''pituitary gland'' and other areas of the brain. For children, this damage could cause learning problems or slow down growth and development. In addition, radiation increases the risk of secondary tumors later in life.' External radiation therapy: You'll go to a hospital or clinic for treatment. A large machine outside the body is aimed to direct beams of radiation at either the whole brain or more commonly, at specific portions of the brain. Some people need radiation aimed at the spinal cord also. The treatment schedule depends on your age, and the type and size of the tumor. Fractionated external beam therapy, in which small doses or fractions of radiation are given usually once each day, is the most common method of radiation therapy used for people with brain tumors. Giving the total dose of radiation over several weeks helps to protect healthy tissue in the area of the tumor. Treatments are usually 5 days a week for several weeks. A typical visit lasts less than an hour, and each treatment takes only a few minutes.Some treatment centers are studying other ways of delivering external beam radiation therapy:Intensity-modulated radiation therapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy: These types of treatment use computers to more closely target the brain tumor to lessen the damage to healthy tissue.Proton beam radiation therapy: The source of radiation is protons rather than X-rays. The doctor aims the proton beam at the tumor. The dose of radiation to normal tissue from a proton beam is less than the dose from an X-ray beam.Stereotactic radiation therapy: Narrow beams of X-rays or gamma rays are directed at the tumor from different angles. For this procedure, you wear a rigid head frame. The therapy may be given during a single visit (stereotactic radiosurgery) or over several visits. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy or 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy: These types of treatment use computers to more closely target the brain tumor to lessen the damage to healthy tissue. Proton beam radiation therapy: The source of radiation is protons rather than X-rays. The doctor aims the proton beam at the tumor. The dose of radiation to normal tissue from a proton beam is less than the dose from an X-ray beam. Stereotactic radiation therapy: Narrow beams of X-rays or gamma rays are directed at the tumor from different angles. For this procedure, you wear a rigid head frame. The therapy may be given during a single visit (stereotactic radiosurgery) or over several visits. Internal radiation therapy (implant radiation therapy or brachytherapy): Internal radiation isn't commonly used for treating brain tumors and is under study. The radiation comes from radioactive material usually contained in very small implants called seeds. The seeds are placed inside the brain and give off radiation for months. They don't need to be removed once the radiation is gone. Why do I need this treatment? When will the treatments begin? When will they end? How will I feel during therapy? Are there side effects? What can I do to take care of myself during therapy? How will we know if the radiation is working? Will I be able to continue my normal activities during treatment?"
What is chemotherapy treatment for brain tumors?,"'Chemotherapy, the use of ''drugs'' to kill cancer cells, is sometimes used to treat brain tumors. Drugs may be given in the following ways:' By mouth or vein (intravenous): Chemotherapy may be given during and after radiation therapy. The drugs enter the bloodstream and travel throughout the body. They may be given in an outpatient part of the hospital, at the doctor's office, or at home. Rarely, you may need to stay in the hospital. The side effects of chemotherapy depend mainly on which drugs are given and how much. Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, headache, fever and chills, and weakness. If the drugs lower the levels of healthy blood cells, you're more likely to get infections, bruise or bleed easily, and feel very weak and tired. Your health care team will check for low levels of blood cells. Some side effects may be relieved with medicine. In wafers that are put into the brain: For some adults with high-grade glioma, the surgeon implants several wafers into the brain. Each wafer is about the size of a dime. Over several weeks, the wafers dissolve, releasing the drug into the brain. The drug kills cancer cells. It may help prevent the tumor from returning in the brain after surgery to remove the tumor. People who receive an implant (a wafer) that contains a drug are monitored by the health care team for signs of infection after surgery. An infection can be treated with an antibiotic. What will it do? Will I have side effects? What can I do about them? When will treatment start? When will it end? How will treatment affect my normal activities?"
Is it important to have a nutritious diet plan if you have a brain tumor?,"""It's important for you to take care of yourself by eating well. You need the number of calories to maintain a good weight. You also need enough protein to keep up your strength. Eating well may help you feel better and have more energy.""""Sometimes, especially during or soon after treatment, you may not feel like eating. You may be uncomfortable or tired. You may find that foods don't taste as good as they used to. In addition, the side effects of treatment (such as poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, or mouth ""'blisters'') can make it hard to eat well. Your doctor, a registered dietitian, or another healthcare provider can suggest ways to deal with these problems.' "
What about follow-up care after brain tumor treatment?," You'll need regular checkups after treatment for a brain tumor. For example, for certain types of brain tumors, checkups may be every 3 months. Checkups help ensure that any changes in your health are noted and treated if needed. If you have any health problems between checkups, you should contact your doctor. Your doctor will check for return of the tumor. Also, checkups help detect health problems that can result from cancer treatment. Checkups may include careful physical and neurologic exams, as well as MRI or CT scans. If you have a shunt, your doctor checks to see that it's working well."
Will you need rehabilitation therapy after brain tumor treatment or surgery?,"'Rehabilitation can be a very important part of the treatment plan. The goals of rehabilitation depend on your needs and how the tumor has affected your ability to carry out daily activities.''Some people may never regain all the abilities they had before the brain tumor and its treatment. But your health care team makes every effort to help you return to normal activities as soon as possible.''Several types of therapists can help:''Children with brain tumors may have special needs. Sometimes children have tutors in the hospital or at home. Children who have problems learning or remembering what they learn may need tutors or special classes when they return to school.' Physical therapists: Brain tumors and their treatment may cause  paralysis. They may also cause weakness and problems with balance. Physical therapists help people regain strength and balance. Speech therapists: Speech therapists help people who have trouble speaking, expressing thoughts, or swallowing. Occupational therapists: Occupational therapists help people learn to manage activities of daily living, such as eating, using the toilet, bathing, and dressing. Physical medicine specialists: Medical doctors with special training help people with brain tumors stay as active as possible. They can help people recover lost abilities and return to daily activities."
What supportive care is available for people with a brain tumor and their caregivers?,"'Brain tumor support information for patients and caregivers\xa0''Your healthcare team can help you with the following problems:''Support for brain tumor treatments, and managing its symptoms''For tips on coping, you may want to read the NCI booklet Taking Time: Support for People With Cancer.' Learning you have a brain tumor can change your life and the lives of those close to you. These changes can be hard to handle. It's normal for you, your family, and your friends to need help coping with the feelings that such a diagnosis can bring.  Brain tumors and its treatments can lead to other health problems. It is common to have concerns about brain tumor treatments or surgery, plus; the side effects, hospital stays, and medical bills can be overwhelming to manage. You may also worry about caring for your family, keeping your job, or continuing daily activities.  You may receive supportive care to prevent or control these problems. You can have supportive care before, during, and after cancer treatment. It can improve your comfort and quality of life during treatment.  Brain cancer treatments are intended to slow the progress of cancer. Some people decide not to have antitumor treatment, and receive only supportive care to manage their symptoms. Swelling of the brain: Many people with brain tumors need steroids to help relieve swelling of the brain. Seizures: Brain tumors can cause seizures (convulsions). Certain drugs can help prevent or control seizures. Fluid buildup in the skull: If fluid builds up in the skull, the surgeon may place a shunt to drain the fluid. Information about shunts is in the Surgery part of the Treatment section. Sadness and other feelings: It's normal to feel sad, anxious, or confused after a diagnosis of a serious illness. Some people find it helpful to talk about their feelings. See the Sources of Support section for more information. Doctors, nurses, and other members of your healthcare team can answer questions about brain tumor treatment, working, or other activities. Social workers, counselors, or members of the clergy can be helpful if you want to talk about your feelings or concerns. Often, social workers can suggest resources for financial aid, transportation, home care, or emotional support. Support groups also can help. In these groups, people with brain tumors, family members, or caregivers can meet with other patients or their families to share what they have learned about coping with the disease and the effects of treatment. Groups may offer support in person, over the telephone, or on the Internet. You may want to talk with a member of your health care team about finding a support group. Information specialists at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) and at LiveHelp (http://www.cancer.gov/livehelp) can help you locate programs, services, and publications. They can send you a list of organizations that offer services to people with cancer."
What is biological therapy?,"""Biological or biologic therapy is treatment designed to stimulate or restore the ability of the body's immune (natural internal defense) system to fight infection and disease. Biological therapy is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy and is commonly used to treat different kinds of ""'cancers'', as well as other conditions.' "
How does biological therapy work?,"""Biological therapy is a form of treatment that uses portions of the body's natural immune system to treat a disease. Biological therapy is also used to protect the body from some of the side effects of certain treatments.""'Biological therapy often involves the use of substances called biological response modifiers (BRMs). The body normally produces these substances in small amounts in response to infection and disease. Using modern laboratory techniques, scientists can produce BRMs in large amounts for use in the treatment of ''cancer'' and other diseases, such as ''rheumatoid arthritis'"" and Crohn's disease.""'Biological therapy may also target specific molecules on ''cancer'' cells to destroy the cells, or it may target proteins that facilitate the growth of ''cancer'' cells.''Depending on the agent, biological therapies can be given by mouth, intravenously, or as an injection.'

What are examples of biological therapies?,"'Monoclonal antibodies, ''interferon'', interleukin-2 (IL-2), and several types of colony-stimulating factors (CSF, GM- CSF, G-CSF) are forms of biological therapy. For example, interleukin-2 and interferon are two examples of BRMs being tested for the treatment of advanced ''malignant melanoma''.''Monoclonal antibodies are a common type of biological therapy for many different cancers and other conditions. These are laboratory-produced antibodies that are designed to attack specific proteins expressed by abnormal cells. Examples of monoclonal antibody ''drugs'' include ''rituximab'"", which is used to treat non-Hodgkin's ""'lymphoma'', alemtuzumab (''Campath'') to treat ''chronic lymphocytic leukemia'' (CLL), and ipilimumab (Yervoy) for metastatic ''melanoma''.''Other kinds of monoclonal antibodies used to treat cancers target proteins that are responsible for cell growth. Examples of these drugs include bevacizumab (''Avastin''), which targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix) to target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and ''trastuzumab'' (''Herceptin'') and pertuzumab (Perjeta) to target the human epidermal growth factor receptor- 2 (HER-2).''Modes of biologic therapy that involve blocking the action of specific proteins of inflammation, called ''tumor'' necrosis factor (TNF), are being used for the treatment of a number of diseases, including ''rheumatoid arthritis'"" and Crohn's disease. ""'Etanercept'' (''Enbrel'') and ''infliximab'' (''Remicade'') are examples of commercially available injectable TNF-blocking treatments for patients with severe ''rheumatoid arthritis''.''Biological therapy is a very active and exciting area of cancer research.' "
What type of specialists administer biological therapy?,"'Biological therapies are prescribed by specialists who treat cancers (oncologists or hematologist-oncologists), as well as other specialists, including ''rheumatologists'' and gastroenterologists.' "
What are the side effects of biological therapy?,"'The side effects of biological therapy depend on the type of treatment. Side effects include ''flu-like symptoms'' such as ''chills'', ''fever'', muscle aches, ''weakness'', ''loss of appetite'', ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''. Some patients develop a ''rash'', and some bleed or bruise easily. In addition, interleukin therapy can cause swelling.''Depending on how severe these problems are, hospitalization during treatment may be required for some patients. Side effects are usually short-term and gradually subside after treatment ends.''The long-term side effects of the various currently available biological therapies will be better defined with future research from which will also surely emerge new and valuable forms of these treatments.'  "
What are the testicles? What do they look like (pictures)?,"'The testicles form part of the male reproductive organs, with a primary function of producing sperm and the male hormone testosterone.' Testicles are contained within an external sac-like structure called the scrotum, which is located between the penis and the anus. Adult testicles are about the size two large olives. It is common for one testicle to hang lower than the other within the scrotum. Located near the back of each testicle lies the epididymis, which is a coiled tubular structure that functions to store and transport sperm. A tubular structure containing blood vessels, nerves, lymphatic vessels and the vas deferens called the spermatic cord courses from the abdomen and is connected to each testicle. Apart from containing vital structures for each testicle, the spermatic cord also suspends the testicles within the scrotum."
What does testicular pain feel like? How severe is the pain?,"'Testicular pain is pain or discomfort that is felt in one or both testicles. The pain may originate from the testicle itself, or it may be the result of other conditions affecting the scrotum, groin, or abdomen. Though there are numerous medical conditions that can cause testicular pain, it is important to understand that a few of them constitute medical emergencies that require immediate medical attention in order to prevent impairment or loss of testicular function. Testicular pain can be an acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) condition. The testicular pain may be constant or intermittent.' "
What causes testicular pain? What are other symptoms of pain in the testicles?,"'Many diseases and other health problems can cause pain in one or both testicles. Testicular pain along with other symptoms and signs vary depending on the underlying cause. However, often times the symptoms can be very similar between the various causes, making it difficult to distinguish among the conditions which require urgent medical attention. ''Therefore, if you experience testicular pain, call your doctor immediately or go to the nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department. '  "
"Testicular torsion causes, symptoms, and signs","'Testicular torsion typically occurs because of an anomaly affecting the normal attachment of the testicle within the scrotum, often referred to as the ""bell clapper"" deformity. This abnormality allows the testicle to be freely suspended and twist spontaneously. Often times, this anomaly is present in both testicles. Trauma to the testicle is a rare cause of testicular torsion.''Testicular torsion is most common in males younger than 30 years of age, with a peak incidence between 12 to 18 years of age. It can also occur more frequently during the ''neonatal'' period. Testicular torsion most often affects the left testicle, and it is the most common cause of testicle loss in adolescent males.''Testicular torsion generally comes on suddenly. Severe testicle pain that is only felt in one testicle may also have these signs and symptoms:' Nausea and vomiting Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness Testicular and/or scrotal swelling and redness Abdominal pain Fever Elevation of the affected testicle within the scrotum Horizontal positioning of the affected testicle within the scrotum Loss of the cremasteric reflex on the affected side (normally, the testicle elevates with light stroking of the upper inner thigh area)."
"Epididymitis causes, symptoms, and signs","'Epididymitis occurs when there is inflammation of the epididymis (a structure within the scrotum). Generally, the condition is result of an infection. Epididymitis primarily affects adult men, and is most common between the ages of 19 to 40 years; however, it can occur in prepubescent boys and elderly men.''Sexually transmitted diseases or ''STDs'' that are most commonly caused by the bacteria ''Chlamydia trachomatis'' and ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' are the most common cause of epididymitis in sexually active men. In younger and older males, the infection usually is caused by bacteria such as ''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli'') that are found in the urinary tract. Infection in these age groups is typically the result of an abnormality within the genitourinary system.''Epididymitis comes on gradually. The testicular pain can be mild, moderate, or severe, and only in one testicle. Epididymitis also may have symptoms and signs including:' Nausea and vomiting Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, typically localized to the area of the epididymis, though it can become more generalized and involve the whole testicle as the illness progresses Testicular and/or scrotal swelling and redness Abdominal pain Fever Urethral discharge Urinary symptoms, such as burning, urgency, or frequency"
"Inguinal hernia causes, symptoms, and signs","'An ''inguinal hernia'' is a bulge or protrusion of intestine through a defect in the abdominal wall musculature of the groin area. This protrusion can sometimes cause ''swelling of the scrotum'' and subsequent testicular pain.''Inguinal hernias are common and they can sometimes cause discomfort in the scrotum and/or testicles. Signs and symptoms of an inguinal ''hernia'' may include a:' Bulge in the scrotum or in the inguinal area, that may become more pronounced with coughing or straining; and Dull ache or burning sensation in the scrotum and/or testicles."
"Testicular tumor causes, symptoms, and signs","""Generally, testicular tumors don't cause pain; however, occasionally some tumors can cause pain and discomfort of the testicle or scrotum. Signs and symptoms of a tumor in a testicle may include a:"" Lump or mass of the testicle Change in the size or texture of the testicle Dull ache of the lower abdomen, lower back or groin area Feeling of heaviness in the scrotum"
"Orchitis causes, symptoms, and signs","'Orchitis is a sign of inflammation of a testicle, usually because of an infection, for example, the mumps, the most common cause of the condition. Usually, mumps orchitis occurs in males who have not reached ''puberty''; however, there has been an increase in cases in boys who have gone through puberty and adolescent males, secondary to the decreased use of the mumps ''vaccine''. Rarely, orchitis can be caused by a bacterial infection that, usually, is the result of progression of epididymitis (epididymo-orchitis).''Because orchitis generally occurs as a consequence of an infection (most often mumps), it is typically also accompanied by other systemic infectious symptoms. Testicular pain may range from mild to severe. Signs and symptoms of orchitis may include:' Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, swelling or redness Fever and chills Headache Body aches Nausea Fatigue Parotid gland inflammation (parotitis) in cases of mumps"
"Trauma and injury causes, symptoms, and signs","'Trauma or injury of any type to the testicles can cause severe pain and discomfort. Blunt testicular trauma (around 85%) is the most common cause of testicle pain. Examples of causes of injuries to the testicle include sports injuries, a direct kick to the groin or testicle, car accidents, and straddle injuries. Usually, the pain improves with time. Rarely, trauma to the testicles can cause more severe injuries requiring immediate medical attention.''The testicular pain may range from severe to absent at the time the person sees a doctor. Rarely however, the injury may seem minor, but there may be a serious underlying injury to the testicle.''Other symptoms and signs of trauma or injury to a testicle include:' Testicular and/or scrotal tenderness, swelling or bruising Bruising of the area between the scrotum and the anus (perineum) Nausea and vomiting"
"Testicle rupture causes, symptoms, and signs","'Testicle rupture is a serious injury that is a result of a disruption to the connective tissue enveloping the testicle (tunica albuginea), which then causes extrusion of testicular tissue. Often, a sign of testicular rupture is a blood collection (hematocele) that surrounds the testicle.''Other types of injuries that cause testicular rupture include penetrating trauma and testicular dislocation. These types of testicular injuries typically require surgery.' "
"Torsion of a testicular appendage cause, symptoms, and signs","'Torsion of a testicular appendage occurs due to twisting (torsion) of the testicular or epididymal appendage, which are functionless structures that are remnants of tissue from human development. The testicular appendage lies between the testicle and the epididymis, while the epididymal appendage typically projects from the epididymis. As with testicular torsion, twisting of these structures leads to a decrease in blood flow and subsequent testicular pain. This is a common condition in younger boys, with most cases occurring between 7 to 14 years of age. Though this condition is benign and self-limiting, it must be distinguished from the more serious testicular torsion.''With torsion of a testicular appendage, the onset of testicle pain may be sudden or gradual, and the severity of pain may range from mild to severe. Generally, a person has no symptoms or signs like nausea, vomiting, and fever.''The testicle and/or scrotum generally appear normal, without swelling and redness; however, other symptoms and signs may include:''Preservation of the normal vertical positioning of the affected testicle within the scrotum, and preservation of the cremasteric reflex is generally maintained.' Testicular tenderness, typically only localized to the top of the right or left testicle. Sometimes, a small blue-dot is visualized near the top of the affected testicle (blue-dot sign)."
Can kidney stones cause testicular pain and other symptoms and signs?,"'Occasionally, the pain associated with kidney stones can radiate into the groin area and cause testicular pain. However, the testicles appear normal with no swelling or redness. Other signs and symptoms of kidney stones may include:' Back (flank) pain and tenderness Abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Urinary symptoms, such as blood in the urine, discomfort with urination and urinary frequency"
How are the causes of testicular pain diagnosed?,"""In order to diagnose the underlying condition causing testicular pain, a health care professional will perform a complete history and physical exam. Laboratory testing and imaging studies may also be ordered depending on the health care professional's initial impression and evaluation.""'Laboratory testing may include:''Imaging studies may be ordered by your health care professional to further delineate the underlying cause of the testicular pain. In certain patients with testicular pain whose symptoms are strongly suggestive of testicular torsion, immediate urologic consultation prior to testing should be obtained in order to prevent potential delays in definitive surgical management.''A color Doppler testicular ''ultrasound'' is a noninvasive imaging study that can evaluate the blood flow to the testicles, as well as the presence of testicular tumors, fluid collections, testicular rupture, and hernias. A kidney ultrasound can be helpful in the evaluation of kidney stones.''This is an imaging study requiring the intravenous administration of a radionuclide, useful for the evaluation of testicular torsion, as well as other causes of testicular pain. It is used much less commonly than ultrasound.''CT scan'' or a kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) X-ray ''These particular imaging studies are sometimes ordered if there is a suspicion that the testicular pain is being caused by kidney stones or other conditions in the abdomen or pelvis.' Blood work Urinalysis A swab of the urethra (if the patient has penile discharge suggestive of a sexually transmitted disease)"
What is the treatment for testicular pain?,"'The treatment for testicular pain varies depending on the underlying cause. As already noted, some conditions causing testicular pain are medical emergencies requiring immediate surgical intervention.''The treatment of uncomplicated epididymitis can generally be managed as an outpatient, and consists of the following treatment measures:''In general, acute epididymitis that is properly treated resolves without complications. However, in some cases of epididymitis, such as those associated with serious systemic symptoms or in those accompanied by various complications, hospitalization may be necessary. A urologist will be consulted in these more serious cases.''The treatment for torsion of the testicular or epididymal appendage is directed toward relief of symptoms, and consists of the following measures:''Most patients improve with these treatment measures within 1 week, though symptoms may last longer. In cases of testicular pain refractory to conservative management, surgical excision of the affected tissue is considered.''The treatment for kidney stones generally depends on the location of the ''kidney stone'', the size of the ''kidney stone'', and any associated complications, such as infection. An uncomplicated kidney stone can typically be treated with the following measures:''Several different measures exist for treating kidney stones that do not pass spontaneously, such as ''lithotripsy'' (the use of ''shock'' waves to break up the kidney stone) and other more invasive surgical procedures.''Certain patients with intractable pain, intractable vomiting or those with signs of infection require hospitalization. In those with ''urinary tract infection'' and an obstruction in the genitourinary system, antibiotics and emergent urologic intervention are necessary.''The treatment and management of testicular trauma depends on the severity of injury. Minor cases of testicular trauma without suspected serious underlying testicular injury can be managed as an outpatient with the following measures:''With testicular rupture, immediate surgical repair is necessary to preserve testicular function and viability. Other situations requiring surgical management include certain blunt trauma injuries with associated blood collections (hematoceles), penetrating trauma, and certain cases of testicular dislocation.''The treatment of orchitis depends on the infectious organism responsible for causing the testicular inflammation. Both viral and bacterial orchitis can be treated with the following measures:''Bacterial orchitis and epididymo-orchitis require antibiotics. Those cases caused by ''viruses'' do not require antibiotics.'   Definitive management of testicular torsion requires surgery by a urologist. During surgery, the affected testicle is untwisted, and if it is viable, the testicle is secured to the scrotal wall (orchiopexy). The unaffected testicle may also be secured to prevent testicular torsion from occurring, as some males will have the bell clapper abnormality on both sides. Sometimes, the affected testicle can be manually untwisted by a doctor without necessitating emergent surgery, though this is a temporizing measure that ultimately still requires definitive surgical repair. Likewise, some cases of testicular torsion can occur and then resolve spontaneously, and the health care professional must maintain a high index of suspicion in order for this condition to be diagnosed and ultimately surgically repaired. The more rapidly the testicle is untwisted and blood flow is restored, the better the chances for salvaging the affected testicle. If treated within 6 hours of symptom onset, the salvage rate nears 100%, while after 24 hours the salvage rate is between 0% and 10%. Antibiotics (which may vary depending on the patient's age and sexual history), pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs Adequate fluid intake Pain medication Anti- nausea medication In some instances medications such as tamsulosin (Flomax), which may facilitate the passage of kidney stones The treatment for a testicular tumor depends on various factors. A testicular mass is considered cancer until proven otherwise. If testicular cancer is diagnosed, patients are referred to an oncologist who will discuss the different treatment options available. Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs The definitive treatment of inguinal hernias requires surgical repair, sometimes electively as an outpatient, while others require intervention on a more emergent basis. Occasionally, inguinal hernias may not be repaired even electively because a patient is too high-risk to undergo surgery. Prompt surgical intervention is necessary in cases of inguinal hernias that are not reducible (unable to be pushed back into the abdomen) and in those cases of strangulation (disruption to the blood supply of the intestine). Pain medication and anti-inflammatory agents Rest Scrotal support and elevation Ice packs"
What are the complications of causes of testicular pain?,"'The complications associated with the different causes of testicular pain are varied. Some individuals may suffer from chronic testicular pain, even after the acute cause of the testicular pain has been treated. Other potential complications may include:'   Permanent damage to the testicle Loss of testicle Infertility Infection Cosmetic deformity Epididymitis complications Epididymo-orchitis Abscess (a collection of pus) formation Impaired fertility Systemic blood infection (sepsis) There are no significant complications for torsion of a testicular appendage. Permanent damage to the testicle Atrophy (decrease in size) of the testicle Loss of testicle Infertility Abscess formation Cosmetic deformity Testicular torsion Incarceration (hernia unable to be pushed back in) Strangulation (disruption to the blood supply of the intestine protruding through the abdominal wall defect) Atrophy of the testicle Impaired fertility Abscess formation Permanent kidney damage Urosepsis (systemic blood infection arising from infected urine) The complications of a testicular tumor vary depending on the underlying type of tumor and the extent of disease."
How can testicular pain be prevented?,"'There are a few measures that you can take to prevent certain causes of testicular pain. However, many of the causes are not entirely preventable.' For epididymitis or bacterial orchitis caused by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), condom use can reduce the risk of transmission of STDs. The use of appropriate protective gear during sporting activities can help prevent testicular trauma. Mumps immunization can decrease the incidence of viral orchitis."
What are uterine fibroids? What do they look like?,"'Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that originate in the uterus (womb). Although they are composed of the same smooth muscle fibers as the uterine wall (myometrium), they are much denser than normal myometrium. Uterine fibroids are usually round. In most cases, fibroids do not cause ''pain'' or other symptoms. However, exceptionally large fibroids may cause pressure on the bladder or other organs, leading to specific symptoms (see: What are the symptoms of uterine fibroids?)''Uterine fibroids are often described based upon their location within the uterus.'   Subserosal fibroids are located beneath the serosa (the lining membrane on the outside of the uterus). These often appear localized on the outside surface of the uterus or may be attached to the outside surface by a pedicle. Submucosal (submucous) fibroids are located inside the uterine cavity beneath the inner lining of the uterus. Intramural fibroids are located within the muscular wall of the uterus. Pedunculated fibroids grow on a stalk of tissue known as a pedicle (like a mushroom), extending either inside the cavity of the uterus or outside the uterus from its outer surface."
What are the symptoms of uterine fibroids? Do they cause pain?,"'Most of the time, uterine fibroids do not cause symptoms or problems, and a woman with a ''fibroid'' is usually unaware of its presence.''However, abnormal uterine bleeding is the most common symptom of a ''fibroid''. If the tumors are near the uterine lining, or interfere with the blood flow to the lining, they can cause heavy periods, painful periods, prolonged periods, or ''spotting'' between menses. Women with excessive bleeding due to fibroids may develop ''iron deficiency anemia''. Uterine fibroids that are degenerating can sometimes cause severe, localized pain.''Fibroids can also cause a number of symptoms depending on their size, location within the uterus, and how close they are to adjacent pelvic organs. Large fibroids can cause:''While fibroids do not interfere with ''ovulation'', some studies suggest that they may impair ''fertility'' and lead to poorer ''pregnancy'' outcomes. In particular, submucosal fibroids that deform the inner uterine cavity are most strongly associated with decreases in fertility. Occasionally, fibroids are the cause of recurrent miscarriages. If they are not removed in these cases, the woman may not be able to sustain a pregnancy.'   pressure, pelvic pain, including pain during sex, pressure on the bladder with frequent or even obstructed urination, and pressure on the rectum with painful or difficult defecation."
What causes uterine fibroids to grow? How big can they get?,"'We do not know exactly why women develop these tumors. Genetic abnormalities, alterations in growth factor (proteins formed in the body that direct the rate and extent of cell proliferation) expression, abnormalities in the vascular (blood vessel) system, and tissue response to injury have all been suggested to play a role in the development of fibroids.''Family history is a key factor, since there is often a history of fibroids developing in women of the same family. Race also appears to play a role. Women of African descent are two to three times more likely to develop fibroids than women of other races. Women of African ancestry also develop fibroids at a younger age and may have symptoms from fibroids in their 20s, in contrast to Caucasian women with fibroids, in whom symptoms typically occur during the 30s and 40s. Early pregnancy decreases the likelihood that fibroids will develop. Fibroids have not been observed in girls who have not reached ''puberty'', but adolescent girls may rarely develop fibroids. Other factors that researchers have associated with an increased risk of developing fibroids include having the first ''menstrual period'' (menarche) prior to age 10, consumption of ''alcohol'' (particularly beer), uterine infections, and elevated ''blood pressure'' (''hypertension'').''Estrogen tends to stimulate the growth of fibroids in many cases. During the ''first trimester'' of pregnancy, about a third of fibroids will enlarge and then shrink after the birth. In general, fibroids tend to shrink after ''menopause'', but ''postmenopausal'' ''hormone therapy'' may cause symptoms to persist.''Overall, these tumors are fairly common and occur in about 70% to 80% of all women by the time they reach age 50.''Uterine fibroids can be as small as a few millimeters (less than an inch) in diameter. They can also be very large (grapefruit-sized or larger).' "
Can uterine fibroids cause cancer?,"'For the most part, uterine fibroids that do not cause a problem for the woman can be left untreated. In some cases, even fibroids that are not causing symptoms require removal or at least close observation. Rapid growth is a reason to watch more carefully, since a rare cancerous form of fibroid (referred to as a leiomyosarcoma) can be a fast-growing ''tumor'', and it cannot be differentiated from a benign fibroid by ultrasound, MRI , or other imaging studies. However, this type of tumor occurs in less than 1% of uterine fibroids. It is also important to note that these rare cancerous tumors are not thought to begin in a benign fibroid.''Another risk of leaving these tumors alone is that they sometimes grow to a size that eventually causes significant symptoms, thus requiring removal. If fibroids grow large enough, the surgery to remove them can become more difficult and risky.' "
What tests diagnose uterine fibroids?,"'Uterine fibroids are diagnosed by pelvic exam and even more commonly by ultrasound. Often, a pelvic mass cannot be determined to be a fibroid on pelvic exam alone, and ultrasound is very helpful in differentiating it from other conditions such as ovarian tumors. MRI and ''CT scans'' can also play a role in diagnosing fibroids, but ultrasound is the simplest, cheapest, and best technique for imaging the pelvis. Occasionally, when trying to determine if a fibroid is present in the uterine cavity (endometrial cavity), a hysterosonogram (HSG) is done. In this procedure, an ultrasound exam is done while contrast fluid is injected into the uterus through the cervix. The fluid within the endometrial cavity can help outline any masses that are inside, such as submucosal fibroids.'  "
Are there home remedies for uterine fibroids?,"'There are no known home remedies that can shrink fibroids. If uterine fibroids are not causing symptoms or problems, they can be left alone without specific treatment. If they are large enough to cause symptoms like bleeding, pain, or pressure, medical or surgical treatment is required.' "
What is the treatment for uterine fibroids?,"'There are several uterine fibroids treatment options, including:''Medical treatments include medications such as:'   surgery (hysterectomy, myomectomy, cryosurgery), MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), and uterine artery embolization (UAE). mifepristone (RU-486), danazol (Danocrine), raloxifene (Evista), GnRH analogs (Lupron and others), and low-dose formulations of oral contraceptives."
Surgery for fibroids,"'There are many ways of managing uterine fibroids. Surgical methods are the mainstay of treatment when treatment is necessary. Possible surgical interventions include hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus (and the fibroids with it). ''Myomectomy'' is the selective removal of just the fibroids within the uterus. Myomectomy can be done through a hysteroscope, laparoscope, or with the standard open incision on the abdominal wall. Some treatments have involved boring holes into the fibroid with laser fibers, freezing probes (cryosurgery), and other destructive techniques that do not actually remove the tissue but try to destroy it in place. Surgery is necessary if there is suspicion of ''malignancy'' in any case of a leiomyoma or uterine mass.''Another technique for treating fibroids is known as uterine artery embolization (UAE). This technique uses small beads of a compound called polyvinyl alcohol, which are injected through a catheter into the arteries that feed the fibroid. These beads obstruct the blood supply to the fibroid and starve it of blood and oxygen. While this technique has not been in use long enough to evaluate long-term effects of UAE versus surgery, women undergoing UAE for fibroids have a shorter hospital stay than those having surgery but a greater risk of complications and readmissions to the hospital. Studies are underway to evaluate the long-term outcomes of UAE as opposed to surgical treatment. Uterine artery occlusion (UAO), which involves clamping the involved uterine arteries as opposed to injecting the polyvinyl alcohol beads, is currently under investigation as a potential alternative to UAE.''High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a relatively new treatment for fibroids and other abnormalities. It is also known as MRgFUS (MRI-guided focused ultrasound) and FUS (focused ultrasound surgery). HIFU uses an ultrasound transducer with higher energy than those used for diagnostic examinations. The device focuses the sound waves, generating heat to destroy the fibroid. MRI imaging may be used for planning and monitoring of treatment.'  "
Medical treatment for fibroids,"'Nonsurgical techniques are usually hormonal in nature and include the use of ''drugs'' that turn off the production of estrogen from the ovaries (GnRH analogs). These medications are given for three to six months and induce a hypoestrogenic (low estrogen) state. When successful, they can shrink the fibroids by as much as 50%. Side effects of these drugs are similar to the ''symptoms of menopause'' and can include ''hot flashes'', ''sleep'' disturbance, ''vaginal dryness'', and ''mood changes''. Bone loss leading to ''osteoporosis'' after long-term (6 to 12+ months) use is one complication. This is generally reversed after the treatment ends. These drugs may also be used as preoperative treatment for large leiomyomas to shrink them in order to make the operation less difficult and reduce surgical risk.''Mifepristone (RU-486) is an antiprogestin drug that can shrink fibroids to an extent comparable to treatment with the GnRH analogs. This drug is also used to terminate early pregnancy. Treatment with mifepristone also reduces the bleeding associated with fibroids, but this treatment can be associated with adverse side effects such as overgrowth (hyperplasia) of the ''endometrium'' (uterine lining). Mifepristone is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of uterine leiomyomas, and the required dosages (different from those used for termination of early pregnancy) have not been determined.''Danazol (Danocrine) is an androgenic steroid hormone that has been used to reduce bleeding in women with fibroids, since this drug causes ''menstruation'' to cease. However, danazol does not appear to shrink the size of fibroids. Danazol is also associated with significant side effects, including ''weight gain'', ''muscle cramps'', decreased breast size, ''acne'', hirsutism (inappropriate hair growth), oily skin, mood changes, ''depression'', decreased high density lipoprotein (''HDL'' or ""good"" ''cholesterol'') levels, and increased ''liver'' enzyme levels.''The administration of raloxifene (Evista), a drug used to prevent and treat ''osteoporosis'' in postmenopausal women, has been shown to decrease the size of fibroids in postmenopausal women, but results with this therapy in premenopausal women have been conflicting.''Low dose formulations of oral contraceptives are also sometimes given to treat the abnormal bleeding associated with fibroids, but these do not shrink the fibroids themselves.' "
What are the risks of uterine fibroids during pregnancy?,"'Some studies have shown an increased risk of pregnancy complications in the presence of fibroids, such as first trimester bleeding, breech presentation, ''placental abruption'', and problems during ''labor''. Fibroids have also been associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery. The size of the fibroid and its precise location within the uterus are important factors in determining whether a fibroid causes obstetric complications.' "
What is deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy/turbinoplasty?,'Nasal obstruction is often caused by a deviated or crooked septum or enlarged tissues (inferior turbinates or inferior nasal conchae) within the nose. A septoplasty is an operation to correct a deformity of the partition (the septum) between the two sides of the nose. A turbinectomy is the surgical reduction or actual removal of an abnormally enlarged turbinate from inside the nose to improve ''breathing''.''The goals of nasal airway surgery include the following:' Improve airflow through the nose Control nosebleeds Enhance visualization of the inside of the nose (to identify other nasal problems) Relieve nasal or sinus headaches associated with swelling of the inside of the nose Promote drainage of the sinus cavities
What are risks and complications of deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy?,"'Although the surgery will be performed safely and with care in order to obtain the best possible results, patients have the right to be informed that the surgery may involve risks of unsuccessful results, complications, or injury from both known and unforeseen causes. Because individuals differ in their response to surgery, anesthetic reactions, and healing outcomes, ultimately, there can be no guarantee made as to the results or potential complications. Furthermore, surgical outcomes may be dependent on preexisting or concurrent medical conditions. Additional surgery may be necessary after the nose has had a chance to heal after surgery. Moreover, adherence to follow-up instructions and appointments by the patient can influence the surgical results.''The following complications have been reported in the medical literature. This list is not meant to be inclusive of every possible complication. They are listed here for information only, not to frighten patients, but to make them aware and more knowledgeable concerning these surgical procedures. Although many of these complications are rare, they can occur even in the hands of experienced surgeons practicing the standard of care for the procedure. Anyone who is contemplating surgery must weigh the potential risks and complications against the potential benefits of the surgery, or any alternative to surgery. The following is a list of complications that may occur with these nasal surgeries:' Nasal obstruction due to failure to straighten the septum or later re-deviation of the septum, or the re-growth or swelling of the turbinates. This may necessitate revision surgery. Failure to resolve coexisting sinus infections or recurrence of coexisting sinus problems and/or polyps, or need for further or more aggressive surgery. Bleeding. In rare situations, a need for blood products or a blood transfusion. Chronic nasal drainage, or excessive dryness or crusting of the nose or sinuses Need for allergy evaluation, treatments, or environmental controls. Surgery is neither a cure for nor a substitute for good allergy control or treatment. Failure to improve or resolve concurrent respiratory illnesses such as, but not limited to asthma, bronchitis, or cough. Failure to resolve associated ""sinus or nasal"" headaches. The exact cause of headaches can be difficult to determine and have many causes that are not due to nasal septum or turbinates. Patients may require consultation with another specialist such as a neurologist. Damage to the eye and its associated structures. Brain fluid (CSF) leak or infection. Permanent numbness of the upper teeth, palate, or face. Prolonged pain, impaired healing, and the need for hospitalization. Septal perforation, which is a hole inside the nose (septum) that produces an open connection between the right and left sides of the nose. Failure to restore or worsening of the sense of smell or taste, or failure to relieve nosebleeds."
What happens before deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy?,"'In most situations, the surgery is performed as an outpatient at either a hospital or surgicenter. In both facilities, quality health care is provided. An anesthesiologist will monitor the sedated patient throughout the procedures. If the doctor has ordered preoperative laboratory studies, patients should arrange to have these done several days in advance. Patients should bring a copy of these results with them the day of surgery for the anesthesiologist and surgeon to review. Patients need to arrange for someone to transport them home from the surgical facility, and to spend the first night after surgery with the patient, as previously mentioned.'""After surgery, the doctor may ask patients to start using salt water (saline) irrigation's. The doctor will instruct the patient on how, what, and when to start and using irrigation.""'Patients should not take ''aspirin'', or any product containing aspirin, within 10 days prior to the surgery date. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (such as ''ibuprofen'' or ''naproxen'') should not be taken within 7 days prior to the surgery date. If you are on any blood thinners, sucha as Courmadin or ''Eliquis'', tell your doctor, and follow any instructions. Many ''over-the-counter products'' contain aspirin or ibuprofen type ''drugs'"" so it is important to check all medications carefully. If there is any question individuals should call the health care professional's office or consult a Pharmacist. ""'Acetaminophen'' (''Tylenol'') is an acceptable ''pain reliever''. Usually the doctor will give necessary prescription medications at the preoperative visit. It is best to have these filled prior to the date of surgery.'""Patients will receive instructions about eating and drinking limitations prior to surgery. These instructions also will include water, candy, or chewing gum. Anything in the stomach increases the chances of an anesthetic complication. Patient's who smoke should make every effort to stop ""'smoking'', or at least reduce the number of cigarettes. This will help to reduce postoperative ''coughing'' and bleeding. Patients should discuss this precaution specifically with their surgeon and specifically inform the anesthesiologist about their ''smoking'"" history so that the doctors clearly understand the patient's preoperative condition.""'If patients are sick or have a ''fever'"" the day before surgery, they should call the doctor's office. If they wake up sick the day of surgery, they could still proceed to the surgical facility as planned for an evaluation. The doctor will decide if it's safe to proceed with surgery."" "
What happens the day of deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy?,"'It is important for patients to know precisely what time to check in with the surgical facility, and to allow sufficient preparation time. Patients should bring all papers and forms with them including any pre-operative orders and history sheets. They should wear comfortable loose fitting clothes which do not have to be pulled over the head. All jewelry and valuables should be left at home. All make-up should be removed with a cleansing cream. Patients should thoroughly wash their face with soap and water. They should not apply make-up, lotion, or cream to the face.''Patients should not take any medication unless instructed by the doctor or anesthesiologist. Usually in the pre-operative holding room, a nurse will start an intravenous infusion line (IV) and patients may be given a sedative medication to help them relax.' "
"What happens during deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or 
turbinectomy?","'In the operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of a ''gas'' and an intravenous medication to put the patient to ''sleep'' and to maintain anesthetic sedation at a safe and comfortable level. During the procedure, the patient will be continuously monitored with devices including a pulse oximeter (oxygen saturation) and a cardiac rhythm monitor (''EKG'""). The surgical team is prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room. The entire procedure takes approximately one hour, however this can vary greatly depending on the patient's anatomical considerations for the surgeon. The doctor will come to the waiting room to talk with any family or friends once the patient is safely transported to the recovery room."" "
What happens after deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy?,"'After surgery, the patient will be taken to the recovery room where a nurse will monitor the patient. They will be able to go home the same day as the surgery once fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes several hours. The patient will need a friend or family member to pick them up from the surgical facility and take them home. It may be necessary for the family member or friend to spend the first night with the patient after surgery for assistance.''When patients arrive home from the surgical facility, they should go to bed and rest with their head elevated on two to three pillows. By keeping the head elevated above the ''heart'' they can minimize fluid accumulation in the tissues (''edema'') and swelling. They may get out of bed with assistance to use the bathroom. Patients should avoid straining while urinating or passing ''stool''. If constipated they should take a ''stool softener'' or a gentle ''laxative''.''Patients may have some swelling of the nose, upper lip, cheeks, or around the eyes for several days after surgery. This swelling will gradually resolve and is normal. They can help reduce the swelling by putting ice on the face, ''bridge'' of the nose, and eyes as much as tolerated. This will also help with postoperative edema and pain. Some patients have found frozen vegetable in packages (for example ''bags'' of frozen peas) to be a convenient ice pack which is more likely to conform to the face.''Moderate bleeding from the nose is normal, and will gradually decrease. The gauze dressing (""mustache dressing"") will collect blood and should be changed only when saturated. It is not unusual to change these dressings every hour during the first 24 hours after surgery. After a few days, patients will usually no longer need to use the dressing. Patients should not take aspirin, aspirin-containing medications, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (''NSAIDs'') such as ibuprofen or naproxen for three weeks following surgery.''It is best for patients to eat a light, soft, and cool ''diet'' as tolerated once recovered fully from the anesthetic. Hot liquids should be avoided for several days. Even though the individual may be hungry immediately after surgery, it is best to proceed slowly with food intake to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Occasionally, the person may vomit one or two times immediately after surgery; if ''vomiting'' persists, the doctor can prescribe medication to settle the stomach. It is important to remember that a good overall ''diet'' with ample rest promotes healing.''Patients will be prescribed antibiotics after surgery, and should finish all the pills that have been prescribed. Some form of a narcotic may also be prescribed and is to be taken as needed. If patients require narcotics, they are cautioned not to drive. In some situations, the doctor may prescribe steroids to reduce inflammation either preoperatively and/or postoperatively. It is very important that patients take this medication as prescribed, and not discontinue it prematurely. If patients have ''nausea'' or vomiting postoperatively, they may be prescribed ''anti-nausea'' medications (''antiemetics''). If patients have any questions or they feel they are developing a reaction to any of these medications, they should consult their doctor. Patients should not take any other medication, either prescribed or ''over-the-counter'', unless they have discussed the medications with the doctor.' "
General instructions and follow-up care for deviated septum surgery (septoplasty) or turbinectomy,"'In most situations, packs will have been placed in the nose to control bleeding; often times a septal splint is placed that will be removed by the surgeon at the first post-operative visit. The doctor will let the patient know when they are to return to the office to have these packs removed. Patients may need to call the office to schedule this postoperative appointment and should arrange for someone to drive them to and from the office for this first visit. They should eat a light meal before going, and avoid taking excessive pain medications. They may also have several subsequent office visits to assess healing, remove crusts (debris) that may accumulate at the surgical site, especially if combined with ''sinus surgery''. Such visits help insure a speedy recovery. The nose will probably be tender after surgery, so the doctor will spray it with a special numbing medication before removing crusts.'""After the packing has been removed, patients may breathe through the nose, but are not to blow or sneeze through the nose for 7 to 10 days. If the person must sneeze, they should open their mouth. Patients can expect some light blood-tinged drainage from the nose for several days. If bleeding becomes excessive, apply ice and rest quietly with head elevated while holding the nose. If bleeding continues, they should call the surgeon's office for advice.""'One of the most important things patients can do after surgery is nasal irrigation (rinsing). Immediately after the nasal packs are removed they should use a saline nasal spray such as ""Ocean Spray"" several times per day to prevent crusts from forming in their nose. Patients are to continue using irrigation until the doctor tells them to stop. Many patients will use irrigations (for example, neti-pots) indefinitely or when they have an ''upper respiratory infection''. Failure to irrigate especially as instructed after surgery will likely cause the surgery to fail.''Patients may go back to work or school only when the doctor indicates it is safe to return. They should rest for the first week following surgery. They must also avoid excessive talking, smiling, chewing hard foods, strenuous activities, bumping their nose, bending over, and lifting heavy objects. They should not rest glasses on the bridge of the nose until soreness and swelling subsides. They may wear ''contact lenses'' once eye swelling and any irritation has resolved. ''Alcohol'' and tobacco products should be avoided because they may prolong swelling and healing. Smoke, dust, and fumes may irritate the nose and cause an infection. Facial tanning is discouraged for six months after surgery. If patients must be in the sun they should use a number 15 or greater sun block. Patients may use their usual make-up any time after surgery.''Patients should lubricate the nostrils, as instructed with a Q-tip and Vaseline to soften crusts that are hard and firmly attached to healing tissue. Peroxide helps to loosen crusts. After several days they may notice a few of the absorbable ''sutures'' and should not try to disturb or remove them. They must be gentle while brushing the upper ''teeth''. These teeth will often be tender for several weeks, and there may be some numbness of the teeth and palate for several months.''After three weeks if patients are not having problems with bleeding, they may resume ''exercise'' and ''swimming'', but no diving for two months. They should plan to stay in town and not travel for three weeks to allow for postoperative care and in case bleeding occurs.' "
When to call the doctor after septoplasty or turbinectomy,"'Patients should notify the doctor if they have:''Most surgeons want to know about complications or problems that develop with their patients, so do not\xa0hesitate to call the surgeon to inform them and ask questions about any problems you are experiencing.' A sudden increase in the amount of bleeding from the nose unrelieved by pressure, ice, and head elevation. A fever greater than 101.5 F (38.6 C) that persists despite increasing the amount of fluid and acetaminophen (Tylenol). A person with a fever should try to drink approximately one cup of fluid each waking hour. Persistent sharp pain or headache which is not relieved by the pain medication prescribed. Increased swelling or redness of the nose or eyes."
What is turf toe?,"'Turf toe is an injury to the underside of the big toe and joint at the base of the big toe. This joint, the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint, is commonly known as the ""ball of the foot."" Turf toe is specifically a hyperextension\xa0of the big toe. This joint\xa0sprain of the big toe may involve damage to ligaments, tendons, or bone separately or in combination.''The sprain, often is a result of playing on artificial turf, was first documented in American football players in 1976. Turf toe was recognized as a common injury soon after the invention of AstroTurf in 1964. There are varying degrees of severity of the sports injury. While sometimes mild, which injured athletes can play through, turf toe is sometimes a more serious health condition and can be career-ending.''The amount of damage to the ligaments, tendons, bones, and surrounding tissues determines the severity of the injury. Though often referred to as a ligamentous injury or sprain of the MTP joint, the tendons may be strained and bones may be fractured. American football players such as Tom Brady and Deion Sanders and soccer great George Best are among the notable athletes to have suffered from this sports injury.' "
What is the anatomy of the big toe?,"'The first MTP joint is a hinge joint with sliding and rotational components. There is also a set of paired sesamoid bones underneath the base of the big toe. There are nine ligaments that span the joint, which is covered by a capsular ligamentous balloon-like structure that helps holds the synovial fluid that lubricates the joint. The primary movers or muscles that move the joint of the MTP are the flexor hallicis brevis. Flexor hallicus longus are the muscles that plantar flex or curl the big toe; contraction of the extensor hallicus longus and brevis lift the toe and important muscles in normal foot function.''The primary movements of the joint at the base of the big toe are flexion and extension. The toe is also capable of being moved closer to and away from the foot.'  "
What causes turf toe?,"'Turf toe commonly occurs as an athlete tries to push off of the ground, causing a stretch or hyperextension injury to the structures on the bottom of the big toe.''In a 1993 survey of 80 National Football League players, 36 players reported that they had incurred a turf toe injury and 83% of those players reported that the injury had occurred on artificial turf. Older players and those with more experience in professional football were more likely to have sustained a turf toe injury.''Turf toe injury does cause a lasting decrease in first MTP motion and increased plantar foot contact pressures in football players.''Turf toe, foot, and/or ''toe pain'' (metatarsalgia) may also be caused by ''plantar fasciitis'',\xa0''arthritis'', ''contusions'', ''blisters'', ''bunions'', ''neuromas'', sesamoiditis, ''hammertoes'', ''fractures'', and ''gout''.'  "
What are turf toe symptoms and signs?,"'Turf toe usually has a traumatic sudden onset; most athletes suffering from this sports injury will recall exactly when and how the injury happened. An athlete who suffers from this condition may complain of ''pain'' around the ball of the foot, particularly on the bottom or plantar surface of the metatarsophalangeal joint. Depending on the severity of the injury, this ''pain'' may be present with or without movement, when the toe is bent up toward the body (dorsiflexion of the great toe), or in the toe off portion of the stance phase of gait, and/or against isometric resistance. Intra and/or extracapsular swelling of the joint may be present. Reduction of strength and range of motion is also seen in acute and chronic ranges of motion. Pain and loss of function of the joint and tissues around the joint may cause difficulty ''walking'' and maintaining balance.''A good general health guideline is to compare the injured side to the uninjured side. The injured tissues may cause a lump or gap or a ""crunchy"" feeling at that location from the inflammation. There is typically tenderness and there may be warmth, swelling, and discoloration.' "
When should I seek medical treatment for turf toe?,"""If the pain and discomfort interferes with one's activities of daily living or if someone cannot perform his or her desired activities without pain, he or she should consider seeking medical attention from a doctor. Seek medical advice if the area looks deformed, if there is loss of function or change in body movement, change of sensation, a large amount of swelling with pain, prolonged change of skin or toenail color, or if the affected area becomes warmer than the surrounding areas and becomes exquisitely tender to the touch."" "
How do doctors diagnose turf toe?,"'Turf toe is diagnosed clinically from the health history and physical examination. Athletes who suffer from turf toe will often describe it as having their foot or their toe getting ""stuck"" on the ground at the same time they move forward. The American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons says that the common mechanism of injury is to have the big toe or forefoot stuck on the ground as the heel raises and the foot is extended or plantar flexed. X-ray and/or ''MRI'' testing is sometimes used to support the diagnosis and rule out ''fracture'"". The doctor will ask several questions to determine how the problem began. It can be helpful for the patient to tell the physician about how and when it occurred, how it affects him/her, when it bothers him/her, and what he or she may (or may not) have done to make the pain better or worse. The medical practitioner will examine how the patient's MTP joint functions. These tests may involve holding or moving the toe against resistance. The patient may also be asked to stand, walk, or even run. The nerves in the foot will be tested for injury. Knowledge of the location, intensity, and aggravating or relieving conditions helps the physician and physical therapist to determine the cause of the pain and stage of injury."" "
What is the turf toe treatment? When is surgery needed for turf toe?,"'Acute management of turf toe injuries includes rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). Immobilization will allow the affected tissues to begin to heal without stressing the joint. Ice will help to manage the discomfort and reduce swelling, while compression will aid in stopping bleeding under the skin surface and prevent fluid accumulation in the joint and surrounding areas. Elevation will drain and prevent fluid from accumulating in the joint. ''Over-the-counter'' (OTC) anti-inflammatory medications can help to manage pain and inflammation from the injury. A physician may prescribe stronger medications for inflammation. Once the severity and cause of ''foot pain'' is determined, a course of corrective and rehabilitative actions can be started. Goals of treatment include ''pain management'', increasing muscle strength and range of motion, maintaining cardiovascular conditioning, and re-establishing neuromuscular control. The following treatments and exercises are instituted at the appropriate phases of recovery.''Footwear often does not provide enough support for the person with turf toe. Corrective and OTC orthotics may also be of use. In-shoe supports (such as a steel insole), prophylactic athletic strapping or bracing, and a decreased range of motion may be needed. Occasionally, surgery may be necessary to repair or remove ''scar tissue'' or loose bodies that are in the joint.'   A physical therapist may use electrical medical devices such as ultrasound, various forms of electrical stimulation, LED light therapy (laser), and/or manual therapies to reduce pain and increase circulation to the area to promote healing. Various stretching and strengthening exercises and techniques are gradually added during physical therapy.Rehabilitation will likely include exercises to maintain and improve the range of motion (ROM) of the joint; weight-bearing exercises of the small muscles of the foot along with the calf, lower leg, and core muscles should be addressed; and cardiovascular conditioning often including stationary biking.

Maintenance of fitness levels via modification of activitySubstitute for activities that aggravate the pain and soreness. Running causes the body to have repetitive impact with the ground. The use of bicycling, elliptical trainers, step machines, swimming, or ski machines minimize impact and allow the individual to maintain and improve his or her fitness without causing irritation to the injury.

Biomechanical evaluationThe body will create various changes in the natural movement after an injury. A therapist can evaluate these biomechanical changes and help make the appropriate corrections. Prolonged, uncorrected biomechanical changes may lead to secondary mechanical changes that are painful and difficult to correct and may lead to a poor prognosis and possibly a slow or incomplete recovery from the symptoms.

What follow-up care is needed after foot pain is treated?,"'There may be follow-up tests, scans, or ''X-rays''. A plan for a gradual return to play begins once the pain is reduced and muscle strength and flexibility are restored.' "
Is it possible to prevent turf toe?,"'The turf toe injury often occurs as a result or combination of ''fatigue'', muscle imbalance, or ''stress'' on a body part at an inopportune moment. Appropriate workloads for the stage of training also help prevent injuries. Injury can be prevented through proper preparation for sports participation.''A combination of flexibility, strength, ''fitness'', and dynamic stability may help to prevent injury to the big toe. Appropriate muscle strengthening, cardiovascular conditioning, flexibility, balance, core strength, and posture are major factors in both ''prevention'' and prevention of reinjury. Flexibility or range of motion of the toe joints may be indicators of injury. Flexibility is determined by the amount the toe can be flexed actively and passively. Greater flexibility of the foot and ankle lessen the chance of injury. There is no particular ''exercise'' or stretch that will prevent the injury.''Strength also plays a role. The stronger the body the less susceptible to injury it becomes. One of the keys is that both the muscle that moves the body part through that range of motion and the opposing muscle must also be strong. A decreased range of motion may predispose the joint to injury. Meanwhile, hydration keeps the tissue supple and the muscle working correctly. Unfortunately, there is no magic cure for prevention of turf toe besides developing the components needed for safe participation in sport.''The basic guideline to prevent injuries is to determine if one is in good health by having a physical exam to evaluate cardiovascular function and the possibility of disease or any other general medical problems. Before beginning activities, diseases such as ''gout'', ''diabetes'', certain types of ''arthritis'"", and neuropathies should be treated. Shoes and socks appropriate to one's activity will also be a deterrent to injury, as proper fitting footwear can help minimize the effect of bad biomechanics."" "
What is the prognosis for turf toe? What is the recovery time for turf toe?,"'The recovery time for turf toe is dependent on the severity of the injury. The more severe the injury, the longer the recovery time will be. With severe injuries, surgery may be required. Sometimes complete recovery may not occur, leaving the patient with a stiff or arthritic toe. Upon return to activity, various preventative measures such as wearing a brace, athletic strapping (such as with turf toe strips made from moleskin), or insertion of a full foot shoe orthotic or rigid shoe insoles (such as steel plate supports) are considered.' "
What is Turner syndrome?,"'Turner syndrome is a chromosomal condition that alters development in females. Women with this condition tend to be shorter than average and are usually unable to conceive a child (''infertile'') because of an absence of ovarian function. Other features of this condition that can vary among women who have Turner syndrome include: extra skin on the neck (webbed neck), puffiness or swelling (''lymphedema'') of the hands and feet, skeletal abnormalities, heart defects and kidney problems.''This condition occurs in about 1 in 2,500 female births worldwide, but is much more common among ''pregnancies'' that do not survive to term (miscarriages and stillbirths).''Turner syndrome is a chromosomal condition related to the X chromosome.''Researchers have not yet determined which genes on the X chromosome are responsible for most signs and symptoms of Turner syndrome. They have, however, identified one gene called SHOX that is important for bone development and growth. Missing one copy of this gene likely causes short stature and skeletal abnormalities in women with Turner syndrome.' "
What are the symptoms for Turner syndrome?,"'Girls who have Turner syndrome are shorter than average. They often have normal height for the first three years of life, but then have a slow growth rate. At ''puberty'' they do not have the usual growth spurt.'""Non-functioning ovaries are another symptom of Turner syndrome. Normally a girl's ovaries begin to produce sex hormones (estrogen and ""'progesterone'') at puberty. This does not happen in most girls who have Turner syndrome. They do not start their periods or develop breasts without hormone treatment at the age of puberty.''Even though many women who have Turner have non-functioning ovaries and are ''infertile'', their vagina and womb are totally normal.''In early childhood, girls who have Turner syndrome may have frequent middle ''ear infections''. Recurrent infections can lead to ''hearing loss'' in some cases.''Girls with Turner Syndrome are usually of normal intelligence with good verbal skills and reading skills. Some girls, however, have problems with math, memory skills and fine-finger movements.''Additional symptoms of Turner syndrome include the following:' An especially wide neck (webbed neck) and a low or indistinct hairline. A broad chest and widely spaced nipples. Arms that turn out slightly at the elbow. A heart murmur, sometimes associated with narrowing of the aorta (blood vessel exiting the heart). A tendency to develop high blood pressure (so this should be checked regularly). Minor eye problems that are corrected by glasses. Scoliosis (deformity of the spine) occurs in 10 percent of adolescent girls who have Turner syndrome. The thyroid gland becomes under-active in about 10 percent of women who have Turner syndrome. Regular blood tests are necessary to detect it early and if necessary treat with thyroid replacement. Older or over-weight women with Turner syndrome are slightly more at risk of developing diabetes. Osteoporosis can develop because of a lack of estrogen, but this can largely be prevented by taking hormone replacement therapy."
How is Turner syndrome diagnosed?,"'A diagnosis of Turner syndrome may be suspected when there are a number of typical physical features observed such as webbed neck, a broad chest and widely spaced nipples. Sometimes diagnosis is made at birth because of heart problems, an unusually wide neck or swelling of the hands and feet.''The two main clinical features of Turner syndrome are short stature and the lack of the development of the ovaries.''Many girls are diagnosed in early childhood when a slow growth rate and other features are identified. Diagnosis sometimes takes place later when puberty does not occur.''Turner syndrome may be suspected in ''pregnancy'' during an ''ultrasound'' test. This can be confirmed by ''prenatal'' testing - chorionic villous sampling or ''amniocentesis'' - to obtain cells from the unborn baby for chromosomal analysis. If a diagnosis is confirmed prenatally, the baby may be under the care of a specialist pediatrician immediately after birth.''Diagnosis is confirmed by a blood test, called a karyotype. This is used to analyze the chromosomal composition of the female. More information about this will be discussed in the section ""Is Turner syndrome inherited?""'  "
What is the treatment for Turner syndrome?,"'During childhood and adolescence, girls may be under the care of a pediatric endocrinologist, who is a specialist in childhood conditions of the hormones and metabolism.''Growth hormone injections are beneficial in some individuals with Turner syndrome. Injections often begin in early childhood and may increase final adult height by a few inches.'""Estrogen replacement therapy is usually started at the time of normal puberty, around 12 years to start breast development. Estrogen and progesterone are given a little later to begin a monthly 'period,' which is necessary to keep the womb healthy. Estrogen is also given to prevent ""'osteoporosis''.''Babies'' born with a ''heart murmur'' or narrowing of the aorta may need surgery to correct the problem. A heart expert (cardiologist) will assess and follow up any treatment necessary.''Girls who have Turner syndrome are more likely to get middle ''ear infections''. Repeated infections may lead to ''hearing loss'' and should be evaluated by the pediatrician. An ear, nose and throat specialist (ENT) may be involved in caring for this health issue.''High blood pressure'' is quite common in women who have Turner syndrome. In some cases, the elevated ''blood pressure'' is due to narrowing of the aorta or a kidney abnormality. However, most of the time, no specific cause for the elevation is identified. Blood pressure should be checked routinely and, if necessary, treated with medication. Women who have Turner syndrome have a slightly higher risk of having an under active thyroid or developing ''diabetes''. This should also be monitored during routine health maintenance visits and treated if necessary.''Regular health checks are very important. Special clinics for the care of girls and women who have Turner syndrome are available in some areas, with access to a variety of specialists. Early preventive care and treatment is very important.''Almost all women are ''infertile'', but pregnancy with donor embryos may be possible.''Having appropriate medical treatment and support allows a woman with Turner syndrome to lead a normal, healthy and happy life.'  "
Is Turner syndrome inherited?,"'Turner syndrome is not usually inherited in families. Turner syndrome occurs when one of the two X chromosomes normally found in women is missing or incomplete. Although the exact cause of Turner syndrome is not known, it appears to occur as a result of a random error during the formation of either the eggs or sperm.'""Humans have 46 chromosomes, which contain all of a person's genes and DNA. Two of these chromosomes, the sex chromosomes, determine a person's gender. Both of the sex chromosomes in females are called X chromosomes. (This is written as XX.) Males have an X and a Y chromosome (written as XY). The two sex chromosomes help a person develop ""'fertility'' and the sexual characteristics of their gender.''In Turner syndrome, the girl does not have the usual pair of two complete X chromosomes. The most common scenario is that the girl has only one X chromosome in her cells. Some girls with Turner syndrome do have two X chromosomes, but one of the X chromosomes is incomplete. In another scenario, the girl has some cells in her body with two X chromosomes, but other cells have only one. This is called mosaicism.'  "
How much sleep do children need?,"'Just as with adults, the amount of ''sleep'' children need varies with both age and unique needs of the individual. Below are general guidelines for children of various ages. If your child is happy and thriving, but needs more or fewer hours of ''sleep'"" than indicated below - rest assured they will remain healthy. The National Sleep Foundation's 2015 Guidelines recommend the following for sleep in children and ""'teens''.'  1 to 4 weeks old: Neonates spend approximately 65% to 75% of their daily activity in a sleep state. Waking time is of short duration and it is rare for a child of this age to have a ""day-night"" cycle. Their day-night ""clock"" is not functional until 6 to 8 weeks of age. Mothers of newborns should use their infant's sleep pattern to sleep also. 1 to 4 months old: Infants at this early age require sleep 14 to 17 hours 
of sleep per day. Many begin to develop a day-night cycle during the early weeks of this period. 
At this age, many infants have the ability to sleep evening blocks of 5 to 6 hours without interruption; however most will wake for feedings or diaper changes during the night. 4 to 12 months old: Infants in this age range require 12 to 15 hours of sleep daily. Good news for parents 
- they begin to sleep for longer continuous periods at night. Also, early in this time period, many children benefit from multiple daytime naps, though there is significant variability between different infants.  1 to 3 years old: While specialists point out that most toddlers need about 12 to 14 hours of daily sleep, many may be forced to survive on less. Daycare and erratically spaced car trips necessary for the needs of older siblings often deny or disrupt continuous sleep patterns, most often naps. 3 to 6 years old: This age range commonly needs approximately 10 to 13 hours of sleep per day with younger individuals taking a nap after lunch. Any need for napping is generally absent by the time a child enters 1st grade. 7 to 12 years old: Younger children in this age range commonly require 
9 to 11 hours of sleep each night; pre-teens often receive 9 to 10 hours (though some may require more). 12 to 18 years old: Middle and high school student lifestyle requirements (school, after school activities, dinner and finally homework) often reduce the sleep duration from the recommended 8 to 
10 hours to 6 to 8 hours. The various social network computer websites coupled with cell phone text communication 
and television viewing also may cut into a teenager's sleep time."
Can a lack of sleep impact a child's behavior?,"'The symptoms of a lack of sleep are often obvious to watchful parents. Some of these tell-tale signs include: ' recurrently falling asleep in the car (excluding young infants); requiring extreme stimulation and repetitive reminders to get up in the morning;  behavioral abnormalities such as excessive emotionalism, aggression, and crankiness; and  an older child's (over 8 years of age) recurrent need for an afternoon nap."
What is sleep hygiene?,"'A common definition of sleep hygiene is'' '' ""all behavioral and environmental factors that precede sleep and may interfere with sleep."" Daytime sleepiness and trouble sleeping may be a reflection of poor sleep hygiene. Detailed specifics are listed below. General areas to consider include: ' Personal habits: Establish consistent routines around bedtimes and awakening times  Sleep environment: The bedroom should be a slightly cooler temperature 
(between 60 F to 67 F or 15.5 C to 19.4 C), and eliminate any distracting noise in the bedroom Getting ready for bed: Establish a calming pre-sleep ritual (for example, reading, not watching TV) and  Miscellaneous: Examples include limiting intake of foods/liquids/medications which may disrupt a restful sleep"
What are some common sleep disorders in children?,"""The University of Michigan's ""'Sleep Disorders'' program includes five issues that may be disruptive of good sleep practices. These include: ' Sleep deprivation: As noted in the previously, the amount of sleep generally required varies with age and genetic predisposition. Unfortunately many older children, especially teens, do not receive an appropriate amount of sound sleep. Night waking: All children after the first 7 to 8 months of life start to be more sensitive to internal and external stimuli. If an infant has not yet learned to calm himself and resettle back to sleep, the parents commonly are summoned to help the child return to sleep. This pattern may repeat itself several times each night. Separation anxiety: Children experience this emotion commonly at 5 months of age as well as during the toddler years. Such children become anxious and are unable to enter a comfortable sleep pattern unless parents are present.  Resistance to sleep/settling problems: This occurs when your child does not want to go to bed at a reasonable time. Stalling, temper tantrums, and other resistance patterns are common. Parental persistence generally will resolve this common issue. Parasomnias: Parasomnias are problems that disrupt sleep. Examples include night terrors, grinding of teeth, sleepwalking, etc."
Sleep Apnea symptoms in children,"'Sleep apnea'' is an extremely serious sleep pathology in which the child will struggle to breath and possibly stop ''breathing'"". This process most commonly is a consequence of an enlarged tonsil and adenoid tissues that obstruct the child's upper ""'airway'"". Parents of such children will report that it sounds as if their child is being choked during sleep. Complications of sleep apnea include reduced oxygen to the brain and strain of the right side of the heart. If you believe your child may have sleep apnea, you should discuss your concerns with your child's pediatrician. An evaluation by and ENT (ears-nose-throat) specialist is often indicated. It is helpful to either audio/video record such an episode prior to such an evaluation."" "
Parasomnia symptoms in children,"'Parasomnias are disruptive sleep related events. They include several infrequent events (''periodic limb movement disorder'', ''restless leg syndrome'') and more common events (''teeth grinding'', night terrors, and ''nightmares'', sleepwalking, and ''bedwetting''). Periodic limb movement disorder occurs while asleep and is characterized by repetitive leg and (occasionally) arm movement that persist throughout the night. The child or teenager does not complain of any discomfort or abnormal sensations. In contrast, ''restless leg syndrome'' occurs while awake and affected individuals often describe a sensation of their legs ""falling asleep.""''Nightmares occur during REM (dreaming period) sleep and thus are more common later in the night. The child acts scared but may be comforted by their parents. Such children will often be able to remember their dream. Simple parental reassurance and comforting is effective. In contrast, night terrors occur in non-''REM sleep'' and thus generally within the first 4 hours of sleep. The child may become very violent with crying out in a confused manner as well as thrashing of arms and legs. Routine comforting of the child is not helpful and the child will be confused and bewildered if awakened. Generally, the child will rapidly return to a ""normal"" sleep with no memory of the events in the morning.' "
Confusional arousal symptoms in children,"'Confusional arousals are a variant of night terrors in older infants and toddlers that occur during the first half of the nighttime sleep sequence. It is felt that the child is so deeply asleep and the normal waking pattern at the end of the sleep cycle is suppressed. ''The major distinguishing point of confusional arousals versus night terrors is that the former gradually build from moaning, to crying out, and may culminate in the child standing and yelling out apparent random words or phrases. ''Conversely, night terrors tend to have an acute onset with the very rapid development of thrashing and yelling (commonly for the parents or caregivers). Confusional arousal and night terrors share several key points important for the child:' Don't try to awaken the child. They are asleep and if awakened, will have difficult time falling back to sleep. Anything that upsets the normal sleep rhythms (illness, not sleeping in their own home, and disrupted naps) may trigger either pattern."
Night terror symptoms in children,"'Night terrors are somewhat rare events that have their highest frequency in children 4 to 12 years of age. They are commonly outgrown by adulthood, though some adults manifest the same brain ''EEG'' (""brain wave"") changes during sleepwalking. ''Night terrors differ from nightmares (see previously). Night terrors manifest themselves with the person bolting upright in bed, screaming and thrashing about and stare blankly at the concerned adult who has come to investigate. They tend to occur during the first third of the child\'s sleep cycle. Children characteristically do not ""calm down"" when their parent attempts to soothe what appears to be a fearful experience. EEG studies demonstrate that the child is not awake (i.e. he/she is asleep), and if awakened, has no knowledge or memory of the immediately preceding events. The duration of night terror episodes is short lived. Some authorities believe that night terrors may be a response to sleep deprivation, ''stress'', ''fever'', or ''fatigue''.' "
Narcolepsy symptoms in children,"'Narcolepsy'' is more common in adults than children. It has been defined as ""a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep. Narcolepsy is a chronic condition for which there is no cure."" Research has shown that narcolepsy is not a type of ''seizure'', ''fainting'' episode, or psychological illness. Symptoms of narcolepsy include:' Excessive daytime sleepiness: affected individuals have an uncontrollable need to sleep during the day; Sudden loss of muscle tone (Cataplexy): this may range from slurred speech to total collapse of all voluntary muscles. Emotional stimulation (often positive by nature, for example, laughter) may trigger such an attack; Sleep paralysis: Characterized by a temporary (1-2 minutes) period of the inability to speak or move when falling asleep or waking; Vivid or frightening hallucinations which occur most commonly during REM (dreaming) sleep."
Sleepwalking symptoms in children,"'The onset of sleepwalking (somnambulism) typically presents in prepubertal children most frequently at age 11 to 12, and occurs more often in boys than girls. The overall incidence of sleepwalking is approximately 18%. Like night terrors, the individual is difficult to arouse during the event and does not remember the experience. Sleepwalking most commonly occurs during the first third of the sleep cycle. Some sleepwalkers may also mumble during sleepwalking episodes and occasionally obscene words may be uttered. Medications are rarely necessary to manage sleepwalking episodes. Ensuring a safe environment (protection against falls or ''walking'' out of the house) and maintenance of good sleep habits (avoiding sleep deprivation) are important considerations to prevent sleepwalking.' "
Do teenagers have the same sleep requirements as younger children?,"'Most teens need about 8 to 10 hours of sleep per day. Some studies have indicated that they have a different internal ""sleep clock"" than those younger or older than them. Researchers have demonstrated that teens are truly ""night owls,"" and if left to their own devices, would spontaneously wake from a good night\'s sleep anywhere from 9:00 am to 10:00 am. High school teachers who have classes before this time period have empiric experience to second this observation. Younger children may need anywhere from 12-15 hours (infant: 2 naps plus nighttime long block) to 9-11 hours (middle school child). ' "
How can I teach my child or teenager healthy sleep habits and good sleep hygiene?,"'Primary to establishing good sleep habits is a realization that sleep is a normal and necessary function. However, just as with other normal and necessary functions (for example, eating, toilet training, etc.), a battle may develop between parents and their child in this area. ''All children older than 5 to 6 months of age need to master the ability to self-soothe and relax in order to successfully fall asleep. Depriving them of this skill by either feeding or rocking them to sleep, reading until the child falls asleep, or lying down with the child in order to facilitate falling asleep, is a recipe for frustration - both for the child and the parent. ''Tired children (of any age) intuitively know when they are tired and, if provided the proper environment, will easily and quickly fall asleep. ''When they awaken during the middle of the night they are capable of falling back to sleep without parental intervention. In this circumstance, both child and parents awake refreshed the next morning.' "
What are some ways I can help my child or teenager get a better night's sleep?,"'These ""do\'s"" are adapted from ""''Sleep Problems'': Your Child"" University of Michigan Health Care System and ""Healthy Sleep Tips"" from the National Sleep Foundation.'  Make bedtime a special time. Create special soothing and calming experiences with the opportunity for special ""talks"" or sharing experiences that foster comfort for both child and parent. Study your child so you can determine when he is ready to sleep. Once this is determined you can start the ""get ready for bed"" routine with enough time in advance so the child doesn't get a ""second wind"". Keep the bedtime routine consistent and simple. Mental and physical stimulation is counter productive. Dim lights starting about 10 – 15 minutes before going to sleep.  Bright lights act as a stimulant to the child's brain.   Keep the bedtime routine portable. For example, it can occur whether at home or outside of the home (for example, in a motel during vacation). Make sure your child is both mentally and physically tired at the end of the day. Children need between 30 to 60 minutes per day of vigorous playtime (depending on the age). Besides fostering good sleep habits, such a program will help maintain optimum weight gain. Establish a restful atmosphere. Keep the lights dim, limit noise and electronic devices. Teens should turn off computers/TV's and cell phones when retiring to bed. 
The bedroom temperature should be between 60 F and 67 F or 15.5 C to 19.4 C. Avoid afternoon naps in children over 6 years of age."
"What are some ""don'ts"" for getting my child or teen to sleep?","'These ""don\'ts"" are adapted from ""Sleep Problems: Your Child"" University of Michigan Health Care System.' Don't put your child to bed with a bottle of juice, milk or formula. Sugar in such drinks promotes tooth decay. Water is acceptable. Don't fill up the bed with toys. Limit the crib/bed to one to two ""special"" items. Too many items are over stimulating and the child will have a hard time not playing with them. Eliminate any object that might be a safety hazard. Don't threaten to send your child to bed as a punishment. Bedtime should be an enjoyable experience that will promote falling asleep in a timely fashion. Avoid caffeine before bed: Caffeinated drinks such as cola, chocolate, iced tea, 
energy drinks, etc. Limit TV in the afternoon and at night. TV stimulation may carry on longer than you suspect. Having a TV in a child's room may be counterproductive to getting your child or teen to sleep. A 2014 National Sleep Foundation study indicates that 72% of children 6 years old to 17 years old have at least one electronic device in their bedroom.  These children may get up to one hour less sleep per night as their peers without such devices in the bedroom."
"""Is it safe for me to take Tylenol?""","'Tylenol'' is currently the most popular painkiller in the United States. Americans take over 8 billion pills (tablets or capsules) of Tylenol each year. Acetaminophen is the general (generic) name for Tylenol, which is a brand name. Although acetaminophen is contained in over 200 medications, most of them do not have the name ""Tylenol"" on their labels. Moreover, just about every patient with ''liver disease'' in my practice invariably asks:'""These questions highlight the public's awareness of the potential for acetaminophen to cause liver damage or injury.""'Tylenol is a very effective ''pain''-killing (analgesic) and ''fever''-reducing (anti-pyretic) agent. It is also a very safe drug as long as the recommended dosage is not exceeded. In fact, the use of Tylenol instead of ''aspirin'' to treat ''fevers'"" in infants has greatly reduced the occurrence of Reye's syndrome, an often fatal form of liver failure. Ironically, however, taking too much Tylenol (an overdose) can also cause liver failure, although by a different process (mechanism), as discussed below.""   ""Is it safe for me to take Tylenol?"" or ""How much Tylenol can I take?"""
Do the recommended doses of Tylenol cause any liver damage?,"""Some early reports did describe the occurrence of chronic liver disease that was associated with the long-term use of Tylenol in recommended doses. These studies were published in the 1970's, however, and I suspect that many of these patients may have had unrecognized chronic ""'hepatitis C'' infection. Anyway, today, the consensus is that the usual doses of Tylenol cause significant liver damage only rarely, or not at all in people with normal livers.''Likewise, a person with liver disease does not appear to be at an increased risk of developing additional liver injury from taking Tylenol. This is so-regardless of the cause of the liver disease and provided the patient does not drink alcohol regularly. Thus, Tylenol is quite safe to use in the recommended doses in patients with acute (brief duration) or chronic (long duration) ''hepatitis''. For example, Tylenol is routinely prescribed to treat the ''flu-like symptoms'' that can be caused by ''interferon'' treatment for patients with chronic ''hepatitis''. Keep in mind, however, that all ''drugs'', including Tylenol, should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with severe liver disease, such as advanced ''cirrhosis'' (scarring of the liver) or liver failure.''Even though Tylenol most likely does not cause serious liver damage in recommended doses, it can cause elevations of ''liver enzymes'"" in the blood suggesting injury to the liver. In a study of 145 healthy subjects who were randomized to receive placebo or 4 grams of Tylenol daily for two weeks, subjects in the placebo group experienced no elevations of ALT, a liver enzyme, but 33%-44% of the subjects in the Tylenol group had ALT elevations greater than three times the upper limits of normal. The highest ALT elevation was greater than 500 which is approximately 10 times the upper limit of normal. All enzyme elevations returned to normal after stopping Tylenol. Thus, recommended doses of Tylenol given to healthy subjects for two weeks can cause mild to moderate reversible liver injury. Tylenol, like all other medications should be used cautiously under a doctor's supervision with monitoring of liver enzyme levels."" "
Why should we know that the generic name of Tylenol is acetaminophen?,"'For the remainder of this discussion, we will refer to the generic name acetaminophen, rather than to the brand name Tylenol. We have decided to do this to emphasize the need for people to read the labels of medicine bottles carefully. As mentioned above, the labels usually will say acetaminophen rather than Tylenol. For example, each tablespoon of the common nighttime ''cold'' remedy, NyQuil, contains 500 milligrams (mg) of acetaminophen. Similarly, each tablet of ''hydrocodone/acetaminophen'' (''Vicodin''), a popular, potent painkiller that contains a narcotic, has also 500, 650, or 750 mg of acetaminophen, depending on the formulation.''As already mentioned, an overdose of acetaminophen can cause liver damage. This damage occurs in a dose-related manner. (Some other medications can cause liver injury in an unpredictable fashion that is unrelated to the dose.) In other words, liver injury from acetaminophen occurs only when someone takes more than a certain amount of the drug. Likewise, the higher the dose, the greater is the likelihood of the damage. Moreover, this liver injury from an overdose of acetaminophen is a serious matter because the damage can be severe and result in liver failure and death. In fact, acetaminophen overdose is the leading cause of acute (rapid onset) liver failure in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.' "
Just how much acetaminophen is safe to take?,"'For the average healthy adult, the recommended maximum dose of acetaminophen over a 24 hour period is four grams (4000 mg) or eight extra-strength pills. (Each extra-strength pill contains 500 mg and each regular strength pill contains 325 mg.) A person who ''drinks'' more than two alcoholic ''beverages'' per day, however, should not take more than two grams of acetaminophen over 24 hours, as discussed below. For children, the dose is based on their weight and age, and explicit instructions are given in the package insert. If these guidelines for adults and children are followed, acetaminophen is safe and carries essentially no risk of liver injury.''On the other hand, a single dose of 7 to 10 grams of acetaminophen (14 to 20 extra-strength tablets) can cause liver injury in the average healthy adult. Note that this amount is about twice the recommended maximum dose for a 24 hour period. In children, a single dose of 140 mg/kg (body weight) of acetaminophen can result in liver injury. Amounts of acetaminophen as low as 3 to 4 grams in a single dose or 4 to 6 grams over 24 hours have been reported to cause severe liver injury in some people, sometimes even resulting in death. It seems that certain individuals like those who ''regularly drink alcohol'', are more prone than others to developing acetaminophen-induced liver damage. To understand this increased susceptibility in some people, it is useful to know how acetaminophen is processed (metabolized) in the liver and how the drug causes liver injury.'  "
How is acetaminophen processed (metabolized) in the body?,"'The liver is the primary site in the body where acetaminophen is metabolized. In the liver, acetaminophen first undergoes sulphation (binding to a sulphate molecule) and glucuronidation (binding to a glucuronide molecule) before being eliminated from the body by the liver. The parent compound, acetaminophen, and its sulphate and glucuronide compounds (metabolites) are themselves actually not harmful. An excessive amount of acetaminophen in the liver, however, can overwhelm (saturate) the sulphation and glucuronidation pathways. When this happens, the acetaminophen is processed through another pathway, the cytochrome P-450 system. From acetaminophen, the P-450 system forms an intermediate metabolite referred to as NAPQI, which turns out to be a toxic compound. Ordinarily, however, this toxic metabolite is rendered harmless (detoxified) by another pathway, the glutathione system.' "
How does an overdose of acetaminophen cause liver injury?,"""The answer is that liver damage from acetaminophen occurs when the glutathione pathway is overwhelmed by too much of acetaminophen's metabolite, NAPQI. Then, this toxic compound accumulates in the liver and causes the damage. Furthermore, alcohol and certain medications such as phenobarbital, ""'phenytoin'' (''Dilantin''), or ''carbamazepine'' (''Tegretol'') (anti-''seizure'' medications) or ''isoniazid'' (INH, Nydrazid, Laniazid) - (anti-''tuberculosis'' drug) can significantly increase the damage. They do this by making the cytochrome P-450 system in the liver more active. This increased P-450 activity, as you might expect, results in an increased formation of NAPQI from the acetaminophen. Additionally, chronic alcohol use, as well as the fasting state or poor ''nutrition'"", can each deplete the liver's glutathione. So, alcohol both increases the toxic compound and decreases the detoxifying material. Accordingly, the bottom line in an acetaminophen overdose is that when the amount of NAPQI is too much for the available glutathione to detoxify, liver damage occurs."" "
Is overdose with acetaminophen usually accidental or intentional?,"'In the U.S., ''suicide'' attempts account for over two thirds of acetaminophen-related liver injury, whereas accidental overdose accounts for only one third of the cases. In young children, accidental overdose accounts for an even lower percent of the cases. Among these often-curious toddlers, accidental overdose is responsible for less than 10% of the instances of acetaminophen toxicity. The vast majority of these accidental overdoses were due to unintentional overdoses given by the caregivers of the children.' "
How can accidental overdose be avoided in adults?,"'To avoid unintentional overdoses among adults, here are some suggestions.' Read the labels of the medication bottles carefully and determine the amount or strength of acetaminophen in each pill or spoonful. Become familiar with all of the other medications that you are taking. Remember that over 200 drugs contain acetaminophen as one of the ingredients and that certain drugs, such as phenobarbital, can significantly increase liver damage. Before you take the medication, write down (record) the maximum safe number of pills or spoonfuls that you can ingest over 24 hours. Stick to that quantity and do not deviate. If, however, you are unsure of the safe number of doses or think that you need to take more than you should, call your doctor or pharmacist. When you receive a prescription for a new medication, ask your doctor or pharmacist whether it affects the body's metabolism (processing) of the other medications that you are taking, including acetaminophen. If you have been drinking alcohol regularly, do not exceed taking 2 grams of acetaminophen over 24 hours. Be honest with yourself about the ingestion of alcohol. Record the number of pills or spoonfuls of acetaminophen and the time that you take them."
How can overdose be avoided in children?,"'The dosing of acetaminophen for children, as previously mentioned, depends on their weight and age. To avoid overdose in children, follow the same procedures for them as suggested above for adults. Beyond that, two adults should independently determine the dose of acetaminophen for a child. If there is disagreement about the recommended dose, consult a pharmacist or physician. These precautions are not excessive when you consider that in one experimental mock situation, only 30% of adults correctly calculated the dose of acetaminophen for their child. If a baby-sitter is caring for a sick child, parents should carefully write out the dose and schedule for the administration of the drug. Each year, in children with high ''fevers'' who were given repetitive doses of acetaminophen, deaths have occurred due to accidental overdose and the resulting liver damage.' "
What are the symptoms and signs of  acetaminophen-induced liver damage?,"'Three clinical stages (phases) of acetaminophen-induced liver injury have been described.''During the first phase, that is, the initial 12 to 24 hours or so after ingestion, the patient experiences ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''.''For the next perhaps 12 to 24 hours, which is the second phase or the so-called inactive (latent) phase, the patient feels well.'""In the third phase, which begins about 48 to as late as 72 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen, liver blood test abnormalities begin to appear. Most notably, extremely high (abnormal) levels of the liver blood tests, AST and ALT, are common with this type of liver injury. The outcome (prognosis) of the liver injury can be predicted fairly accurately on the basis of the patient's clinical exam and blood tests. For example, at one extreme, if the patient develops severe acid buildup in the blood, ""'kidney failure'', ''bleeding disorders'', or ''coma'', then death is almost certain. Only a ''liver transplant'' can possibly save such a patient.'  "
What should be done if acetaminophen toxicity is suspected?,"""A physician should evaluate the individual immediately. Remember that bringing the bottles of acetaminophen and all of the person's other medications to the emergency room is always useful. The risk that an acetaminophen overdose will cause liver injury correlates with the blood level of acetaminophen relative to the time the drug was taken. Physicians, therefore, are able to estimate the patient's probability of developing liver injury after an overdose. To make this determination, they obtain the patient's history of acetaminophen ingestion and measure the blood level of the drug. With this information, the doctor then can refer to a table (nomogram) that provides an estimate of the risk of developing liver injury. The accuracy of this estimate, however, depends on the reliability of the time of ingestion and whether the acetaminophen was taken over a period of time or all at once.""""With suspected acetaminophen overdose, the doctors usually will pump (gavage) the patient's stomach to remove pill fragments. In reality, many individuals who overdose with acetaminophen in a ""'suicide'' attempt will have taken other pills in addition. Some doctors, therefore, will consider treating the patient with activated charcoal, which binds (and thereby inactivates) many medications. However, this treatment is controversial because of a concern that the activated charcoal may also bind the antidote for acetaminophen overdose.''Patients who are thought to be at a high-risk or even only at a possible risk of developing acetaminophen liver injury should be given the antidote, N-acetyl cysteine (Mucomyst) orally (or intravenously in Europe). This drug works by indirectly replenishing glutathione. The glutathione, as you recall, detoxifies the toxic metabolite of the acetaminophen. The N-acetyl cysteine is most effective when administered within 12 to 16 hours after the acetaminophen was taken. Most physicians however, will administer N-acetyl cysteine even if the patient is first seen beyond this 16 hour period. Thus, a British study showed that patients already with liver failure who then received the N-acetyl cysteine were more likely to survive than patients who did not receive the antidote. Moreover, the survival occurred in these patients regardless of the time of initial administration of N-acetyl cysteine. Finally, people who recover from acetaminophen-induced liver damage are left, fortunately, with no residual or ongoing (chronic) liver disease.''Previous Medical Author and Editor: Medical Author: Tse-Ling Fong, M.D.''Medical Editor: Leslie J. Schoenfield, M.D., Ph.D.' "
What is the purpose of ear tube placement?,"'Middle ''ear infections'' (''otitis media'') are common in children. When a child has repeated ''ear infections'' or fluid build-up in the ears that do not go away easily or there are ''hearing'' problems or speech delays, a doctor may recommend surgery to insert an ear tube to allow the eardrum to equalize the pressure.''The surgery, called a myringotomy, is a tiny incision in the eardrum. Any fluid, usually thickened secretions will be removed. In most situations, a small ''plastic'' tube (a tympanostomy tube) is inserted into the eardrum to keep the middle ear aerated for a prolonged period.. These ventilating tubes remain in place for six months to several years. Eventually, they will move out of the eardrum (extrude) and fall into the ear canal. Your doctor may remove the tube during a routine office visit or it may simply fall out of the ear.''Less common conditions that may call for the placement of ear tubes are malformation of the eardrum or Eustachian tube, '""Down's syndrome""', ''cleft palate'', and barotrauma (middle ear injury caused by a reduction of air pressure), according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology.'  "
Ear tubes side effects: What are risks and complications of ear tubes?,"'While ear tube surgery is common, minor complications can occur in up to half of the children who have them inserted. Complications include:'  Failure to resolve the ear infections. Thickening of the eardrum over time, which affects hearing in a small percentage of patients. Persistent perforation after the tube falls out of the eardrum. Chronic ear drainage. Infection Hearing loss Scarring of the eardrum Ear canal skin tissue and material getting trapped inside the eardrum (cholesteatoma) Possible need to keep the ear dry and to use ear plugs Foreign body reaction to the tube itself - for example, an allergic reaction to the tube material (rare) While not a complication, some patients may have a need for further and more aggressive surgery such as tonsil, adenoid, sinus, or ear surgery."
What happens before the ear tubes procedure?,"'In most situations, the surgery is performed as an outpatient (no overnight stay usually required), at either the hospital or an outpatient surgery center. An anesthesiologist will monitor your child throughout the procedure. Usually, the anesthesiologist reviews the medical history before surgery. If your doctor has ordered preoperative laboratory studies, arrange to have these done several days in advance.'""If your child is old enough to understand what surgery is, be honest and up front as you explain the upcoming surgery. A calming and reassuring attitude will greatly ease your child's ""'anxiety''. Most children will feel better having had the pressure relieved in their ears.''Your child must not eat or drink anything 6 to 12 hours prior to their time of surgery; this includes even water or chewing gum. Anything in the stomach increases the chances of an anesthetic complication.''If your child is sick or has a ''fever'' the day before surgery, call the office. If your child wakes up sick the day of surgery, still proceed to the surgical facility as planned. Your doctor will decide if it is safe to proceed with surgery. However, if your child has ''chickenpox'', do not bring your child to the office or to the surgical facility.' "
What to do the day of ear tubes surgery,"'It is important that you know precisely what time you are to check-in with the surgical facility, and that you allow sufficient preparation time. Bring the required papers and forms with you, including the preoperative orders and history sheets. Your child should wear comfortable loose fitting clothes (pajamas are permissible). Leave all jewelry and valuables at home. They may bring a favorite toy, stuffed animal, or blanket.' "
What happens during ear tube placement?,"'Your child may be given a medication to help him or her relax prior to entering the operating room (premedication). In the operating room, the anesthesiologist will usually use a mixture of ''gas'' and an intravenous medication for sedation. During the procedure, which typically takes 10 to 15 minutes, your child will be continuously monitored including pulse oximeter (oxygen saturation of blood) and cardiac rhythm (''EKG''). The surgical team is prepared for any emergency. In addition to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, there will be a nurse and a surgical technician in the room.''After the anesthetic takes effect, the doctor, using an operating microscope, makes a tiny incision in the eardrum through the ''outer ear'' canal. There will be no external incisions or ''stitches''. Fluid will be suctioned from the ear, and a tube inserted in the eardrum. Usually, drops will be placed in the ear, and a cotton plug inserted in the ear canal.' "
What happens after ear tubes surgery?,"'After surgery, your child will be taken to the recovery room to be monitored by a nurse. You may be invited into the recovery room as your child becomes aware of their surroundings and starts looking for you. Your child should be able to go home the same day as the surgery once they have fully recovered from the anesthetic. This usually takes less than one hour.''Your child may resume a normal ''diet'' after he or she has fully recovered from the anesthetic. Even though they may be hungry immediately after surgery, it is best to feed them slowly to prevent postoperative ''nausea'' and ''vomiting''. Occasionally, children may vomit one or two times immediately after surgery. If ''vomiting'' persists, your doctor may prescribe medication to settle the stomach.' "
What are the general instructions and follow-up care for ear tubes?,"'An appointment for a follow-up ear check-up is usually arranged 14 to 28 days after the procedure. At this visit, the position and function of the tubes will be assessed.'""Usually, eardrops will be given to you the day of surgery. The surgeon will often place the same drops in the ear following the placement of the tubes. They are usually used after surgery for three days (3-4 drops each ear 3 times per day). If there is drainage from the ear after three days, you may be instructed to continue using the drops until the day before your office visit or as per doctor's instructions. Discontinue these drops if they cause severe ""'pain'' or a skin ''rash''.''You can ""pump"" them into the ear by pushing on the soft cartilage tissue located in front of the ear canal (medically termed the tragus).''Ear drainage may occur immediately after the procedure or at any time while the tubes are in place.''Yellow clear fluid or mucous may drain for several days to weeks after the surgery.''It is not unusual to see a bloody discharge following surgery. Cotton can be kept in the ear canal and changed as needed to keep dry.''If after the immediate post-operative period, profuse, foul-smelling discharge drains from the ear, an infection is the possible cause. If this occurs, begin by using eardrops for three days. If the drainage continues beyond three days, call the doctor to determine if additional medicine and/or an office visit is necessary.''Avoiding water for children with ear tubes or routine water precautions (wearing earplugs or headbands) is generally not recommended while tubes are in place with some exceptions. Water protection may be needed if ''pain'' results when the ears get wet, if there is prolonged drainage from the ear or for children who dive more than 6 ''feet'' under water, dunk their head in soapy bath tub water, or swim in areas other than chlorinated pools. There is an increased risk of infection in lake or pond water, as opposed to chlorinated water found in ''swimming'"" pools. Follow your doctor's advice regarding water precautions.""'Tympanostomy tubes usually stay in place from 6 to 18 months. If they stay in longer than two to three years, they may need to be surgically removed. It is important to have an ear check-up about every six months during this period. An audiogram is usually obtained at some point after the ear has healed. The tubes eventually fall out of the eardrum as the ear heals. Some children may have mild discomfort or bloody drainage at this time. The small hole in the eardrum at the old tube site usually heals within several weeks. Your doctor will instruct you when it is safe to allow water in the ears.''In some cases, insertion of ear tubes must be repeated if the tubes fall out and symptoms recur.'  "
What is type 1 diabetes?,"""Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that affects blood sugar regulation. A person's immune system makes antibodies that destroy the insulin-producing islet beta cells in the pancreas. The pancreas then fails to make insulin. Without insulin, blood sugar increases and cannot be delivered to the muscles and brain where it is needed. Over time, ""'high blood sugar'' can lead to a number of complications such as kidney, nerve, and eye damage, and ''cardiovascular disease''. Moreover, cells do not receive the glucose necessary for energy and normal function.''Because type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, cures will likely involve replacing the damaged pancreas or promoting regeneration or functioning of the pancreas. Because people with type 1 diabetes can no longer produce their own insulin, they must inject doses of insulin. They must match the amount of insulin they inject with their ''diet''. Keeping blood sugar in a normal, healthy range (what doctors call ""good glycemic control"") is the key to preventing long-term complications.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes?,"'Type 1 diabetes can be subtle or life threatening. Some people have no symptoms (asymptomatic), and type 1 diabetes is not detected until blood or urine lab studies are done. If a person does have type 1 ''diabetes symptoms'', early signs and symptoms are''Other signs and symptoms are''People with type 1 diabetes may experience more frequent infections of the skin or respiratory tract.''Undiagnosed type 1 diabetes can become life threatening if a person goes into ketoacidosis (a state in which elevated blood sugar leads to other metabolic changes).'   weight loss, thirst, and excessive urination. an unusual odor to the urine, urinary tract infections (UTIs), yeast infections, unexplained weight loss, feeling hungry even after meals, stomach pain, diarrhea, fatigue, swollen ankles, darkening skin around the armpits or groin, night sweats, blurry vision, fruity or unusual breath, hair loss, and generally feeling unwell (malaise)."
What is the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes?,"'The major process that happens in type 1 diabetes is that the pancreas can no longer produce insulin. ''Type 2 diabetes'' is more a result of ''insulin resistance'' (cells not being able to use insulin effectively or at all), that is, it takes a large amount of insulin to move glucose out of the blood and into the cells. Over time, people with type 2 diabetes also may experience decreased insulin production in the pancreas. In type 1 diabetes, over time, the body can also develop insulin resistance -- especially in people who gain a lot of weight while using insulin. This means there is some overlap in treatment and ''diet'' for people who have had diabetes of either type for a long time.' "
How many people have type 1 diabetes?,'Most people with diabetes (90%-95% of all those with the condition) have type 2 diabetes. Around 1.25 million American children and adults have type 1 diabetes.' 
Is type 1 diabetes a genetic (inherited) disease?,"'There is a strong genetic link with type 1 diabetes. This can be tested for by looking at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype. First-degree relatives are at higher risk. However, with any genetic condition, it is important to remember that gene expression changes in response to the epigenetic (nutritional) environment, and risk factors can be addressed with a health care professional or ''nutrition''/functional/naturopathic practitioner knowledgeable about epigenetics.' "
How do you develop type 1 diabetes (causes)?,"'Type 1 diabetes is caused by the autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin. It is not known why the autoimmune destruction happens. However, there are some known triggers, for example:''The underlying cause of type 1 diabetes usually is not known.' Genetics, including family history and the prenatal environment of the mother, can put people at risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Exposures to chemicals, especially ones called endocrine disruptors, found in plastics Viral infections also can trigger the autoimmune process. Early or late introduction of certain foods to infants has been shown to trigger type 1 diabetes in research studies. Introducing fruit before 5 months of age or waiting until later than 7 months to introduce grains such as oats and rice increases the risk of diabetes. However, research shows that breastfeeding reduces these risks."
What are risk factors for developing type 1 diabetes?,"'Risk factors for developing type 1 diabetes include prenatal exposures, exposures to food and environmental toxins early in life, and geography.' Prenatal exposures include maternal preeclampsia or metabolic syndrome . Environmental exposures include chemicals, especially those found in plastics and foods, specifically introduction of gluten, casein (the protein in dairy) or fruit before 4 months of age or late introduction (after 7 months of age) to grains (gluten, oat, and rice) and casein. Viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus or EBV (mononucleosis), Coxsackie, CMV, and other infections can also be risk factors for developing type 1 diabetes. Living in a northern climate is a risk factor that has not been fully explained."
Type 1 diabetes and pregnancy,"'Pregnant'' women with type 1 diabetes need to be extra careful to maintain good blood sugar control. If blood sugar runs too high during ''pregnancy'', there is an increased risk of complications including having a very large baby, having the baby too early, and having ''preeclampsia'', a condition that can be life threatening to the mother and baby. You can minimize the risk for complications by paying close attention to blood sugar, eating a low-glycemic diet, and staying regularly active.' "
How is type 1 diabetes diagnosed?," Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed with a blood test for blood glucose. If it is greater than 125 when fasting or greater than 200 randomly, a diagnosis of diabetes is made. To confirm whether it is type 1 or type 2 diabetes, blood tests are used to measure antibodies. Additionally, a presumptive diagnosis can be made based on glucose or ketones in the urine. A c-peptide test can determine how much insulin the pancreas is producing. Genetic testing, such as HLA subtyping, can add further understanding of the disease."
What is the treatment for type 1 diabetes? Can it be cured?,"'Currently, type 1 diabetes cannot be cured. People with type 1 diabetes require injectable insulin because their pancreas does not produce enough on its own. There are different ''types of insulin'' and different routes of administration. Most people with type 1 diabetes use both a long-acting insulin (sometimes called a basal insulin), and inject additional insulin before or after meals (sometimes called regular or short-acting insulin) to match the carbohydrate content of the meal. An ''insulin pump'"" may also be used to optimize insulin delivery to the body's needs."" Unfortunately, one of the major side effects of insulin is weight gain. People with type 1 diabetes can reduce weight gain by:Eating a healthy low-carbohydrate (low-glycemic load) diet,Getting plenty of exercise, andLearning to use insulin correctly in order to use just the right amountDiet and level of activity. Eating a healthy low-carbohydrate (low-glycemic load) diet, Getting plenty of exercise, and Learning to use insulin correctly in order to use just the right amount Diet and level of activity. Because type 1 diabetes is characterized by the loss of insulin production in the pancreas, insulin must be provided in the form of an injection. In addition to insulin, treatment includes diet changes to minimize sugars and make sure carbohydrates are matched with the appropriate dose of insulin. There are different forms of insulin and different ways it can be administered. A type 1 diabetes diet should focus on lots of vegetables and healthy proteins such as fish, chicken, and beans; and should be low in sweets and processed baked goods. A healthy diet helps blood sugar control and helps with weight loss."
Is there a type 1 diabetes diet?,"'The basics of a type 1 ''diabetes diet'' include making sure carbohydrate intake is matched with insulin and choosing healthy options to maximize ''nutrition'' in each calorie. People with type 1 diabetes will find it is easiest to match carbohydrates to insulin if they follow a low-glycemic load (index) diet, so that the impact of carbohydrates on blood sugar is slow and gradual. This also makes it easier to predict and match to required insulin.''Because weight gain can be a side effect of injecting insulin, a type 1 diabetes diet should be healthy and low in calories to help the person maintain or ''lose weight''. Food lists of low-glycemic load options can help people learn what to include in their diet.' "
Does exercise affect blood sugar levels?," Exercise is important for everyone, including people with type 1 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes need to be careful to monitor their blood sugar before, during, and after exercise and have snacks with them in case blood sugar goes too low. When people exercise, the muscles use insulin to access blood sugar for fuel. This can lead to lower than expected blood sugar. Exercise also may trigger release of stored glucose from the liver. This can lead to higher than expected blood sugar. This is why it is important to check blood sugar, especially when beginning a new exercise program. People with type 1 diabetes may see their blood sugar go up or down with exercise."
What is the life expectancy for someone with type 1 diabetes?,"'Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that people with type 1 diabetes live about 11 years less than average; however, new research also suggests this differential can be reduced with good glycemic control. Most people with type 1 diabetes die from complications of type 1 diabetes such as ''heart disease'' or kidney disease. Thus, preventing complications and following a healthy lifestyle that prevents ''heart disease'' and controls blood sugar are the best things people with type 1 diabetes can do to live a long, healthy life.' "
What are the complications of type 1 diabetes?,"'Uncontrolled blood sugar can lead to a number long-term complications associated with diabetes such as''If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes you can prevent complications by maintaining a healthy blood sugar level, eating a healthy diet rich in vegetables, and staying physically active.' diabetic eye disease, foot problems, neuropathy, sexual problems, urinary tract infections, skin infections, yeast infections, a higher risk for other infections, heart disease, and kidney disease."
Can type 1 diabetes be prevented?,"'While there is not any definitive way to prevent type 1 diabetes, parents can be aware of the risk factors in the prenatal period and in early childhood to minimize risk. For people who already have type 1 diabetes, prevention of complications through good glycemic control and regular medical screening is key.' "
Which specialties of doctors treat type 1 diabetes?,"'Adult and pediatric endocrinologists, specialists in treating hormonal disorders and disorders of the endocrine system, manage patients with diabetes. A number of primary care doctors including family and internal medicine doctors, naturopathic doctors, or nurse practitioners also may care for people with type 1 diabetes. When complications arise, people with diabetes often consult other specialists, including neurologists, gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists, surgeons, and cardiologists. Nutritionists, integrative and functional medicine doctors, and physical activity experts such as personal trainers are also important members of a ''diabetes treatment'' team.' "
What is diabetes?,"'Diabetes mellitus'' is a group of metabolic diseases, all of which have in common ''high blood sugar'' (glucose) levels that result from problems with ''insulin'' secretion, its action, or both. Normally, blood glucose levels are tightly controlled by a hormone produced by the pancreas known as insulin. When blood glucose levels rise (for example, after eating food), insulin is released from the pancreas to normalize the glucose level.' "
What is type 1 diabetes?,"'An absolute lack of insulin, usually due to destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas, is the main problem in ''type 1 diabetes''.''Type 1 diabetes'' was formerly referred to as juvenile ''diabetes'' or insulin-dependent ''diabetes'' mellitus (IDDM). Its causes are different from type II ''diabetes'', as will be reviewed in this article.'  "
What is type 2 diabetes?,"'Type 2 diabetes'' was previously called non-insulin dependent ''diabetes mellitus'' (NIDDM), or adult onset ''diabetes'' mellitus (AODM). People who have ''type 2 diabetes'"" can still produce insulin, but do so relatively inadequately for their body's needs. ""'Type 2 diabetes'' typically occurs in individuals over 30 years of age, and its incidence increases with advancing age. In contrast, ''type 1 diabetes'' is most often diagnosed in young people.''Genetics plays a role in the development of ''type 2 diabetes'', and having a family history and close relatives with the condition increases your risk; however, there are other risk factors, with ''obesity'' being the most significant. There is a direct relationship between the degree of ''obesity'' and the risk of developing ''type 2 diabetes'' for both children and adults. It has been estimated that the risk of developing ''type 2 diabetes'' doubles for every 20% increase over desirable body weight.' "
What are the differences between the causes of type 1 and type 2?,"'Type 1 diabetes'' causes''Type 1 diabetes'"" is believed to be due to an autoimmune process, in which the body's immune system mistakenly targets its own tissues (islet cells in the pancreas). In people with ""'type 1 diabetes'', the beta cells of the pancreas that are responsible for insulin production are attacked by the misdirected immune system. This tendency for the immune system to destroy the beta cells of the pancreas is likely to be, at least in part, genetically ''inherited'', although the exact reasons that this process happens are not fully understood.''Exposure to certain viral infections (''mumps'' and Coxsackie ''viruses'') or other environmental toxins have been suggested as possible reasons why the abnormal antibody responses develop that cause damage to the pancreas cells.''The primary problem in type 2 ''diabetes'"" is the inability of the body's cells to use insulin properly and efficiently, leading to ""'hyperglycemia'' (''high blood sugar'') and ''diabetes''. This problem affects mostly the cells of muscle and fat tissues and results in a condition known as ''insulin resistance''. In type 2 diabetes, there also is a steady decline of beta cells that worsens the process of elevated blood sugars. In the beginning, if someone is resistant to insulin, the body can at least partially increase the production of insulin enough to overcome the level of resistance. Over time, if production decreases and enough insulin cannot be released, blood ''sugar'' levels rise. In many cases, this actually means the pancreas produces larger than normal quantities of insulin, but the body is not able to use it effectively. A major feature of type 2 diabetes is a lack of sensitivity to insulin by the cells of the body (particularly fat and muscle cells).''Both diabetes type 1 and diabetes type 2, require good control over their ''diet'' by eating foods that help regulate blood ''sugar'', ''exercise'', and in most patients, medical treatments to allow the patient to remain in good health.' "
What are the differences between the signs and symptoms of type 1 vs. type 2 diabetes?,"'Signs and ''symptoms of diabetes'', whether type 1 or type 2, do not differ.'   Early diabetes may not produce any symptoms at all. When symptoms do occur, the age of onset is typically different, with type 1 diabetes being diagnosed most often in younger people (in a child, for example), while type 2 diabetes is diagnosed more commonly in adults. However, this is not always the case. The increasing incidence of obesity among children and adolescents has caused a rise in the development of type 2 diabetes in young people. Further, some adults with diabetes may be diagnosed with a form of late-onset type 1 diabetes."
How are the signs and symptoms similar?,"'There isn\'t a difference between the symptoms of either disease. The ""classic"" symptoms are the same for both diabetes type 1 and type 2:''For both type 1 and type 2, early symptoms of untreated diabetes arise due to elevated blood sugar levels and the presence of glucose in the urine. High amounts of glucose in the urine can cause increased urine output and ''dehydration''. ''Dehydration'', in turn, causes increased ''thirst''.''A lack of insulin or an inability of insulin to work properly affects protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism. Insulin normally encourages the storage of fat and protein, so when there is inadequate insulin or poorly functioning insulin, this eventually leads to ''weight loss'' despite an increase in appetite.''Some untreated diabetes patients also experience generalized symptoms like ''fatigue'', ''nausea'', and ''vomiting''. People with diabetes are also at risk for infections of the bladder, skin, and vaginal areas. Changes in blood glucose levels can lead to ''blurred vision''. When blood sugar levels are extremely high, lethargy and ''coma'' can result.' Increased urine output (polyuria) Increased thirst (polydipsia) Increased hunger (Polyphagia ) Unexplained weight loss"
How many people have diabetes?,'It has been estimated that over 9% of the US population had diabetes in 2012. This corresponds to about 29.1 million people.' 
Which type of diabetes is most common?,"'Type 1 diabetes is much less common and affects about 1.25 million people. It is further estimated that of the 29.1 million people affected with diabetes, about 8.1 million people are undiagnosed, meaning that they have diabetes but are not aware of it. There has been an increase in the number of Americans with ''prediabetes''. In 2010, 79 million people were estimated to have prediabetes. In 2012, this number was 86 million.' "
Are the same tests used to diagnose both types?,"'A fasting blood sugar measurement can be used to diagnose any type of diabetes. This test measures the level of sugar (glucose) in the bloodstream in the morning before eating breakfast. Normal fasting plasma glucose levels are less than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Fasting plasma glucose levels of more than 126 mg/dl on two or more tests on different days indicate diabetes. A random (non-fasting) blood glucose test can also be used to diagnose diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dl or higher indicates diabetes.''Another test that is often used is a blood test to measure levels of glycated ''hemoglobin'' (''hemoglobin A1c''). This test provides a measure of the average levels of blood glucose over the past 3 months. Other names for the A1C test are HbA1C and glycosylated ''hemoglobin'' test.''Tests to identify the abnormal antibodies produced by the immune system are used to diagnose type 1 diabetes. Some of the antibodies seen in type 1 diabetes include anti-islet cell antibodies, anti-insulin antibodies and anti-glutamic decarboxylase antibodies.' "
How do the treatments for type 1 and type 2 diabetes differ?,"'Type 1 treatment'': Insulin is the treatment of choice for type 1 diabetes, because the body responds appropriately to insulin and the problem is a lack of insulin production by the pancreas.''Type 2 treatment:'' Treatment for type 2 is more complicated due to the fact that the body may produce enough insulin but not be able to use this insulin effectively. For many people with ''prediabetes'' or early stage type 2, lifestyle modifications may be sufficient to control the problem. These can include regular physical activity, ''weight loss'', and following a healthy ''diet'' plan to avoid becoming ''obese''.''When lifestyle changes are not enough to control blood sugar levels in people with type 2, medications may be added. There are a great many types, or classes, of ''drugs'' that are used to treat this form of the disease, and there are too many to list. These ''drugs'' often are used in combination. The classes of drugs include:'  Sulfonylureas, for example, glyburide (DiaBeta) and glipizide (Glucotrol), stimulate the beta cells of the pancreas to produce more insulin. Biguanides, for example, metformin (Glucophage), decrease glucose production by the liver. Meglitinides, for example, repaglinide (Prandin) and Nateglinide (Starlix), is a drug class that stimulates insulin production.  Thiazolidinediones, for example, pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone (Avandia), lead to more effective insulin action in fat and muscle tissues, and also decrease glucose production in the liver DPP-IV inhibitors, for example, sitagliptin (Januvia) and linagliptin (Tradjenta), is a newer class of drugs that work by preventing the breakdown of a naturally occurring compound in the body, GLP-1, that reduces blood glucose levels in the body. SGLT2 inhibitors, for example, canagliflozin (Invokana) and dapagliflozin (Farxiga), cause excess glucose to be excreted in the urine. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, for example, acarbose (Precose), act by blocking or slowing the breakdown of starches and sugars after eating. Bile acid sequestrants lower blood cholesterol and typically reduce blood sugar in the process."
Are the complications of both types of diabetes the same?,"'Long-term complications of either type are related to damage to blood vessels. These complications generally are referred to as small vessel disease, involving the eyes, kidneys and nerves and large vessel disease, involving the ''heart'' and blood vessels. For example, ''diabetic neuropathy'' refers to damage to the nerves that can cause numbness and tingling, among other symptoms. Any type of diabetes accelerates blood vessel damage due to ''hardening of the arteries'' (''atherosclerosis''), leading to coronary ''heart disease'' (''angina'' or ''heart attack''), ''strokes'', and ''pain'' in the lower extremities because of lack of blood supply (''claudication'').' Severely elevated blood sugar levels due to an actual lack of insulin or insufficient action of insulin. This leads to conditions called diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma, which can be life-threatening. Abnormally low blood sugar levels due to too much insulin or other glucose-lowering medications."
Can either type of diabetes be prevented?,"'There is no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes, and for some people, it might not be possible to prevent the development of type 2. For others, maintaining a healthy weight, getting regular ''exercise'', and a healthy, balanced ''diet'' may help prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes and thus preserve health.' "
What's the life expectancy for a person with either type of diabetes?,"""This depends upon the individual, including any other health conditions that are present and whether complications of diabetes have developed. Because of the development of complications, studies have shown that on average, those with type 1 diabetes have a life expectancy that is still 12 years below the average. Other studies have showed that type 2 diabetes also reduces average life expectancy. It's important to remember that these are only averages based upon people who have had diabetes in the past and may be affected by including people who do not receive medical care or who have poor control over their diabetes. Advances in modern treatments are likely to reduce these gaps, and taking steps to make sure your diabetes is well controlled and leading a healthy lifestyle can further reduce the risk of death from complications."" "
What is type 2 diabetes?,"'Type 2 diabetes'"" is the most common type of diabetes. It is a chronic condition in which blood glucose (sugar) can no longer be regulated. There are two reasons for this. First, the cells of the body become resistant to insulin (insulin resistant). Insulin works like a key to let glucose (blood sugar) move out of the blood and into the cells where it is used as fuel for energy. When the cells become insulin resistant, moving sugar into the cells requires more and more insulin, and too much sugar stays in the blood. Over time, if the cells require more and more insulin, the pancreas can't make enough insulin to keep up and begins to fail."" "
What are the signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes?,"'This type of diabetes develops gradually, over years, so the signs and symptoms can seem subtle, and you might think it is something you ""just have to live with."" If you are overweight or ''obese'', this is the major symptom, but not everyone will be overweight. In fact, ''weight loss'' can be a symptom.''Other symptoms and signs include:'   Fatigue Frequent urination Excess thirst Blurry or cloudy vision Wounds that won't heal Tingling or numbness in the feet Erectile dysfunction (ED) Dark skin under the armpits and around the groin"
What are the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)?,"'Type 2 diabetes is a condition of blood sugar dysregulation. In general blood sugar is too high, but it also can be too low. This can happen if you take your ''diabetes medications'' then skip a meal. Blood sugar also can rise very quickly after a high ''glycemic index'' meal, and then fall a few hours later, plummeting into hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). The signs and ''symptoms of hypoglycemia'' can include' Feeling dizzy or light-headed Difficulty concentrating or making decisions Feeling sweaty or clammy Vision changes, like blurring or narrowing of the visual field Feeling physically weak Feeling sleepy Feeling irritable"
What are the signs and symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia)?,"'Hyperglycemia, or ''high blood sugar'', is common in type 2 diabetes. Its signs and symptoms can be either acute (short in duration) or chronic (last over a long period of time).' Feeling tired Feeling vision is blurry or foggy Frequent urination Feeling very thirsty Darkening skin under armpits, neck, thighs Fungal infections on the skin like ringworm or toenail fungus Weight gain Difficulty with sexual function Numbness, tingling, or burning sensations in the feet"
What causes type 2 diabetes? Can it be reversed?,"'Type 2 diabetes can be reversed with diligent attention to changing lifestyle behaviors. Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of genetics and unhealthy lifestyle habits.'  Some ethnic groups have a higher inherited incidence of it. African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders are all at increased risk. Other causes include unhealthy lifestyle habits, for example, if you:Eat too much sugar and carbohydratesEat or drink foods with artificial sweetenersDon't get enough exerciseAre under chronic, high stress Eat too much sugar and carbohydrates Eat or drink foods with artificial sweeteners Don't get enough exercise Are under chronic, high stress"
What is the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes?," If you have type 2, you can lower high blood sugar levels with diet, exercise, and oral drugs that either make the body more sensitive to insulin or help the pancreas release more insulin. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas cannot make any insulin, and people have to depend on insulin injections to lower blood sugar. Over time, people with type 2 also can require insulin. This happens when the pancreas ""wears out."""
Who gets type 2 diabetes (risk factors)?,"'Risk factors for type 2 diabetes are:''Lifestyle habits can contribute to a person developing the disease, for example:' Age (being over age 45) A family history of diabetes Being of a race or ethnic group with a genetic predisposition for this type of diabetes Being overweight Having had prediabetes or gestational diabetes Having other metabolic syndrome conditions such as high blood pressure, low HDL or ""good"" cholesterol, or high triglycerides If you are overweight or obese If you are sedentary (you don't exercise and are not physically active) If you watch more than 2 hours of TV per day If you drink artificially sweetened or sugar sweetened products. These products increase your risk by 26%-67%. Economic stress. People who live in the lowest-income circumstances have 2 1/2 times greater risk of developing the disease."
Is there a blood test to diagnose type 2 diabetes?,"'Yes, there is a blood test to diagnose this disease. The blood is tested for glucose, and if it is greater than 125 fasting, or more than 200 when randomly tested, the diagnosis is diabetes. If the fasting blood sugar is between 100-125, the person has a diagnosis of prediabetes.''Tests also can measure average blood sugar over time. A ''hemoglobin A1c'' (HbA1c) test greater than 6.5% indicates the diagnosis of the disease. Prediabetes is diagnosed with an HbA1c of 5.7% - 6.4%.' "
What is the treatment for type 2 diabetes?,"'Treatment for this type of diabetes can include:''Not all people with diabetes need drug therapy. A healthy eating plan and exercise alone can be enough if the person makes significant lifestyle changes. Other signs, symptoms, and complications also may need treatment. For example, nutritional deficiencies should be corrected, heart or kidney disease may need to be treated, and vision must be checked for eye problems like ''diabetic retinopathy''.' Diabetic eating plan Exercise Weight loss Oral drugs Injectable drugs Treating other problems like stress or sleep apnea Dietary supplements"
Is there a type 2 diabetes diet plan?,"'If you have this type of diabetes, the foods you eat should have a low-glycemic load (index) -- foods higher in ''fiber'', protein, or ''fats'' -- like vegetables and good quality protein such as fish, chicken, beans, and lentils. From that base, add other types of nutritious foods like fruit, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and nuts.''Avoid foods with a high glycemic index (foods that raise blood sugar too quickly) such as processed foods, and foods high in carbohydrates, sugars, or animal fat. Examples of foods to avoid include:''A good rule of thumb is to avoid white foods (except for cauliflower!).'   Desserts Sweets Pastries Breads Chips Crackers Pasta"
Can exercise help manage type 2 diabetes?,"'Exercise is very important if you have this health condition. Exercise makes cells more insulin sensitive, pulling glucose out of the blood. This brings down blood sugar, and more importantly, gives you better energy because the glucose is being transferred to the cells. Any type of exercise will do this, but you gain extra benefit when the activity helps build muscle, such as weight training or using resistance bands. The ''benefits of exercise'' on blood sugar last about 48-72 hours, so it is important for you to be physically active almost every day.' "
What medications treat type 2 diabetes?,"'There are different types of ''diabetes drugs''. They work in different ways to either stop the ''liver'"" from making glucose, make the pancreas release more insulin, or block glucose from being absorbed. Insulin replaces the natural insulin when the pancreas can't make it any longer.""'Metformin (Glucophage, Glucophage XR, ''Glumetza'', ''Fortamet'', ''Riomet'') belongs to a class of drugs called biguanides. Metformin is first-line therapy for most type 2 diabetics. It works to stop the liver from making excess glucose, and has a low risk of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia, or very low blood sugar can cause symptoms such as ''sweating'', nervousness, heart ''palpitations'', ''weakness'', intense hunger, trembling, and problems speaking. Many patients lose some weight taking metformin, which is also helpful for blood sugar control.''Sulfonureas and meglitinides are classes of drugs also prescribed for treatment. These drugs cause the pancreas to release more insulin. Since the pancreas can only work so hard, these drugs have a limited duration of usefulness.''The sulfonureas include:''The meglitinides include:''Canagliflozin'' (''Invokana'') and ''dapagliflozin'' (''Farxiga'') are oral medications prescribed to treat type 2 diabetics. These drugs belong to the drug class referred to as sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. These drugs work by stopping the absorption of glucose in the kidneys, enabling some of it to be urinated out.''There are other oral and injectable drugs for patients with type 2 diabetics such as:'""For people who want to avoid drugs, taking an aggressive approach to healthy eating plan and lifestyle change is an option. It isn't easy, but if someone is very committed and motivated, lifestyle changes can be enough to maintain a healthy blood sugar level and to ""'lose weight''.

Do people with type 2 diabetes have to take insulin?,"'Insulin is only recommended for individuals with type 2 diabetes when they have not been able to get blood sugars low enough to prevent complications through other means. To avoid insulin, those with this health condition should work very hard to follow a healthy eating plan that includes a lot of vegetables and lean proteins, exercise every day, and keep stress in perspective. They also should take their oral drugs regularly. It can be difficult to follow these recommendations and the help of your doctor, nutritionist, diabetes educator, health coach, or integrative medicine practitioner may be helpful. If you want to avoid taking medicine, work with health professionals who are knowledgeable about lifestyle medicine and can help you understand how to fit the changes into your life.' "
What if I have type 2 diabetes and become pregnant?,"'If you are a diabetic and are ''pregnant'' you can have a normal, healthy ''pregnancy'', but you need to take extra steps to avoid gaining excess weight and high blood sugars. Lifestyle habits (eating primarily vegetables and lean protein and exercising every day) will prevent problems during pregnancy. If you are a diabetic and become pregnant, monitor your blood sugar levels often. Talk with your doctor about exploring additional health care professionals, for example, a nutritionist, health coach, or naturopathic doctor about a healthy eating plan. If your blood sugar gets out of control you may:' Have a large baby Get preeclampsia Have a premature birth"
What are the complications of type 2 diabetes?,"'If blood sugar is not controlled over time, complications can develop. These include:''If you have diabetes, you have a higher risk of ''heart disease'' and ''heart attack''.

Can type 2 diabetes be prevented?,"'A healthy lifestyle can prevent almost all cases of type 2 diabetes. A large research study called the ''Diabetes Prevention'' Program, found that people who made intensive lifestyle changes including diet and exercise reduced their risk of developing diabetes by 58%. Those over 60 years old seemed to experience extra benefit; they reduced their risk by 71%. In comparison, people who were given the drug metformin for diabetes ''prevention'' only reduced their risk by 31%.' "
What is the prognosis and life expectancy for someone with type 2 diabetes?,"'Some research shows that people with type 2 diabetes may die 10 years earlier than those without diabetes. Most people with the disease die of secondary complications of it, for example ''kidney failure'' or ''heart disease''. However, with good blood sugar control and healthy lifestyle choices, complications can be prevented.' "

In contrast, ''type 1 diabetes'' is most often diagnosed in young people.''Genetics plays a role in the development of ''type 2 diabetes'', and having a family history and close relatives with the condition increases your risk; however, there are other risk factors, with ''obesity'' being the most significant. There is a direct relationship between the degree of ''obesity'' and the risk of developing ''type 2 diabetes'' for both children and adults. It has been estimated that the risk of developing ''type 2 diabetes'' doubles for every 20% increase over desirable body weight.' "
What are the differences between the causes of type 1 and type 2?,"'Type 1 diabetes'' causes''Type 1 diabetes'"" is believed to be due to an autoimmune process, in which the body's immune system mistakenly targets its own tissues (islet cells in the pancreas). In people with ""'type 1 diabetes'', the beta cells of the pancreas that are responsible for insulin production are attacked by the misdirected immune system. This tendency for the immune system to destroy the beta cells of the pancreas is likely to be, at least in part, genetically ''inherited'', although the exact reasons that this process happens are not fully understood.''Exposure to certain viral infections (''mumps'' and Coxsackie ''viruses'') or other environmental toxins have been suggested as possible reasons why the abnormal antibody responses develop that cause damage to the pancreas cells.''The primary problem in type 2 ''diabetes'"" is the inability of the body's cells to use insulin properly and efficiently, leading to ""'hyperglycemia'' (''high blood sugar'') and ''diabetes''. This problem affects mostly the cells of muscle and fat tissues and results in a condition known as ''insulin resistance''. In type 2 diabetes, there also is a steady decline of beta cells that worsens the process of elevated blood sugars. In the beginning, if someone is resistant to insulin, the body can at least partially increase the production of insulin enough to overcome the level of resistance. Over time, if production decreases and enough insulin cannot be released, blood ''sugar'' levels rise. In many cases, this actually means the pancreas produces larger than normal quantities of insulin, but the body is not able to use it effectively. A major feature of type 2 diabetes is a lack of sensitivity to insulin by the cells of the body (particularly fat and muscle cells).''Both diabetes type 1 and diabetes type 2, require good control over their ''diet'' by eating foods that help regulate blood ''sugar'', ''exercise'', and in most patients, medical treatments to allow the patient to remain in good health.' "
What are the differences between the signs and symptoms of type 1 vs. type 2 diabetes?,"'Signs and ''symptoms of diabetes'', whether type 1 or type 2, do not differ.'   Early diabetes may not produce any symptoms at all. When symptoms do occur, the age of onset is typically different, with type 1 diabetes being diagnosed most often in younger people (in a child, for example), while type 2 diabetes is diagnosed more commonly in adults. However, this is not always the case. The increasing incidence of obesity among children and adolescents has caused a rise in the development of type 2 diabetes in young people. Further, some adults with diabetes may be diagnosed with a form of late-onset type 1 diabetes."
How are the signs and symptoms similar?,"'There isn\'t a difference between the symptoms of either disease. The ""classic"" symptoms are the same for both diabetes type 1 and type 2:''For both type 1 and type 2, early symptoms of untreated diabetes arise due to elevated blood sugar levels and the presence of glucose in the urine. High amounts of glucose in the urine can cause increased urine output and ''dehydration''. ''Dehydration'', in turn, causes increased ''thirst''.''A lack of insulin or an inability of insulin to work properly affects protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism. Insulin normally encourages the storage of fat and protein, so when there is inadequate insulin or poorly functioning insulin, this eventually leads to ''weight loss'' despite an increase in appetite.''Some untreated diabetes patients also experience generalized symptoms like ''fatigue'', ''nausea'', and ''vomiting''. People with diabetes are also at risk for infections of the bladder, skin, and vaginal areas. Changes in blood glucose levels can lead to ''blurred vision''. When blood sugar levels are extremely high, lethargy and ''coma'' can result.' Increased urine output (polyuria) Increased thirst (polydipsia) Increased hunger (Polyphagia ) Unexplained weight loss"
How many people have diabetes?,'It has been estimated that over 9% of the US population had diabetes in 2012. This corresponds to about 29.1 million people.' 
Which type of diabetes is most common?,"'Type 1 diabetes is much less common and affects about 1.25 million people. It is further estimated that of the 29.1 million people affected with diabetes, about 8.1 million people are undiagnosed, meaning that they have diabetes but are not aware of it. There has been an increase in the number of Americans with ''prediabetes''. In 2010, 79 million people were estimated to have prediabetes. In 2012, this number was 86 million.' "
Are the same tests used to diagnose both types?,"'A fasting blood sugar measurement can be used to diagnose any type of diabetes. This test measures the level of sugar (glucose) in the bloodstream in the morning before eating breakfast. Normal fasting plasma glucose levels are less than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Fasting plasma glucose levels of more than 126 mg/dl on two or more tests on different days indicate diabetes. A random (non-fasting) blood glucose test can also be used to diagnose diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dl or higher indicates diabetes.''Another test that is often used is a blood test to measure levels of glycated ''hemoglobin'' (''hemoglobin A1c''). This test provides a measure of the average levels of blood glucose over the past 3 months. Other names for the A1C test are HbA1C and glycosylated ''hemoglobin'' test.''Tests to identify the abnormal antibodies produced by the immune system are used to diagnose type 1 diabetes. Some of the antibodies seen in type 1 diabetes include anti-islet cell antibodies, anti-insulin antibodies and anti-glutamic decarboxylase antibodies.' "
How do the treatments for type 1 and type 2 diabetes differ?,"'Type 1 treatment'': Insulin is the treatment of choice for type 1 diabetes, because the body responds appropriately to insulin and the problem is a lack of insulin production by the pancreas.''Type 2 treatment:'' Treatment for type 2 is more complicated due to the fact that the body may produce enough insulin but not be able to use this insulin effectively. For many people with ''prediabetes'' or early stage type 2, lifestyle modifications may be sufficient to control the problem. These can include regular physical activity, ''weight loss'', and following a healthy ''diet'' plan to avoid becoming ''obese''.''When lifestyle changes are not enough to control blood sugar levels in people with type 2, medications may be added. There are a great many types, or classes, of ''drugs'' that are used to treat this form of the disease, and there are too many to list. These ''drugs'' often are used in combination. The classes of drugs include:'  Sulfonylureas, for example, glyburide (DiaBeta) and glipizide (Glucotrol), stimulate the beta cells of the pancreas to produce more insulin. Biguanides, for example, metformin (Glucophage), decrease glucose production by the liver. Meglitinides, for example, repaglinide (Prandin) and Nateglinide (Starlix), is a drug class that stimulates insulin production.  Thiazolidinediones, for example, pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone (Avandia), lead to more effective insulin action in fat and muscle tissues, and also decrease glucose production in the liver DPP-IV inhibitors, for example, sitagliptin (Januvia) and linagliptin (Tradjenta), is a newer class of drugs that work by preventing the breakdown of a naturally occurring compound in the body, GLP-1, that reduces blood glucose levels in the body. SGLT2 inhibitors, for example, canagliflozin (Invokana) and dapagliflozin (Farxiga), cause excess glucose to be excreted in the urine. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, for example, acarbose (Precose), act by blocking or slowing the breakdown of starches and sugars after eating. Bile acid sequestrants lower blood cholesterol and typically reduce blood sugar in the process."
Are the complications of both types of diabetes the same?,"'Long-term complications of either type are related to damage to blood vessels. These complications generally are referred to as small vessel disease, involving the eyes, kidneys and nerves and large vessel disease, involving the ''heart'' and blood vessels. For example, ''diabetic neuropathy'' refers to damage to the nerves that can cause numbness and tingling, among other symptoms. Any type of diabetes accelerates blood vessel damage due to ''hardening of the arteries'' (''atherosclerosis''), leading to coronary ''heart disease'' (''angina'' or ''heart attack''), ''strokes'', and ''pain'' in the lower extremities because of lack of blood supply (''claudication'').' Severely elevated blood sugar levels due to an actual lack of insulin or insufficient action of insulin. This leads to conditions called diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma, which can be life-threatening. Abnormally low blood sugar levels due to too much insulin or other glucose-lowering medications."
Can either type of diabetes be prevented?,"'There is no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes, and for some people, it might not be possible to prevent the development of type 2. For others, maintaining a healthy weight, getting regular ''exercise'', and a healthy, balanced ''diet'' may help prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes and thus preserve health.' "
What's the life expectancy for a person with either type of diabetes?,"""This depends upon the individual, including any other health conditions that are present and whether complications of diabetes have developed. Because of the development of complications, studies have shown that on average, those with type 1 diabetes have a life expectancy that is still 12 years below the average. Other studies have showed that type 2 diabetes also reduces average life expectancy. It's important to remember that these are only averages based upon people who have had diabetes in the past and may be affected by including people who do not receive medical care or who have poor control over their diabetes. Advances in modern treatments are likely to reduce these gaps, and taking steps to make sure your diabetes is well controlled and leading a healthy lifestyle can further reduce the risk of death from complications."" "
What are the types of hernia?,"'The following are some of the most common ''hernia'' types:' Epigastric hernia: An epigastric hernia occurs in the epigastric region of the abdomen, which is a centrally located area above the belly button and just below the ribcage. Patients present with a feeling of increased pressure on the abdominal wall, especially while coughing, laughing, or passing stools. They may also have pain or tenderness in and around the epigastric region. Femoral hernia: A femoral hernia occurs when body tissue pushes through a weak point in the groin/inner thigh. It presents as a small- to medium-sized lump in the groin. Femoral hernias occur more commonly in women than in men. Important blood vessels, the femoral artery, and femoral vein lie close to the hernia, raising medical concerns. The hernia could compress the blood vessels and reduce blood flow to and from the leg. Hence, early surgical intervention is required. Hiatal hernia: A hiatal hernia occurs when part of the upper portion of the stomach bulges through a weak point in the diaphragm, a thin muscle that separates the lungs from the abdominal organs. Patients typically present with acid reflux and the severity may vary with the type of hiatal hernia. There are four types of Hiatal hernias, type I to IV, based on where they are located. Type I is the most common (95%). In type I, the stomach remains in anatomical position but not at the part where the esophagus meets the stomach slides above the diaphragm. This can usually be managed conservatively. Incisional hernia: An incisional hernia usually occurs after surgery, typically a stomach surgery, involving an incision over the middle of the stomach, such as cesarean delivery (C section). If the surgical wound does not heal properly or creates a weak point, it can lead to incisional hernia. Sometimes an incisional hernia is called a ventral hernia. Any type pf hernia that occurs in the midline of the stomach is called a ventral hernia, irrespective of the cause. Hence, not all ventral hernias are incisional hernias. Inguinal hernia: An inguinal hernia occurs when a part of the intestine or fat around the intestine bulges through a weak point in the lower abdominal wall. Sometimes lower abdominal organs like parts of the female reproductive organs can also bulge through the weak point. Inguinal hernias commonly present on the right side. They are more common in men than in women. In men, an inguinal hernia can cause a bulge in the groin and scrotum. Sometimes, it may be difficult to distinguish between a femoral and inguinal hernia. Umbilical hernia: An umbilical hernia occurs when body tissues bulge through an area of weakness in the umbilicus (belly button area). This hernia presents with a visible bulge in or around the umbilicus that usually worsens while coughing or straining during a bowel movement. An umbilical hernia can also occur in infants (babies)."
What is a hernia?,"'A\xa0hernia appears when a part of tissue or organ bulges through a weak point in the body. There are various types of hernia occurring in different parts of the body. The signs, symptoms, and complications vary with each type of hernia and the severity of the hernia.' "
Do hernias require treatment?,"'Hernias may be asymptomatic in the initial stages. However, hernias can become strangulated and cause tissue death.' A strangulated hernia is a medical emergency because the part of the body tissue or organ bulging is cut off from its blood supply. Hernias do not usually resolve on their own. Surgical intervention is required for a complete cure. In the initial stages, doctors may advise observation and follow-up, but surgery is recommended when the hernia is noticeable to prevent worsening or strangulation."
When to see a doctor?,"'It is advised to seek immediate medical attention in the presence of the following symptoms:' Fever Sudden and severe pain at the hernia site Warmth, tenderness, and change in color at the hernia site  Nausea Vomiting Issue with passing gas Constipation "
Can hernias be prevented?,"'Most types of hernia can’t be prevented. The following tips may help prevent hernias in some cases:' Maintaining a healthy body weight, which decreases abdominal wall pressure. Avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol. Avoiding heavy lifting and straining while exercising. Correcting chronic constipation to prevent straining during bowel movements. Eating a high-fiber diet and drinking plenty of fluids can help improve constipation, if not, seeking medical attention is required. Seeking medical attention to treat chronic cough."
What are the types of penis disorders?,"'Penis disorders'' may affect men’s sexual life, ''fertility'' and overall well-being. Some are minor and don’t cause many issues. However, some may lead to serious emergencies. The most common penis disorders are as follows''There are other problems too such as premature or delayed release of semen (ejaculation), semen entering the bladder instead of emerging through the penis (retrograde ejaculation), penile ''fracture'', ''birth defects'' in which the urinary opening is not located at the tip of the penis (hypospadias), etc.' Balanitis (swelling, redness and infection of the head of the penis seen in uncircumcised men) Phimosis (tight foreskin of the penis) Paraphimosis (the foreskin once retracted gets stuck behind the head and cannot return) Priapism (a persistent, often painful erection that does not go away or lasts for more than four hours) Peyronie’s disease (bending of the penis during an erection due to a hard lump or plaque) Cancer of the penis  Erectile dysfunction (difficult to get or keep an erection)"

What are the types of strokes?,"'There are five main types of ''strokes'', and the causes and clinical presentation of each of them vary:' Ischemic stroke Hemorrhagic stroke Transient ischemic attack (Ministroke) Brain stem stroke Cryptogenic stroke (stroke of unknown cause)"
What is a stroke?,"'A stroke, also called ''cerebrovascular accident'' (CVA), occurs when the blood supply is cut off or reduced to a part of the brain. This causes a decrease in oxygenation of the brain and prevents the brain tissue from receiving sufficient ''nutrition''. Eventually, brain cells begin to die. This entire process takes place within a few minutes. A stroke is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention. Quick diagnosis and treatment can reduce ''brain damage'', disabilities, and other complications that can be permanent.' "
Ischemic stroke,"'This is the most common type of a stroke (87% of all strokes). An ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain gets blocked. This leads to decreased oxygenation (ischemia) of the part of the brain supplied by that blood vessel.''Causes of an ischemic stroke:''Symptoms of an ischemic stroke:''The symptoms depend on the parts of the brain affected:' Atherosclerosis (fatty substance/cholesterol [plaque] gets collected in your arteries and narrows them) A blood clot in the blood vessels that supply blood to the brain Heart attack Defects of the heart valves  Arrhythmia (Irregular heart rhythm) Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, typically on one side of the body Confusion Slurring of speech Giddiness Loss of balance or coordination Difficulty walking Blurring of vision, diplopia (double vision), or loss of vision "
Transient ischemic attack or a ministroke,"'Transient ischemic attack'' (''TIA'') occurs when there is a temporary blockage in blood flow to the brain. The symptoms usually disappear within 24 hours. TIA indicates an increased risk of an ischemic stroke.'""Don't take chances if you or someone you know has any symptoms that seem like a stroke. Get medical help in a hurry.""'Causes and risk factors for TIA:''TIA can occur because the vessels that bring blood to the brain become narrow or a ''blood clot'' in the vessel.''Factors that can increase the risk of TIA include:''Symptoms of TIA:''The symptoms are usually similar to those of an ischemic stroke, but they disappear within a day:' Age High blood pressure High cholesterol Diabetes Heart disease Obesity Smoking Family history of strokes Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, typically on one side of the body Confusion Slurring of speech Giddiness Loss of balance or coordination Difficulty walking Blurring of vision, diplopia (double vision) or loss of vision  Severe headaches"
Hemorrhagic stroke,"'This occurs when there is bleeding within the brain, causing damage to the brain tissues.\xa0Bleeding can occur in the space between the brain and skull bone (subarachnoid hemorrhage) or inside the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage).''Causes and risk factors for a hemorrhagic stroke:''Symptoms of a hemorrhagic stroke:''Hemorrhagic ''stroke symptoms'' usually appear slowly and increase gradually over minutes or a few hours, although subarachnoid hemorrhage may come on suddenly.

It is recommended that treatment begins within 4.5 hours."
What is typhoid fever? What is the history of typhoid fever?,"'Typhoid fever is an acute infectious illness associated with fever that is most often caused by the ''Salmonella typhi'' bacteria. ''Salmonella paratyphi'', a related bacterium that usually leads to a less severe illness, can also cause typhoid fever. The feces of human carriers of the bacteria may contaminate water or food, and the illness then spreads to other people in the area. Typhoid fever is rare in industrial countries but continues to be a significant public health issue in developing countries.''The incidence of typhoid fever in the United States has decreased since the early 1900s. In 2014, medical professionals reported approximately 300 cases to the CDC, mostly in people who recently traveled to endemic areas. This is in comparison to the 1920s, when there were over 35,000 reported cases in the U.S., with a 20% fatality rate.''In the early 1900s, a healthy carrier called Typhoid Mary (her real name was Mary Mallon) caused several outbreaks in the New York City area; she was infected, worked as a cook, and consequently spread the disease to others.''A recent outbreak affected refugees in Manus Island, Papua New Guinea.''The decrease in cases in the United States is the result of improved environmental sanitation, vaccination, and treatment with antibiotics. Mexico and South America are the most common areas for U.S. citizens to contract typhoid fever. India, Pakistan, and Egypt are also known high-risk areas for developing this disease. Worldwide, typhoid fever affects more than 21 million people annually, with over 200,000 patients dying of the disease.''If traveling to endemic areas, you should consult with your health care professional and discuss if you should receive vaccination for typhoid fever.'  "
How do patients get typhoid fever?,"'People contract typhoid fever when they ingestion the bacteria in contaminated food or water. Patients with acute illness can contaminate the surrounding water supply through ''stool'', which contains a high concentration of the bacteria. Contamination of the water supply can taint the food supply. About 3%-5% of patients become carriers of the bacteria after the acute illness. Some patients suffer a very mild illness that goes unrecognized. These patients can become long-term carriers of the bacteria. The bacteria multiply in the gallbladder, bile ducts, or ''liver'' and passes into the bowel. The bacteria can survive for weeks in water or dried sewage. These chronic carriers may have no symptoms and can be the source of new outbreaks of typhoid fever for many years.' "
What causes typhoid fever? How do health care professionals diagnose typhoid fever?,"'After the ingestion of contaminated food or water, the ''Salmonella'' bacteria invade the small intestine and enter the bloodstream temporarily. White blood cells carry the bacteria to the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The bacteria then multiply in the cells of these organs and reenter the bloodstream. Patients develop symptoms, including fever, when the organism reenters the bloodstream. Bacteria invade the gallbladder, biliary system, and the lymphatic tissue of the bowel. Here, they multiply in high numbers. The bacteria pass into the intestinal tract and can be identified for diagnosis in cultures from the stool tested in the laboratory. Stool cultures are sensitive in the early and late stages of the disease, but it may be necessary to perform blood cultures to make a definitive diagnosis.' "
What are the signs and symptoms of typhoid fever?,"'The incubation period is usually 1-2 weeks, and the duration of the illness is about 4-6 weeks. The patient experiences''People with typhoid fever usually have a sustained fever as high as 103 F-104 F (39 C-40 C).''Chest congestion'' develops in many patients, and ''abdominal pain'' and discomfort are common. The fever becomes constant. Improvement occurs in the third and fourth week in those without complications. About 10% of patients have recurrent symptoms (relapse) after feeling better for 1-2 weeks. Relapses are actually more common in individuals treated with antibiotics.'   poor appetite; abdominal pain and peritonitis; headaches; generalized aches and pains and weakness; high fever, often up to 104 F; lethargy (usually only if untreated); intestinal bleeding or perforation (after 2-3 weeks of the disease); cough; diarrhea; or constipation."
"What is the treatment for typhoid fever, and what is the prognosis?","'Antibiotics that kill the ''Salmonella'' bacteria treat typhoid fever. Prior to the use of antibiotics and intravenous fluids, the fatality rate was 20%. Death occurred from overwhelming infection, ''pneumonia'', intestinal bleeding, or intestinal perforation. Antibiotics and supportive care have reduced the mortality rate to 1%-2%. With appropriate antibiotic therapy, there is usually improvement within one to two days and recovery within 7 to 10 days.''Several antibiotics are effective for the treatment of typhoid fever. ''Chloramphenicol'' was the original drug of choice for many years. Because of rare serious side effects, other effective antibiotics have replaced chloramphenicol. The choice of antibiotics needs to be guided by identifying the geographic region where the organism was acquired and the results of cultures once available. (Certain ''strains'' from South America show a significant resistance to some antibiotics.) ''Ciprofloxacin'' (''Cipro'') is the most frequently used drug in the U.S. for nonpregnant patients. Ceftriaxone (Rocephin), an intramuscular injection medication, is an alternative for ''pregnant'' patients. ''Ampicillin'' (Omnipen, Polycillin, Principen) and ''trimethoprim'' (''Bactrim'', ''Septra'') are frequently prescribed antibiotics although resistance has been reported in recent years.''Medical professionals have reported multi-''drug resistance'' and use cultures to guide treatment. If relapses occur, patients are retreated with antibiotics.''Prolonged antibiotics can treat the carrier state, which occurs in 3%-5% of those infected. Often, removal of the gallbladder, the site of chronic infection, will cure the carrier state.' "
What specialists treats typhoid fever?,"'Your primary care doctor can diagnose and treat typhoid fever. Because the disease is very rare in the United States, an infectious disease specialist often assists in the care of the patient with typhoid fever, as well.' "
Is typhoid fever contagious?,"'Typhoid fever is very ''contagious'' and contracted by the ingestion of the bacteria in contaminated food or water. Patients with acute illness can contaminate the surrounding water supply through infected stool, which contains a high concentration of the bacteria. It does not spread through the air (by ''cough'') or by touching (assuming there is no fecal exchange or first bacterial ingestion).' "
Is it possible to prevent typhoid fever?,"'For those traveling to high-risk areas, typhoid ''vaccines'' are now available. The routine administration of the vaccine is usually not recommended in the U.S. There are two forms of the vaccine available, an oral and an injectable form. People need to complete the vaccination at least 1-2 weeks (depending on the type of vaccine) prior to travel and, depending on the type of vaccine. The vaccine only protects from 2 to 5 years. The oral vaccine is contraindicated in patients with ''depressed'' immune systems. Details of the vaccination and the choice of vaccine should be discussed with a health care professional.' "
What is typhus? Are there different types of typhus?,"'Typhus is a disease caused by bacteria (mainly ''Rickettsia typhi'' or ''R. prowazekii''). There are two major types of typhus: endemic (or murine typhus) and epidemic typhus -- ''bacterial infections'' cause both. The bacteria are small and very difficult to cultivate. Originally, they were thought to be ''viruses''. The disease occurs after bacteria (''Rickettsia'') transfer to humans, usually by vectors such as fleas or lice that have acquired the bacteria from animals such as rats, cats, opossums, raccoons, and other animals. Endemic typhus (mainly caused by ''R. typhi'') is also termed murine typhus and ""jail fever."" ""Endemic typhus"" also means that an area or region has an animal population (usually mice, rats, or squirrels) that has members of its population continually infected with ''R. typhi'' that through flea vectors can incidentally infect humans. Epidemic typhus (caused by ''R. prowazekii'') is the more severe form of typhus. It has also been termed recrudescent or sporadic typhus. ""Epidemic typhus"" also means that a few animals, (usually rats) via lice vectors, can incidentally infect large numbers of humans quickly when certain environmental conditions are present (''poor hygiene'', crowded human living conditions) with the more pathogenic ''R. prowazekii''. Epidemic typhus has a milder form termed Brill-Zinsser disease, which occurs when ''R. prowazekii'' bacteria reactivate in a person previously infected with epidemic typhus.''There is some ''confusion'' surrounding the term ""typhus."" Many people equate typhus with typhoid (''typhoid fever''), which is incorrect. There is confusion for multiple reasons. Both diseases have in common the symptom of high fever, and the major species of ''Rickettsia'' that causes endemic typhus is still termed ""typhi."" However, the causes, transmission, pathology, and treatment of these diseases are quite different. ''Salmonella'' species cause typhoid fever, and this is unrelated to ''Rickettsia''. Additionally confusing is the term ''scrub typhus'', which refers to a related but different disease caused by the cellular parasite ''Orientia tsutsugamushi''. This disease is related to typhus and endemic to South America and some parts of Africa but is caused by a different genus and species of bacteria and is transmitted by a different vector (mites). The aim of this article is to inform the reader about the two major worldwide variations of typhus, endemic and the more severe epidemic typhus.' "
What is the history of typhus?,"'One of the first written descriptions of the disease (probably of epidemic typhus) describing ''rash'', sores, delirium, and about 17,000 deaths of Spanish troops was during the siege of Granada in 1489. Further descriptions over time termed the disease gaol or jail fever. In 1759, English authorities estimated about 25% of all prisoners in England died of gaol fever per year. In 1760, the disease was named typhus, from the Greek ''smoke'' or ''stupor'"" because of the symptom of delirium that can develop. Many typhus epidemics raged throughout Europe for several centuries and were often related to poor living conditions brought about by wars. For example, some historians estimate more of Napoleon's troops were killed by typhus than by Russian soldiers during their retreat from Moscow in 1812. Ireland and the Americas recorded several epidemics. In the 1830s, over 100,000 Irish died from outbreaks. In the U.S. between 1837 and 1873, outbreaks were recorded in Philadelphia, Concord, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C.""'Henrique da Rocha Lima, a Brazilian doctor, discovered the cause of epidemic typhus in 1916 while doing research on typhus in Germany. However, still over 3 million deaths were attributed to typhus during and after World War I. Delousing stations were frequently set up to try to reduce the rate of typhus infection and death among troops and civilians. Even though a typhus vaccine was developed before World War II, typhus epidemics continued, especially in German concentration camps during the Holocaust (Anne Frank died in a camp at age 15 from typhus). Eventually, DDT was used to kill lice at the end of World War II and only a few epidemics (Africa, Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia) have occurred since then. Because of toxicity, DDT has been banned in the U.S. since 1972.''Endemic typhus seems to be increasing or perhaps is being recognized and correctly diagnosed more often in the U.S. An example is the following: Although endemic typhus is usually found in cooler environments, in 2011, Travis County, Texas, (including Austin, Texas) was declared to be endemic for murine (endemic) typhus with 53 cases diagnosed. California also has endemic typhus. In 2018, Galveston County, Texas, reported 17 individuals with the disease -- the first time it was diagnosed there was 2012. Authorities suggest many more people may be infected but have not been diagnosed.' "
What causes typhus? How does typhus spread?,"'The causes of typhus are small Gram-negative coccobacilli-shaped bacteria, members of the genus ''Rickettsia'' that are intracellular parasites of many animals and utilize the components within the cell to survive and multiply. Typhus is sometimes generally labeled as flea-borne typhus, tick-borne typhus, or louse-borne typhus, depending on the vector that transmits the bacteria. They are difficult to cultivate because they usually only grow within cells they infect. Occasionally, the bacteria may become dormant in infected cells, and years later, again begin to multiply (causing Brill-Zinsser disease). Generally, typhus follows an animal (rat, mouse) to vector (louse, flea) cycle. Humans are incidentally infected usually when the vectors come in close proximity to humans. The two ''Rickettsia'' species responsible for the two main types of typhus are ''Rickettsia prowazekii'', the cause of epidemic typhus, and ''R. typhi'', the cause of endemic typhus. However, ''R. felis'', another species usually found in cat and cat fleas (''Ctenocephalides felis''), has been linked to people with endemic typhus also. Epidemic typhus usually spreads to humans from ''body lice'' (Figure 1) feces contaminated with ''R. prowazekii'' or occasionally from animal droppings contaminated with these bacteria. Endemic typhus usually spreads to humans by flea feces or animal droppings containing ''R. typhi'' or ''R. felis''. The flea or louse (''Pediculus humanus'') bite causes ''itching'' and scratching and may allow the bacteria to enter the scratch or bite area in the skin. Indirect person-to-person transmission of rickettsiae can occur if infected fleas or lice infect one person who develops the disease and then the infected lice or fleas move from person to person by direct contact or via shared clothing. In general, ''head lice'' that differ from body lice do not transmit ''Rickettsia''.'  "
What are typhus risk factors?,"'Typhus risk factors include living in or visiting areas where the disease is endemic. These include many port cities where rat populations are high, and areas where trash accumulates and hygiene may be low. Disaster zones, homeless camps, poverty-stricken areas, and other similar situations that allow rodents to come into close contact with people represent the greatest threats. These are the same type of conditions that lead to outbreaks of ''cholera'', ''tuberculosis'', and viral diseases like ''influenza''. Spring and summer months are when fleas (and ''ticks'') are most active, but infections can occur any time of the year.' "
What are typhus symptoms and signs?,"'Symptoms of endemic typhus develop within about one to two weeks after initial infection and may include a high fever (about 105 F), ''headache'', malaise, ''nausea'', ''vomiting'', and ''diarrhea''. A petechial rash on the chest and abdomen typically begins about four to seven days after the initial symptoms above develop, and the rash often spreads. Some patients may also have a ''cough'' and ''abdominal pain'', ''joint pain'', and ''back pain''. Symptoms may last for about two weeks and, barring complications or death (less than 2% die), symptoms abate.''However, epidemic typhus symptoms, although initially similar to endemic typhus, become more severe. The rash may cover the entire body except the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the ''feet''. Patients may develop additional symptoms of bleeding into the skin (petechiae), delirium, stupor, ''hypotension'', and ''shock'', which can be life threatening.'  "
How do health care professionals diagnose typhus?,"""Medical professionals base their diagnosis on the patient's clinical history, physical exam, and tests based on identification of the bacterial genus and species by PCR testing of a ""'skin biopsy'' from skin rash or lesions, or blood samples. Immunohistological staining can identify the bacteria within infected tissue (skin tissue, usually). Typhus can also be diagnosed, usually late or after the disease has been treated with antibiotics, when significant titers of anti-rickettsial antibodies are detected by immunological techniques. Although some state labs may do these tests, health care professionals should contact the CDC for testing questions and be given information if there is an outbreak of epidemic typhus. These tests help distinguish between epidemic and endemic typhus, ''anthrax'', and other viral diseases.' "
What is the treatment for typhus?,"'Physicians recommend antibiotic therapy for both endemic and epidemic typhus infections because early treatment with antibiotics (for example, azithromycin, doxycycline, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol) can cure most people infected with the bacteria. Consultation with an infectious-disease expert is advised, especially if epidemic typhus or typhus in ''pregnant'' females is diagnosed. Delays in treatment may allow renal, lung, or nervous system problems to develop. Some patients, especially the elderly, may die.' "
What is the prognosis of typhus?,"'Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment yield an excellent prognosis for almost all patients with any of the types of typhus. Delayed, undiagnosed, or untreated typhus has a less promising prognosis, but the prognosis is related to the type. For example, untreated endemic typhus has a death rate under 2% of patients, but untreated epidemic typhus has a death rate that ranges from about 10%-60% of infected patients, with those over 60 years of age having the highest death rates. Even if the patient does not die, complications that may worsen the prognosis in endemic and epidemic typhus to fair or poor are renal insufficiency, ''pneumonia'', and central nervous system problems.' "
Is it possible to prevent typhus? Is there a typhus vaccine?,"'Efforts to prevent typhus have been successful when people are able to avoid contact with the vectors that spread typhus (mainly fleas and lice) or fecal droppings from rodents. In areas where endemic typhus exists, or in outbreaks of epidemic typhus, efforts to treat domestic animals to rid them of fleas are good preventive measures. Many experts suggest that good sanitation, flea-control measures, and reducing populations of rats, mice, and other animals that may carry the bacteria and their vectors is effective. Use insect repellents and insecticides (for example, 1% malathion or 1% permethrin) if fleas and lice reside in the local environment. If the problem is lice and boiling clothing is not an option, avoiding any physical contact with infested clothing for five days will allow the lice to die because they need a blood meal in less than five days to survive. Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine for endemic or epidemic typhus. The CDC does not recommend taking any antibiotics to prevent the disease.' "
